Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.|You're all set.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.|Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
Hey!|Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
I'm still looking through mine...|Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.|
You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so…|Shhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh! Shhhhh!
Hey, hey!|Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|Hi David. Chandler. Monica...  Oh!
I'll tell you at the wedding.|More than I wanna get married.
So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?|Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.|I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
Great.|Bye.  Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?|Shana Goldberg-Meehan & Scott Silveri
Jack, look at this.|Alright, 5 more minutes.
But we do!  It's gonna be ok, Rach!|Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hey, what's going on Joe?
We need to talk to you about something.|No, no! We made this decision together.
Ok.|Ready sweety?
And a crappy New Year.|Here, here!
Incentive For Men?|Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?
That's great!  I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...|You gotta be at least bi...
Not until you said it. Somebody switch!  Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.|That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Actually it's both of us.|What?
Of course, I'd be honored!|Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|I always loved that!!
Hi.|Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?|Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Dude, dude! I think you're losing it.
Hey!|Hey...
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath ... is all man.
Molly ... people don't study acting ...|Thanx.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.|I don't know sweetie.
... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!|Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?|Are you asking permission to break the pact?
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|We must go now, quickly, please.
Is this cool, huh?|
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.|Still sharp as a tack!
Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend .|Sit down.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|Oh my God! My God! We've got the house !?
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|You know, I'm really sorry I wasn't more supportive before.
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.|Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
Night.|Ok, good night!
What about your massage client?|Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
Hi|listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Dude, I wanted him to guess.
You did it!|Robert Carlock
Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .|Yeah, hey.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?
Hey Phoebe!|Hey!
You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.|Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.|I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.|Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!
What did you get her?|Actually we prepared performances.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Goody, what is it!
I know  but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.|I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.|Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Really? You think?|Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
Okay.  Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.|It's over! You have to accept that.
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Hey.
Can I adopt you?|Hey, you must be Owen.
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?|Yeah.
Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?|No, wait, you don�t have my phone number!
I'm so sorry!|No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
Uhuh.|Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Oh!|Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?|Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
Miss?|No, you don't.
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.|"Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.|Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa|Oh Ross Geller
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming? That means we get five dollars each!
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!|Oh God! What did I just step on?
Hey you guys.�|Hey.� I'll be right back.� I've got to go to the bathroom.�
I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.|Y’know I can’t even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can’t believe how much I love her, I can’t get enough of her, like right now I miss her.  I actually miss her.
All right.|Okay, bye.
I know, I still need to talk to you.|About what?
this is my wife, Nancy.|Oh my God, wh-what happened?
Isn’t she beautiful?|I guess.
No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!|Who's Gladys?
See ya!|Did that guy really make that joke?
Good job.|Thank you.
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|Oh my God!
Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.|Phoebe!
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.
Miss?|I - I have to get on the plane.
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Yeah, why?|Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
Phoebe did the signs!|Well, you more then me, but he can’t stay to mad at me. I mean, I just had his baby.
And you're thinking of taking it?  new job.|I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...|My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
Was that place... The Sun?|Oh! And it gets worse!
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?|What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...|Yes?
I have nothing to say to you.|Please, Monica? In the hall?
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|I have a ring.
If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.|Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!
Cheers.�|You know, it's funny.� I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.� � Hi ya.
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.|Oh wait, Joey and I are supposed to have dinner .
Hi!  Excuse us.|Please...
Oh my god you're right.|I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own baby! I’m the worst mother ever!|You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away"
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?  We'll take it.|Great.
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...|Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.
All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so|Ok. First of all, this is green!
Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.|Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
Dude. You're married to my sister.|You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|What?
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?|Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Sorry.
You really think so?|I really do.
Celebrity.|I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.|Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
That-that’s him! You know him?|Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?|Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
My dear, sweet Rach.|Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..|Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. . I've made my decision. I choose them.
It's really gone?|You know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.|The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
Good morning, everybody.|Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|Who?
Why?|Hey, hey!  Boo us? Boo you!
Sure.|Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.
Your lipstick's on his mouth.|Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
Will you wear a thong?|I will if you will.
Nooo!|Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
Huh, I might be losing interest in this.|Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.
We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.|Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.|Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.|Rachel Green?  Son of a bitch, she came back?
Frank Jr.Jr.?|Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
Hey you guys.�|Stout.� That's a kind of beer.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
Is it an engagement ring?|Yes!
Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.� Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?|Yeah.� � Yeah, I'm sorry.� I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it.
Heh.|What?
Yeah...|Kori? Kori Weston?
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|, but you're going to realize, this is the only place, you wanna be.
Yeah...|I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.|It's gonna be ok.
I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.|Breaks your heart doesn’t it
Ok, we're still on that.|Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?|Ah, Rachel I guess.
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?|Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!|So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.|Oh, please, we're happy to help.
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
No-no-no, wait! We need something old!|Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
Whazzup??|Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Um.. I'm a decorator.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|There's no room under the bed.
Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?|I wouldn't read too much into it.
Oh|Hi
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer...  Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!|Judd Rubin
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.|Did you get the grant?
Monica?|Gary Halvorson
I understand...|You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
What? You are way off, lady!|Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Yeah, where were you!|Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?|sure.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?
Then, again at 9:00?|uh-huh.
I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can..|Why don't you turn them inside ou...
I'm still looking through mine...|Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.
I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart...|Ross!
|You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Work, Joe!|Just pass it to your boss!
Yah.|You are incredible. Unless, I�I�m not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
I know what this is all about... You've always been|Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.|
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.|Mike?? Who's Mike?
You thought about that?|Yeah.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.
Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace|You already hit on me an hour ago
How do you fix the chair?|Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
No.|Oh, man, I'm not going to be able to handle this.  Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year. And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...|Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in|.
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.|Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.|Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.|Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.|Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|So, what did you decide?
Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.|Really? The scientist guy?
Thank you guys for having us over.|Wow!
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.|Sure you do.
this is my wife, Nancy.|Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?|Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!
I know.|How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
Ye....|Hi! There you are.
They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?|Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
So who are you?|Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...|What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
Excuse me?|Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|I know.
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!|My coat...
Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.|FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
Yes, but we have to be fast.|How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.|No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married.|No-no. We…
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.|Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Ah, our little ones are growing up fast, uh?
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?|No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
You didn’t do anything wrong?!|I said I didn’t technically.
Good job.|Well, you're not,  You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|Well hello !
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!|Thank you, thank you very much!
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!|Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
You got it!  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!|You guys hear a ringing?
Thanks.� � Here's your ticket.|Hey, listen.� I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Unless what?
Oh, really?|No!  You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
Well, just... let's try it again.|Ok.
Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.|I silk-screen t-shirts now.
No way!|You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Who is it?|Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this  replica.
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?|I don't think so.
Hey you.|Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I’m really more of a candy guy.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|Oh, they're real!
I know, I hate being left out of things.|And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
No! We're gonna do it my way.  Hello?|Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice.  That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?
I have to go to the bathroom.|I can’t believe it!  She’s asleep!  I got her to go to sleep!   I have actual magical powers!
Okay!|I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
What? What?|I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but I thought you should know.
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.|Well, you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.|Uh, Phoebe, uh, I have... something I wanna say.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|That is why!
Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.|Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Okay.
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|Oh, what about this one.
Thank you.|And what is his name?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hi, hey.
Really? Wh-what's wrong?|I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?|Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
Incentive For Men?|Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.
Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.� But um. . .|Then, can I have your number?
Ok, yeah, got it.|Okay.
Yeah...|Yeah...
Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.|
We got some time.|Okay, should we get some coffee?
Who's Nancy?|Why do you have a realtor?
Thank you!  Oh, and I have something for you!|Mmh-mmh!
I don't even know what that's for.|You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Rach, Rach, knock knock.|Who's there?
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.|Thank you. It was so beautiful. <gets up and walks towards the front door> I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
Oh, mon Dieu!|Hey you guys.
Uh!|Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
Right, right, yes!|Don't panic!
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|You know.. this.. this is classic Rachel.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Aw..
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.|See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game.� You have to spend time with me."� So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!|Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
Well, the club lost it's power.|Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|Okay.
Nana liked it rough!|Oh, it was okay. I went to a movie with my cousin and then out for dinner. We went to this place that had... Ooh...  Hoo... ooh... Anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?|Oh, women can. You can't.
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.|All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we
Previously on Friends...|You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
*What*??|Well, she... she didn't win...
Hey, hey!|Oh my god!
Wow.|What?
What?|This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..|What are you gonna name the baby?
I am sooo drunk.|Oh THATS ME!
Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!|I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.
Me! I'm up for puppets!|Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.|Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!
Hey, hey!|I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.|Thank you?
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.|Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
Here we go!|Oh, she’s so tiny.  Where’d she go?
That bastard taped over me!|Is that a problem?
Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...|YOU! You feel!
Well, get back in there and talk!|I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!|You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
Can I adopt you?|I'm adopted?
Okay.|Alright.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Yeah...
Hey.|Oh I’m kinda part of this.
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?|Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|We are on a roll, people!!
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.|Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
Oh, DAMN IT!|Ok.
Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!|You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...|Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|Hey!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|She's gonna be a scientist!
Uh-huh.|You guuuyys.
Yeah?|About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.|Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
Ohhhh! These seats are great!|I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
Yeah! This feels really good.|I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.|Alright! Just follow my lead!
So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!|No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.
We need to talk to you about something.|Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.|You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
Oh for the love of God!|And here it is!
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.|Hi...
Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.|Oh...how much?
Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.|Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
You need both hands for that?|Yeah, I kinda do.
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.
What are you doing here, Santa?|Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
...If-you-say-so.|Yeah?
Well, uh...|Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you like to make love to me?
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.|You're wearing the same shirt.
We're just making conversation.|I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.|Actually, I think you’re ready to go to the delivery room.
She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.|So fellas
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|
Ehm, we were friends in 1992.|calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
But now she'll never know how he feels!|What?
You slept out here?|Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.|God works in mysterious ways.
Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.|No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.|Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!
|� So, you're a paleontologist, right?
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Oh my God!
No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.|Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.|Ok.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
One thousand...|OK!
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!|Yeah, I’m not so sure.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?|Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.|This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was…
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|I had a great time.  It was really top drawer. And here's something rich: thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.|. I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?
Everything doesn't sound fine!|Bert and Ernie!
We've been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.|Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.
I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?|Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!|Yes and you talked to her...
Give me the bag.|Hit me.
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|Bye.
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|Pheebs!
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|Hey.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Hi Monica.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived.
Heh.|I'm sorry you guys but, you know, Mike's got his brother and his friends from school so... you know, you were-you were... if it helps you, you were next in line, you just-you just missed the cut.
What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!|Hey, your English is getting better!!
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.|That money is mine, Green!
Oh, I like my job.|I'm sorry, I won't be here.
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|So... who's your friend?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.|Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.|I didn't know Monica had these!
Hey, hey!|Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|That’s not her name! I’m sorry, she just doesn’t feel like an Isabella.
Oh my God!� I love things.� What happened?|Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.� And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.|Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Yeah.
Ok honey. that was close.|Nooooooooo!
You need both hands for that?|
Other wall, people! Other wall!|And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
Hey.|Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
I have to go to the bathroom.|It worked! Ooh baby baby baby, ooh baby baby baby!
Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.|What, is he your pet rat?
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?|Ok, let’s work from the top down!  Just work the bra, Joe!
You ducked!!|I’m sorry! It was a reflex!
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|No, what?
What?|It's not bad.
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.|Thank you.  All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.|Uh, was that good for you?
Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?|Lima.
Hey!|Hi!
Hmmm-mmmm.|Not even one more time?
So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to|
Oh man! I have to get those done too?!|Wow! Talking about high maintenance
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.
Hey!|Hey!
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|Have a seat.  I cannot allow this.
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|Alright, I'm gonna go find them...  Okay, I see you later.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Hey, Rach, how's it going?
Oh. This was amazing.|It really was. You've learned some new moves!
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.|Uh... November?
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Well, I can do it.
Yeah.|Comb my eyelashes.
Excuse me?|Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement.|Surprised?
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .|Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy.  This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!|Also so gay!
So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?|Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.
Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.|Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?� � I heard it.
Are you serious?|So you're gonna move?
Who's Nancy?|What's going on?
|So where are you applying to?
Oh God!|Oh!
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.|Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule.  Oh, can't you make an exception?"
Sure, I know lots of girls.|Yeah? Any names come to mind?
Oh wait.. What are you doing?|Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.
|Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Sure, we don't live there but...
Excuse me?|Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?|No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Well, then so you just invite me...!
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed ... I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.|Monica and Chandler's apartment.
Wow, this is a lot!|Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
Right. So, it'll be the same except… less sex with you.|So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
Previously on Friends...|Joey, it would mean so...
Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"|I want one.
Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!|On every word?
You didn't hear the speech!|I've heard the speech:  "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... "
Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"|Yeah I do rock that one.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
Mine.|I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
No, that seems about right.|Joey, that was formula.
Who's Nancy?|Yeah  I'm not having an affair. Nancy is our realtor.
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...|Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
What you got?|Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.|Really?
Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.|Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
AH YEAAAAH!|Do you really find this attractive on him?
You did it!|Tracy Reilly
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|You had a bathroom break at 2030. Pee on your own time, Mike! . Now, in regard to the toast, okay, you wanna keep them short, nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. Okay. You just get in, do your thing and get out!
Yeah.|It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Why not?
What do you really want to do?|
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Hey!
Who is it?|I meant with my son.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|I like although!
Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.|Totally. I had sex in High school...
Oh!|Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. .
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?|Why does everyone keep saying that?
Oh, sorry.|Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?|I'd love to!
Oh wait.. What are you doing?|Setting the table.
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".|Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
Celebrity.|Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
: how do you know I have one of those?|I'm Hayley.
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!|Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!
Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.|All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|I'm smarter than him!
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?|Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!
Jack, look at this.|We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
It's "Bolero" from "10".|It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Ketchup!
Wow!|Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !|oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|I could get a goose!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|No, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her since like the ninth grade.
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.|'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|Do, do you gonna do it now?
Who is it?|Gavin! I brought you some soup.
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.|Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.|Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?|I don't know. Except that, for one last time...  Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
She's asleep.|Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
Previously on Friends...|Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.|Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one
A friend-ship...|Oh, I gotta go.
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|Monica, you understand what we are saying, right?
NO! No, no!|YES!
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm.. That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now. I love you. Do not get on this plane.
Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!|Phoebe!!
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?|No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Incentive For Men?|So can we keep this between us?
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?|I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
What?|I’ll come back for her later.
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this|Are those my wife�s nipples?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
Whoo-hoo!|You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.
Well, I... I am having a good hair day.|Me too.
I said it's still nap time.|Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.|Um, Mon, Chandler�s not here.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?|Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Relish!
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
Hey!|Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?|We are moving along, just slowly.
Why?|Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family.
Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.|Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews  And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
Okay.|Okay.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|You take that back.
Today.|You said two weeks.
But... but... but we're giving you this!|Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution.
You can't move. You just... you just can't.|Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Oh!
Kate Miller it is.|And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
That's my bubby!|Yeah. . . I'm sorry.� We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys.� I, I have a boyfriend.
I'm still looking through mine...|You bet! No TV or anything!
Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I�m gonna take off.|What?
Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re talking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf.|Oh!
Oh... then I overpaid.|Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?|Kevin S. Bright
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?|Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?|I thought I was something that we both wanted!
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|Daddy?!
What? They will be!|Why do men keep talking to me like this?
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.|Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
But he's the same.|Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Can we at least try living together? I mean you might change your mind about marriage.
Can I adopt you?|What?!?
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Twins! Twins!!
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|The woman you what?
I lent them to Ross.|Come on guys, PUSH!
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.|Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.
Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.|You still want that baby?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.|No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Hi.|Hi.
Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!|She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|I don't want it to end either.
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.|It's OK!
Well, just wake him up!|I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
Yay!|Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
Get your garlic-peelers off me!|
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|"Go, go!"
Wait! Oh wait!|Ready?
I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god  what's wrong with me.|no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Oh yeah? Well thanks.
You might want to keep practicing.|Is that really necessary?
Hey!|Hi!
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with.  Hey!
Yay.|What? Why?
How come?|What do you do with your money now?
Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.|It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!|Hang on, she’s right here.  Someone's on the phone, for ya.
Wow...definitely just Drake...|What?
Bye, see ya.|Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.
You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?|Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
Okay, my turn. My turn.  I won’t.|The doctor says it’s completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you’re sleep deprived.
Oh! Right.|That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.|Yeah. I guess so.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|A lot of people are thankful for those.
Yay!|Well tell us! What are they?
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.|Oh, I really liked him.  Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.|Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|We're growing up.
Hey, Rachel!!|Oh!
Why?|Mike Hannigan... will you marry me?
Okay.|No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Oh!
Incentive For Men?|You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.
Oohh, I love it!|Really? You're not gonna return it?
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|RACHEL!!
Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.|Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
That was kind of rude!|Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Things that burn.
So?|So...I've never played that!
It’s a funny story, actually.  I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know what I was saying.|You fell asleep?
Oh.|See what I mean . . .
Care to venture a guess?|May 12th?
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.|Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too!  Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
Thats not how you see me, is it?|No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?|Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|That was me.
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?|Hey.
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!|We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.|For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?|Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Rach?
Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.|What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?|I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.|Hi!
What else did you think about?|Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise.|: I'm gonna go freshen up ok
Jack, look at this.|To the bathroom!
Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.|Ok, you got it!
Yay.|Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left Philange.
I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.|Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
Leave it.|I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn�t have sex with me while we�re fighting.
You’re never leaving the apartment!|Say what?
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.|Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.|To Ross!
Joe...|Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
Sex! This is the last day I�m ovulating, and when we don�t do it now, we�ll have to wait till next month.|You serious?
Sure.|Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Chandler was how old when he first touched a girl’s breast?
A place to entertain my lady friends.|And what else is it not?
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|What? What are you gonna do?
Ow...Oh Gosh!|10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.
Previously on Friends.|Oh my God!
Did someone drop the baton again?|Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
|I guess.
Ooh, and treat it is.|Hmhmm.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey Rach.|Yeah.
If you want to check your email, just ask!|What's with the rain, Geller? I mean, when I signed up for Dino Week, nobody said anything about it being monsoon season.
All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.|Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
Really?|Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!|Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.|Hey.
Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.|Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Hey!|Hey! Got champagne?
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...|What's going on?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|
Well, I was thinking...|Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?|No.
You know what. I think this audition is over.|Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
Well, the club lost it's power.|I think I wanna get married to you today.
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...|Yeah, that'll do it.
Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.|Seriously, you're an intern?
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
Yay.|Could I get some peanuts?
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|This might be my one chance to have a baby Rachel. I mean, you know that I have been so busy focusing on my carrer.
You're so efficient. I love you!|Let's go!
You what? You said you liked them.|Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Oh my God!
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!|Argh. fascist
Do you have to go?|You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Hey, Missy...|You know, our band is playing on Friday.
You might want to keep practicing.|It's Joey.� � Hey Joe.
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.|That's worse than no food.
At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....|Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
Jack, look at this.|We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
Yay!|What?
I'll tell you at the wedding.|You know what, I can't do this. I don't know which one of you guys to pick.
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...|Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh Amy, don't cry Amy.  Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?
Do you have any ideas?|
Hey!|So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
God, I wish Mike were here.|What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|It's like a giant hug.
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|Have you thought about what you would be giving up? You can't move out of the city, what if you want Chinese food at 5am? Or a fake Rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an Asian hooker sent right to your door?
I lent them to Ross.|What's going on?
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Oh wait, oh no. Wait.
Hi|Listen, I think I've left something here.
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.|Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
Jack, look at this.|No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.|Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|I love you.
Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?|people  so why you all dressed up.
What's Emma doing today?|Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Oh, around 8:30?|Yeah.
Oh!|I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|Sorry David, but she really has to know this.
That was a test and you just failed.|I believe I read that somewhere!
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?|Well, not anymore.
I love you more!|Not possible!  She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going to make excellent parents.|LAURA!
Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.|Tell me more.
Why?|I heard you were sick...
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
Yeah, he came up...|Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
That was amazing.|I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
Bye, see ya.|So-so what did the doctor say?
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|Hey!
I understand...|Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
Yeah!|I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
Hmm, yeah.  Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.|Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Fancy guest.
No, I-I-I love it there.|What?
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Ok. Hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight. So tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know, but Mike and I didn't get off to the best start.  but despite, you know... it got... it got good. Ok, I wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here...
Yeah?|You blew them away!
Incentive For Men?|See, I told you I needed someone! Oh, you know, by the way, as a "thank you", I would really love to take you out.
If you want to check your email, just ask!|May I?
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?|There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
Date of birth?|November 16th, 1968.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.|And you're not helping?
Estrangement .|Okay, fine, I�ll move. Alright, you don�t have to manhandle me.  Okay. Thank you. Wach.
Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".|Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
Sure.|Okay.
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?|Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!
OH!|Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|But I'm bursting with u-hu!
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?|These are amazing!
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...|Not to mention the cold sores.
You are not at Thanksgiving?|What are you doing here!
What?|I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.|You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Thats not how you see me, is it?|So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|What?!
Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?|That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?
Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.|I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.|It's all right. You can mourn.
They could be our neighbors, what are they like?|Oh my God!
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...|King?
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
I lent them to Ross.|There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets|No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And
Isn’t she beautiful?|Because it kinda looked like I did.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.|That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.|Wow... I did not see this coming.
Oh, me too...|Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
I like those odds!|How do you know she's gonna start talking?
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|Ok, how about... uhm... sex or dinosaurs?
All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.|Alright, what are we gonna say?
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Alright. Thats it! <Pushes Amy back>
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?|But maybe we can have dinner later? On the balcony? Will be romantic.
Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?|Good, good, life is good...
Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.|Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
You are the official baby crier stopper!|Yes I am!!
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time!
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?
Oh, thank God.|Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|No.
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!|I didn't say anything yet!
That tape was never meant to be seen by...  Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.|
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?
You won awards?|She's in her room, why?
Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".|Very cool.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!|It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring! That’s why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.
I mean this is so great! We’re gonna be baby buddies!|Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.|Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
Hi!|Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Son of a bitch!
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?|I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Your family name is Tribbiani.
Oh... okay.|And a thousand dollars.
I'll let you get acquainted.|I don't know about that.
I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!|Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!
Other wall, people! Other wall!|
Really? Wh-what's wrong?|Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|Sure what kind?
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|Oh, just this woman I�ve been seeing.
So... what do you say?|Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Oh.
Wher-where have you been?|I�ll give you another minute.
They loved it.|What?
But now she'll never know how he feels!|I don't! I wanna be with her.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|You making fun of me? Because I am not a sell-out.  I didn't do that for the money, I believe in those phones. I almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Supermodels!
I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.|Hi
Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.|There's no man in here.� How dare you accuse me of that.�
I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?|You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke.|Oh my god.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?|Damnit woman we’re losing precious time! Now do you want this man’s blood on your head?
What's up?|Is that Ross?
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.|Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
Humiliating and noble!|Yes, I did, I did!  I should have written it down!
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Chickens?
I guess you're right.|You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
Chandler gets pedicures!|Why...why?
Celebrity.|I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.|Well, how you died was funny.
I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.|A love scene? With who?
Give me the bag.|No, look, I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Get out!
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|You gonna buy a new one?
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.|Hello.
Yep.|So I guess Rachel had you baby?
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.|: you don't think sharks are sexy do you?
She has a lot of crap!|You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...
Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.|Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.
Hey!|It's all done!
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!|My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|OW, why, why, why?
Why not?|Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|Nope, just the one. RACH!
So, you just let her go?|Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye?
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.|That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.|Okay.
no it's not ringing any bells.|Ooooooooooh, I slept with you! And you obviously remember me Hey! I still got it.  I'll let myself out.
Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...|You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".|Better.
Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?|Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
Game?|Ooh! That's my girl!
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|Weirdest thing. Did I hear——Mother of God it’s true!
We're just making conversation.|No I didn't.
I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.|I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
Oh, yay!|Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hey you.
Well, I hope, you got some room left.|� Joey, happy birthday to you.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!
Wow|Here!
Hey!|Joey, that is not gonna work.
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.|There's a hair in my coffee.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.
I understand...|Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Hey, I think Emma might like it!
Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.|Oh, sure. I’m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
Oh my God!|I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!|Phoebe, what happened?
Yeah, sure!|Oh ...
Really? Wh-what's wrong?|... Ok, who is this?
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|You don't love him!
You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.|Ah?� � Do you have one here?
She’s gonna be fine. Okay, she’s in a more difficult position so you’re gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!|Go!
Hey!|Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
oh, honey..|Please.. please, we are so close.
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...|That's where people make number two!!
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...|Monica!
Name one of his books.|"The Firm"?
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.|What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.|Sorry.
It's really gone?|Get out!
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.|Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Rach, these are for you.|Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?|Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
Yeah.|Oh! That's great!
What happened?|Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Seriously... What is it?
Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...|Musty!
Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't.� But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.|I'm sorry. �That's the one thing I can't do.� I promised I'd be with Monica.
Ow, that had to hurt!|We will.
Shake it!|Shake that nasty butt...
OK!|You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
All right.|You should go to the game.� It's okay.� I want you to.
It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.|: Ross?
Aw � what?|Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby�s sock is on the ground.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.|Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
Incentive For Men?|So, you know what, I really like those jackets with the shoulder pads on them. Where do you think those would be?
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Hi.
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Really?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.|Never?
Oh, why? What's up?|Yeah, you really shouldn't.  By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
Ok, we're still on that.|Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it"!
Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?|Uh-huh.
Nighty-night!|So, how did your audition go today?
No.|She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?|Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
Yay.|Ma'am, please sit down!
What are you doing?|Probably wanna know what I'm doing…?
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?
Uh!|Zack!
So he hasn't called?|would you call this girl?  thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.|Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.|Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
No-ot for me it doesn’t.|We’re great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
Uh-hmm.|You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
This room’s available.|Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you! And my husband  he’s a lawyer!
I see, and Dr. Biely?|Three for excavation and two for analysis.
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.|Okay, bye.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.
Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?|Uh...well...just once...with you...
Yay!|Oh honey, but you love that name.
I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.  I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.|Uh.  Did you call your parents?
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?|Remoray. It’s Portuguese. We need that information; I’m a doctor.
Previously on Friends...|What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married ... and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|But well, now that we're together again, I don't ever want to be apart. So, to that end...
Can you believe they're still not here?|I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.|Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?
Ross...|Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good.  Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!|Can't really say!
No, my parents are rich.|Yeah, so... They gotta die someday.  HELLO!
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!|At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.|Ah, and where is Joey?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.|It's so nice to finally meet you!
Hey, so how is it?|I broke my thumb.
Look, we can’t stay in here forever.|Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Ok|I'll see you tomorrow.
Glad I could help man.|Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but...  I made it work.
What are you talking about? Sarah's great!|Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok?  We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
So you forfeit?|Because I'm gonna play for ya.
No.|Okay.�
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?|Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?
Congratulatioooons!|Really girls, not cool.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?|Isn't that cute?
Really? Okay, so...|Know when to stop.
So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!|Oh hey Rach!
You're not making the pies yourself?|Can't wait!
What? They will be!|So, you’re saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
Oh ok.|Listen...this is really nice. Do you...  Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. .
Incentive For Men?|Wha, you know, maybe we can do something else!
You didn't like that?|Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!
You took the same class twice.|Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|I don't think so. Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby's. They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|Huh?
Yeah! Good night!|Goo--ood night!
Yeah! This feels really good.|Hey, it’s not my business,  besides it’s probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing…
Ross...|Congratulations!
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.|Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. .
Hi!|Hey!
Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.|Nice party.
We need to talk to you about something.|Hey!
Sure.|Bye
Yeah, Ross is here so...|Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|So, shall we read?
Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.|Chandler!� You're home!
So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...|I am learning so much from you.
Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?|Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|Stop going through my stuff !
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Bitchin'
Hi.|Oh God.�
Football? Just football?|Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!|Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.|Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
Hey!|Here you go!
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?|We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
NO BIG DEAL!|It's so not a big deal!
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|Ok, go quick!
That's my bubby!|All right. It's no big deal.
Oh, damn it!|I sleep with him!
That's terrible!|Yeah, she was just an agent.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.|What?!
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!|Tell me to stop, just...tell me to stop.
Oh, I hear divorce bells.|Alright, lady, now give me your purse!
...and head to Canada!|I was kidding.
Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!|No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
I'll tell you at the wedding.|What? A dog? No! Rachel gets to choose.
Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.|Mhm... it's moist.
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?|Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
They could be our neighbors, what are they like?|Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she…
Who is it?|Oh!
Then what's that big lump under your covers?|It's Monica, ok?
If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.|Oh my God!!
No!|Hit me! Hit me!
Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".|Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
Bye.|I mean we don’t want to go down that road do we?
...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.|Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!|Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
Who is it?|Not good, Ron.
Gotcha.|Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Okay!
Uh-huh!|Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!|Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Well, I took it.|That's great! So you're staying in New York!
Arghhh! Double standards!|Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross
Hey, hey!|I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: "Science Boy"
What are you doing?|Setting rat traps.
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?|Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!|What are you, a child?
Ok, we're still on that.|Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?|Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
Hurry!|Okay!
Your hands are shaking.|I know, and I can't stop sweating.
So did I|Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.|I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
Oh, she's still napping|Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time|Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Oh good, you haven't left yet.|Where have you been?
And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.|I know.
I'll watch her.|Why would you do that?
Yeah. Why?|Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?|No.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.
I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.|No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|Oh good...
No.|Oh really!?
Yay!|Take it.
You might want to keep practicing.|Can you . . . hear him . . . now?
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!|Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
I hope Ross isn't too upset.|Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.
of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.|but you did say it
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Oooooh!
Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.|Absolutely.
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Okay.
Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.|Really? She... she loves me?
O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.|Dude, are you okay?
Well, I hope, you got some room left.|Joey! Joey.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh okay. How about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!
Somebody went to college. Wow.|No, I’m sorry. It’s just my foot itches like crazy.
But I already told Zelner that I would come back...|I'm sure he'll understand.
All the time when you're cooking.|What?
Well it stupid, unfair question!|Don’t blame the questions!
Oh!|Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?|Hey.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,|Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?|Rach, try holding her a different way.
Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.|Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|You know, I think that�s a good idea�our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet.  Bye, y�guys.
I said it's still nap time.|And starting to think about settling down!
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|Please, what about you and Chandler?
Sure.|Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!|Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
That really was an incredible wedding.|It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.|I know
I watched it!|Keep going Pinocchio!
I don’t think so.|Right!
No.  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?|Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Hey!
So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.|Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!
Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!|We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|Ok.
Here we go!|Oh she’s…she’s perfect.
Jack, look at this.|Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby’s face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. . That is a weird sentence!
It's really gone?|Well, I usually go... play Tetris on somebody else's computer.
You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.|My kid's in a play right now.
I want Gladys!|She's mine!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hey. Hey where's the baby?
That was a test and you just failed.|I don't have a page.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?|Hi!
That's what I was doing too.|Well, you have fun tonight.
Incentive For Men?|Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
this is my wife, Nancy.|Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|My god in heaven.
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|What?
My name in Mike, and I do play piano.|Prove it.
There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.|What's so bad about that?
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|I know, I know, and you were right Ross.  You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!
Yay!|Yeah, I’ve had them picked out since I was fourteen.
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?|Yes, you did! And don’t you say, "No, I didn’t!"
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.|Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?|
so you don't think I'm a total freak|No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
Hey, where have you been?|Ha! I'm just messing with you.
Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!|what?
So, why did you break up?|Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
You won awards?|You haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?
Really? I don't really feel like it.|This is what I want to do.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Yeah, he's better!
All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.|Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.|Incidentally, when are you coming back?
I think I hear curtains closing...|We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Oh. Yeah. Well.. You didn't come see me when I was in the hospital when I was getting my lips done.
Previously on Friends.|Erica, are you okay?
These aren't suede.|Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?
Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!|That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Come on! I think this is funny!
Oh!|Hi.
Are you friends with him?|I can explain... Joey...
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Things that go "tssst" when you put them out.
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|The woman I love...  I love you... Which is probably something I shouldn't say for the first time in front of my parents... and Tom and Sue...Who are by the way the most sinfully boring I've ever met in my life...
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Really?� But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.� If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
Hell, yeah!|No idea! I though he was soft like you!
I'm dead and no one cares?|I look like a man??
I'm so sorry...|Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
Hey! How was basketball?|Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?|I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
Arghhh! Double standards!|OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
You won awards?|Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!
Well, this is very generous!|Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|No, what's more important, your friends or money?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Pass!
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.|Hey, listen. Call me.
It's a baby chick and duck!|Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?|We could, or we can have sex in it.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?|We were supposed to bring presents?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Tell me about it! "Unlimited nights and weekends!"
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Yeah!
In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now.|Oh, wait, wait!
I lent them to Ross.|I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
You gonna tell her?|Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.|Shall we? .
No, she was definitely on my bed.|Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.|Dude!
Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.|What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.|Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!
Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?|Three.
You still don't know my name, do you?|How've you been?
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Nah, I don't really want her to see.
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?|We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Yay!|Oh no, it’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn’t it?
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|We can't split them up!
Uh! Princess Consuela.|You seriously changed your name to that?
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.|I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|"I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!"
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?|Thank you.
Ross?|Huh?
Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!|Not knowing when to shut up...
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
You wouldn’t let her have a grape?|JOEY DOESN’T SHARE FOOD!
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|I love you.
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.|What do you think brought than on?
Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?|Ok.
Jack, look at this.|No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.|Right there! That was so fake!
Hi.|He's a pretty tough guy to impress.
Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom?|Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.
Merry Christmas.|
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.|I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing|No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Hey, where have you been?|Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?|I'm sorry, it's not here.
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?|.
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?|How about at a game, on the big screen?
Ah! I missed you|Oh, me too!
Oh yeah .|Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
That is not true. She did! She forced me!|Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.|Oh great, the pacifiers?
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
Hold on! There is something different.|I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?|Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?
Done it.  I'll be back in a couple of hours.|I'll miss you.
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.|Oh, yeah, yeah, good idea.
Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?|Yeah.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Oh, yah, sure.
Ok.|Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
We're back!|No, no, we're here to give the money back.
Me too.|Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
Arghhh! Double standards!|Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin!|I don't know why.
Excuse me?|Miss? Please, sit down!
No, but you know what I mean.|Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!
Wow! This place is beautiful!|I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!
You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..|Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?� � I heard it.|I'm just going to wait for a little while.
No!|OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
Never.|wow, are you still going to move in with him?
Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.|Okay I’ll take her, here.
Can I adopt you?|You wanna see it?
|Every time?
You still don't know my name, do you?|Ross, you know what?
I understand...|Okay... Good luck.
Today is the sixth.|No, it's not.
Hey!|It isn't working.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|So how're you doing?
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me...
Try feeding her again.|I already fed her.
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...|So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!
Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?|That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Yes!|Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
So?|[It�s just] So spooky, that�s all.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!
Nighty-night!|I'm begging you stop.
Well, I'm very impressed.|Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
Yes.|Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass".  Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.|I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|It is so amazing to meet you.  I'm such a big fan of your work.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?|I proposed to Chandler!  Alright, moving on...
Good weird?|Y’know what you guys? I’m uh, I’m gonna go too. And uh, I’m sorry about everything.
Hey, hey!|"Geology rocks!"
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.|Hey guys!
We’re so lucky.|We really are.
Oh, we are so lucky!|We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
How do you fix the chair?|Good, because it's in ten minutes.
Hey!|So, did you talk to Joey?
Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?|Half a dozen.
Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.|What?
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared.  It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
Hey!|Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
Joey's bare ass!|I love you too.
Do you have to go?|Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
Hey, hey!|You were?
Really? What's that like?|It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I�ve been looking for you everywhere!
I have to go to the bathroom.|I have to go scream into a pillow.
Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.|"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
Hey guys! Dinner's ready!|Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first.  Thanks!
Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.|He's not stoned.
You can't have it.|Give it to me!
I really, really am sorry.|Uhm... Did you just hit my dad?
You wanna fool around with Joey?|Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
You took the same class twice.|Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
Okay let’s put aside that you  "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.|Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this  You were saying?
Your boarding pass, please.|Oh.
Hi.|I'm sorry there wasn't better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options.
|Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two pack�a�a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days.  But it�s over, I made a decision, I�m not gonna smoke anymore.
Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?|I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|no I can't.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?|Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Pssst...
Yep, can you believe it?|Nope!  I still can’t believe she slept with you in the first place.
Merry Christmas.|Blah blargah, blar-blab.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!
Isn’t she beautiful?|Yeah right.
|WOW!
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|It's white!
|Hey!
: how do you know I have one of those?|oh I thought you said Hi.
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.|Excuse me?
There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.|I’m guessing she does.
Congratulations!|I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!|We're having a party.
I'm ok.|I'm sorry...  Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
Phoebe did the signs!|Oh Ah!  Oh you guys I love it.
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
That's shocking!|Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross!  He's rude!
I can't do that!|He says he can't do that.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|Hi! Hey look who’s here!
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Err, "I think you know".
Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?|This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.|That's true.  Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
Wow. Where is your luggage?|Damn it!
You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?|. That didn't make us sound gay at all!
Hey! What do you have there?|Oh my God! You did that yourself?
Who is it?|This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|Neither will I.
What? They will be!|Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|You are having a party tonight??
Wow!|Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Why not!
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.
The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?|Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
Jack, look at this.|Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
Yay.|Okay, that doesn't sound good.
Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t think you’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh?|I still can’t believe it! I’m the luckiest guy in the world!
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.|So, ah... Any plans for the summer?
Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another song!|Really? In front of all this people?
You still don't know my name, do you?|That is Mark?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Is everything okay?
Both of them?|No, one of them...
What?|Ten centimeters, you’re about to become a mom.
They're in a caaar...|Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.
Yeah.|What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|Uh, you're not gonna win.
|Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so I�m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.
I'm still looking through mine...|Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|Wow! Umm, okay uh…everyone…this…is Isabella.  What?
Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you, don't I?|Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.|Terry Hughes
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.|You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
I just have one question!|Shoot!
What? They will be!|Really?
I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.|That must have been hard.
Who is it?|Uh! The police!
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|Please take your time, it’s an important decision. Not like, say, I know! deciding to marry someone, this is about a muffin.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Hey, I gotta! Unless...
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Stupid Thanksgiving.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.|You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!|Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.|Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
Why don't you tell her my name?|This is my husband Crap Bag.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|Enter Amy!
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.|
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.|I can do that!  "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn|: really?
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|Oh, that is so sweet..
Ross said he died.|He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!|You didn't watch the tape.
Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...|
Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.|What are you saying?
Really?|Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Ok, that'll be great!
: maybe I will go  yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.|oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters.
Where are you going?|Game's tomorrow night Joe.
Aww!|Oh dear God, there's two of them!
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Ok.
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!
Stop it!|PHD
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.|Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: "Would you...
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.|Well... obviously!
I understand...|You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...
Are you friends with him?|Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
Hey, where have you been?|Really? What changed your mind?
Hello.|Hello
: how do you know I have one of those?|look I don't usually ask out women that I meet in coffeehouses
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?|Sorry, looks like it's just him.
Which one is which again?|"Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
Arghhh! Double standards!|So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...|And sexy.
All right.|What?
Yeah I bet! Look out!|OH! OWWWWW!
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.|Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! . Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.
I have nothing to say to you.|Well, aren't you a treat.
Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...|Oh no, I want to.
Your age?|That is great. Good work!
: hey Joey|Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?
Calm ourselves?|I do like fajitas.
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!|My father had an heart attack...  ...while I was at Barney’s.
Okay, look, just do it gently.|You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
You won awards?|Hey!
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!|Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
I understand...|Three months.
Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.|Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  That's a pretty necklace.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
We got some time.|Sure. Where?
Come on, lottery!!|Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Well, that’s what I’m here for.  Want me to get that?|Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it! Got it!
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.|Santa? Really?
And so incorrect!|She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
It's really gone?|I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?
Ha! My point!|He was a lawyer!
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|So, so now do I get Joey?
Hey, hey!|Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.
Really? Chandler?|Continue...
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Yeah...
Rachel said she’d marry you?!|
I'm so sorry...|I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?|Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
Jack, look at this.|Got it!  Where do you think you're going?
Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.|For what?
It could be Amanda!|Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Ross, um, don’t forget to get a shot of Emma’s cake. It’s in a box in the fridge.
Can I adopt you?|Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
Nighty-night!|Thats a bear.
uh-huh|And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?|Well then, you should look with us.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|Noo,  In high school, I once had sex with a girl right in the middle of the...
Who is it?|Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!|They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.|Phoebe and I are moving in together.
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.|: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
Did you uhm...|No, no...
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|No but... You don't want to get married either right?
Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.|Why?
Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.|
Well, come on...|Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... So where are you from?
Oh... then I overpaid.|Do you wanna go hunting?
Yeah, wow.|I was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
|Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...|Six o'clock!
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...
Yes?|Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Then what did happen?|Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!
I like those odds!|Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
|You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Next up is a marching band from Muskogee, OK.
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?|Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm...  Only... only not creepy.
I lent them to Ross.|Nice!
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  Oh, you... you like that?
...Valentine's day...|Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Rehearse it!
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Nice to meet you guys .
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?
Damn it!|Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!|Ok, don’t hold thy breath!
I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.|But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.|I know. It seems smaller somehow.
I'm sure you have better things to do.|Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.|Oh my God, that's just like my name!
Ok.|Here we go. Stand up straight.
Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.|Oh, no!
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!|But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
Good job.|Hey!
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.|What do you mean?
Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?|I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Yeah.
I thought I had to make the jokes!|Don't you have to be at work?
Yes I can!|No you can't. She's yours!
Hi!|Hi!
I love you too.|Allright. See you later!
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?|I don't know.
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!|I know!!! My erection is back!
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Take it back!
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.|Oh, you're so wonderful.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|You would think!
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in|Yeah, right!
Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.|What?
Oh, ye-ah!|You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
He's not having an affair!|You know, I'm always right about these things.
Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?|Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.|No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?
Yay!|I don’t want to say.
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.|I didn't mean now...
No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!|Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
That's my bubby!|So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation?
Wow! That was amazing!|Thank you so much for that gift!
OH!|Fine. I'll go. But let me ask you one question...
That was a test and you just failed.|You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
Toll-booth.|What?
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.|Look around, you guys. This was your first home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|I want to live with you too! Let's do that!
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.|Ok, how about this ?
We are even, right?|Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
OK!|Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Yes, we are.
Previously on Friends...|I got a really incredible job offer.
Oh my God! David!|Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.|Of course. I’ll always be your dad.
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.|Are you serious?
All right, let just try it again. Really listen.|Got it.
On...?|No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.|Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|
Of course, I'd be honored!|Hey!
No! No, you know what?|I was just going to say that I left my keys.
You can open your eyes now.|Are we off the bridge?
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.|Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.|It wasn’t fun?!
Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say "neither".|You went out with Wallis Pincer?
Hey!|Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"|Ready to go?
Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.|Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
Previously on Friends...|It's in Paris.
Is that it?|No, no, no, no, no!
I understand...|Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!|Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you, don't I?|Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.
Hey! Ready to go?|Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?|What are you doing? I said seven!  Argh!!!
Thanks!|Hey, you made it into a bunny.
What?|No, I can't.
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.|Yeah, exactly.
I didn't know you knew about that.|Well, I did and it hurt.  That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa|its Mike Hanagen
That was me.|Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that.
Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.|: Eww are you talking about my bother.
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.|Joey?
Ok|Yeah, come on in. Molly?
Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.|Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.|Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!|Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
Can you please, please take care of it for me?|Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.|And the destination?
Well, I might.|Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.
Bye.|Right.
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.|Oh! It's not good.
If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.|What?
Hi...|Is everything allright?
You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so…|Hey!
Yeah?|Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!
Incentive For Men?|So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?
Thanks!|Let's do it, come on!
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|Mom, dad, thanks for dinner.
Oh my God!|I'm a pretty little girl.
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?|Joey, it's a birthday party.
Incentive For Men?|Sure!
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?|I guess so...
So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!|Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!|Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|You do that every year??
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.|Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
It's in the cake, isn't it?|
Of course, I'd be honored!|Clearly we were wrong.
Previously on Friends...|I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?|I know.
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.|And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Oh, I like my job.|I *love* my job.
Uhh. You are welcome.|You know what? Let�s not talk.
You are going downer!|Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|You look beautiful.
Yeah.|Hello.� � Okay, "Bill from the bar."� I'll make sure she gets your number.
You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!|I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Hey.
What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?|Oh God. I'm so sorry.
Morning. Here you go.|Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.|You weren't there!
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.|Benji?
Yay.|Wait, what are you doing?
|Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
Hello?|Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Wow! This place is beautiful!|That... never happens...
|He stinks!
All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.|Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said...  There's no guy in there!
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.|Oh my God!
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.|Alright, okay.
Oh, oh. . What is this?|It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
I’m not gonna hit you.|Why not?  You’ll feel better!  I’ll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Hide my rings.
What do you really want to do?|Oh, hey...
Have you seen him throw a ball?|Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
No, it's not!|It's not?  When was she born?
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|"Then go, go!"
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Wow, it really is!
Two!|Two!
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.|That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.
I don't even know what that's for.|Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
There he goes, your fianc�e.|I guess so.
You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so…|Oh so there can’t be any yelling.
Chandler!|I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|YOU'RE FIRED!
A-And??|A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
Get out of the cab!|Get out of the cab!
Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?|Now, that you can do.
I don't want to look at your file! This is over.|Erica wait!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|wow. They must put a lot of makeup on you.
|So technically, would this person be in the wedding?
Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.|Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
Can I ask you a question?|Yeah.
Ok.|Hello, is this the creepy residence?
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
Arghhh! Double standards!|Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
Incentive For Men?|Oh.
Oh my God!|And?... AND?
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!|Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!|Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.|Rachel! Rachel!
Nighty-night!|Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
Hi!|Hey!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Let's forget about Ross...
Yeah...|Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.|Oh, sorry!
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
Your thoughts? Plural?|Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?|Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.
Rach, he just saw us.|Shhh.
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!|Let’s see.. to assure you get this directly, ring me back on my mobile.
You got it.|All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
I punched you...?|And...?
Do you hear something?|They're out there!
Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.|Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I|Well it depends.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Ok... so... Goodbye.
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!|It says “Do it!”. And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
ok I can't do this.|what's wrong?
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.|Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.|We're on our honeymoon.
You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so…|Shhh! We just got her to go to sleep
Is it?|Maybe not, is it?
Isn’t she beautiful?|Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.
Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped|I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!|Dude!
Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.|Hey!
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
I mean this is so great! We’re gonna be baby buddies!|Hi sweetie!
Hey, Charlie!|Hey.
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|Any room that isn't behind this couch!
Score.|Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?
I’m telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!|Which is of no interest to me, I’m a neurologist.
Stop saying good night.|Okay.
I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.|Oooh.� Girl's night out indeed.
Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!|You too.
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  "gay as the day is long"?|Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
It's just a little bit more, honey.|Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!
Here you go.|Shh! Nothing works with this child!
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.|Rachel! Rachel Green!
Yay.|Uhm, what was that?
What? What?|Rachel?
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Hey Amy.
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!|What are you doing here!
Sure?|Yeah, I mean whatever.
Oh . . .|Oh.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
That's shocking!|Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.|How was the pediatrician?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|You would do that? I never get picked!
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!|What are you doing?
Previously on Friends...|No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Ok!
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.|Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Well it stupid, unfair question!|Hey Ross. What's up bro?
Excuse me?|Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|What was Monica’s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|What?
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|Thank you.
M-Me-me-me!|You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
Jack, look at this.|Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!|Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...|Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Still me.
That’s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!|We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party.  All right, well, who cares, I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Hi you guys!
Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?|No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,|That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.|He saw a therapist?
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.|Oh, okay.
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.|Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
Alice would never go for it, right?|Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.|Seriously?
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.|Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!
I've been pretty good!|Thanks, you look good too.
Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?|Oh, well... Maybe we could...
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|Not it!
Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!|Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.|Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
Honey why don’t you go lie down.|Why’re you so tired?
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|It's David, actually!
Nighty-night!|Ok, ten.
Everything was delicious!|Actually I do have one small complaint.
Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.|Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
I said it's still nap time.|Hey!
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.|You're on!
Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom.|Well I’m peeking.  Oh my God!
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...|I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|What the hell are you doing?
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Uhm, "I have fur", "I like to bark".
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|We're still going at the game, right?
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|Sure.  You don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?
No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?|Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
Don't point your finger at me.|Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
What are you doing?|Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…
Hey.|Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
Yeah. What-what are you doing here?|Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
Oh my God!|Lying is wrong!
Well, I thought it first, Holmes.|Look, if you did...
Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...|Oh! Oh, no!
Thank you guys for having us over.|Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...!  Guess what happened at work today...
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Oh my God!
Wow, you're here already.|Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.|Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|...I really don't...
Phonetically?|Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call|RAT BASTARD!
So who are you?|Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
What about your massage client?|Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.|God bless you Chandler Bing!
Why, why would you open it?|Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!|Oh!
No, no, don’t get it. Let the machine pick up.|Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
Then what did happen?|Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"
That's not Monica!|Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Yeah, they're great seats too!
It's an unpaid internship.|It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .|It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring!|Congratulations! Wow!!
Yeah?|� Never mind.
See you guys.�|Rachel, lock the door.� Lock the door,� seriously.
... Phoebe...?|... and...?
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.|Okay.
this is my wife, Nancy.|Get Out!
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
And done!|Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around
Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."|You, touching yourself, out!
Oh . . .|I'm so glad you're back.�
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Sure, what.. what was the work thing?
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.|No.  wait a minute what was the little mermaid?
Okay!|Wow! You are really fast!
You might want to keep practicing.|Absolutely.� You'd do it for me.� Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..|I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Come, please come in. Come in.
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
But now she'll never know how he feels!|Yeah, that's true. Except I don't wanna get over her.
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.|Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
I don't even know what that's for.|Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|Oh my God! Oh my God that’s awful! What did you think of the house?
All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.|Hey!
Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night?  Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!|Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!
Just get out of here, okay?|What's - what's going on?
Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.|One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
Nighty-night!|Yeah, see you later!
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?|But you come first!
It�s been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table.|Maybe we should just eat now.
This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.|Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!|Oh, crap!
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|You ok?
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.|Ok, then maybe it'll be, uhm...
Wh-what's going on?|Ok professor or detective?
Joey's bare ass!|Ok.
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.|Wow.
Wh-what's going on?|Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.|Ok!
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?|Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.
Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.|I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Oh... okay, just hide!
Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.|Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
Ross!|Hi!
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?|Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.|Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.|Damnit!
Really?|Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.
No problem! Next week: stealing...|What? Something happened with the plates?
I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.|Obviously.
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.|Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
Previously on Friends...|I see.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Well who would?
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Ah. Thanks.|Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room.
Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?|A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
She has a lot of crap!|Hips or thighs?
I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.|Sure  Just not as much as clams.
I got it.|Thanks.
What are they?|They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|No, we weren't!
Thats not how you see me, is it?|There's your movie! <claps>
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!|But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?
Oh, thank you so much!|Yeah, and so funny!
Again, you're welcome.|You don't mind?  Well, what do you know, it fits!
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.|And?
Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.|Really? If that's what you want...
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!|Who is this?
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.|I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.
Isn’t she beautiful?|I know! I know it’s awful.
Hi!|Hi.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.
Hey! There you are!|Hey!
Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.|Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.|Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.
What?|Your last dance. Do it for us.
Hi honey I'm home!|: Hi, how was your flight?
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?|I’m sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff…
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|No...
That was a test and you just failed.|That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long...  It's not funny!!
Your age?|Chandler, that's great!
Bye, see ya.|So you're ruling out surrogacy?
I’m in the middle…|
I'm not supposed to tell you.|I'm not supposed to tell you!
Hey, here you go.|Yeah.
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?|Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?|Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
Yay.|There's nothing wrong with the plane.
I'll let you get acquainted.|So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
I don't even know what that's for.|It doesn't look good, does it?
Yeah.|You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
I'm there!|Bye.
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.|Sure, nice.
Hey.|Hey. I need to tell you something.
Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!|I can’t!
Thank you guys for having us over.|A dinosaur died a million years ago?
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
No... well, yeah.|I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hey hey! You dye your hair!|I'm a woman!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Not really. But you are much cuter then that geeky guy she used to date.
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.|I can see why, nice shirt!
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|You do?
It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?|I know what she's talking about.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hi.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Bring it on!
Yay.|What's going on?
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|No more falafel for you!
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".|Way!
Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.|Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.|Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.|Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Don't say that.
Ok, we're still on that.|Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.|Uch.
Previously on Friends...|I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law.  You're fun.|You need to fill out this form.
Nighty-night!|Hey!
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|But we love our house.
I need to say goodbye to the table first.|I understand.
Nighty-night!|Go! Go!
Bye.|Umm…that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
I understand...|I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.|Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.
Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.|No they ran out of "It’s a girl" but I can fix this one,  See?
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!|Try to understand!
Oh, Bob, get off the guy!|Oh! What a game, huh?
You still don't know my name, do you?|No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?|That I can do.
Phoebe did the signs!|See this is what I was afraid of, I didn’t think I should be here either but somebody  said he’d be over it by now.
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean .
Why are you here?|Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...
Barbados!|Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.|Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|What's the matter, Pheebs?
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.|I guess if everybody else is...
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!|What? How come that you don't have to go!
Hey!|Hey Pheebs.
Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...|Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui...
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|Sure!
Hey!|I - I don't take passengers.
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?|And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?|Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
Good job.|Really, can I hear some of it.
A friend-ship...|Twenty bucks.
Hey, hey!|Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.|Where's Emma?
|Who the hell was that?!
That’s great. I worry about little Ross. He’s always reading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs.|He’ll be fine.
|What do I smell?  I smell smoke. Huh�did you smoke?
So... now... What about with Mike's mom?|Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
… and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!|Okay…  You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age…
Jack, look at this.|I'm so confused!
Arghhh! Double standards!|Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Aw, he's gonna be so happy.
They have to learn!|Hey!
What are you guys doing?|We're taking a break!
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.
Madame, your passport please?|Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?|I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
Wow!|. Three hundred and fifty dollars?
Oh!|Monica. Calm, self.
Well, do you care about friendship?|Oh!
Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.|All right.� Well, I'll check the guest room.
It's never gonna happen again right?|Right! Never! Never! I swear!
|I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?
Oh, major shampoo explosion!|Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Correct. Rachel claims this is her favorite movie…
You won awards?|Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  I couldn't do it to Ross!|But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.|No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
Oh God!|No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry.  Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Ok!|I don't know.
That sounds like fun.|Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
Nighty-night!|I'm too excited!
Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?|No, we went to the left.
Okay, can you really tapdance?|No.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?|No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|You almost had me.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
Who's Nancy?|Ok, alright, you guys, you'd better sit down, this is pretty big.
Mhmm.|You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Emma, Ross wants you.
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.|Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
She's mine!|You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore.
Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.|What?
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.|Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
You got two more twos?|I'm an eight!
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.|Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?|Why?
I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.|So you're going to give me the baby?
Bye, see ya.|ah-ha!
OK.|So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.
What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.|Ooh... she backed out.
Chandler, sense the tone!!|Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!|I Know!
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they're gonna really hate me over there.
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.|You know, I really don't feel very comfortable making this decision. You know, Phoebe knows you better, I'm gonna let her choose.
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|Yes. Plus… what you've got that… I don't know what you've got going… this squirmy quality that you bring into the character that I couldn't've even imagined. Wow, hey, here's what we gonna do: come back tomorrow for the final callbacks with the ***, do all of this what you've got going now, but – you know what? – more, more. Can you do that?
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!|That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Jack, look at this.|You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
Hey!|I'll pull you through.
Can you?|And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
You know it's me?|For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
Can I adopt you?|I have a badge in it.
Hey, where have you been?|What?
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.|How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
What?|There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.|Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.
Isn’t she beautiful?|That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
No, no, no!|No, no!
I love you.|I love you guys.
So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?|Hey Joey.  Hey you.
Isn’t she beautiful?|She said yes.
I don’t think so.|Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!|Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
owwwww...|Please don't take her away from me!
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?|You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.|I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?|No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Thank you.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|What, is everything ok?
I'm still looking through mine...|And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
Y’know, I don’t really know her.|Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?|No, did we miss it?
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|No, no, no!  Don't drop by, don't drop by!
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.|Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Thanks for coming you guys.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Hi...
Really? That hadn't occurred to me.|They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?|Oh, that's it?  A great idea! Oh yeah.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.
Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.|You mean, when you were a baby.
Hey, for what it’s worth, with Rachel I don’t think you’ll ever be just  "anybody."|Hey there you go!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.
Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?|Sure, yeah!
Yeah, Monica made us!|Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.
I did!|
Then what did happen?|No, I didn’t!
I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.|Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!|Yeah!
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?|I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.
Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.|Too little, too late, Benji!
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means...|Chandler?
: he has to work, there's some rush on the big  ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.|oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
No!|Come on!
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second!  So what's new?
Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!|You may want to lose the foam finger!
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Uh, yeah I think I did.
Dad, what are you doing?|Wanna peek?
I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two  are on your own.|Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.
I'm still looking through mine...|Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
Do you have any ideas?|Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.|I wanna say it's not looking good.
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?|I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|No! What are you going to do? Make me?
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?|Oh my God! Did you talk to him?
Chandler gets pedicures!|So, do you get colours or just French tips?
What? Who says that?|People who’ve never ever been to Paris.
I understand...|Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
Oh my God, what's it doing here?|Uh! What a pickle.
Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart.|You blow me away.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|I do pilates.
I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.|You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!|Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I'll do it. Gimme!
Why, you don't like her?|Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Yeah.|Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.|What?
I'm out of here|Good night!
Oh.|I hate my parents.
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.|I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!|I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he's my favourite author!
Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?|You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|So you wanna buy a house in the 50's?
That was me.|No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.
Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.|Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|Hey, did you get the turkey bast-Oh my God! Oh my God!  Who is that?
A friend-ship...|Wow! You blow my mind...
We've been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.|I have such fat hands!
Serve the ball, chump!|Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.|I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?|Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Why can't you ever be supportive?
You don’t have to worry about that okay?|Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.
Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?|Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
Hey!|Hey!
Honey why don’t you go lie down.|Hi!
Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!|Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.|Hi!
I understand...|You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Chandler Bing.
Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?|No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.  I’ll get out of it.
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?|
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Nooooo, why?
Jack, look at this.|No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter’s birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.|Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?
Of course, I'd be honored!|So excited about your letter!
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|Can I talk to you alone for a minute?
Hey hey, can I help?|Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Who is it?|Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!|So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
What happened?|Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.
Hey!|Hey!
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.|So, I guess this is it.
Hey, hey!|Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know… sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I…
Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?|No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
Thank you guys for having us over.|I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!|I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. That’s how I got my bad hip.
Okay. Here goes.|What's the matter?
She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?|Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Previously on Friends...|Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.|Well, let's just go in there and face them.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!|Please, come in.
I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.|Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|Uhm... oh... I don't know, it's too hard.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Yeah?
Well, this is very generous!|Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?|Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa|I'm sorry I didn't catch.
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.|Actually its not pies, its just pie.
Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.|And we're out!
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|That's so sweet.
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.|Okay, guys, wish me luck.
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|And about an hour ago, we made an offer.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
NO, NO, NOOO!|Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?|Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
Well, the club lost it's power.|Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore. I mean you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting. This could be the simple wedding you've always wanted!
Yeah.|Oh, so everything's okay?
We weren’t picking up, it’s Amanda!|I get pedicures!
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!|!
Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?|Are you still here?
Isn’t she beautiful?|Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand…
Jack, look at this.|Was that Emma? Is she up?
No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?|No, I'm okay.
Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!|Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!|I'll play ya!
Well, the club lost it's power.|Wow, you know, it's so beautiful out there. You always wanted to get married outside. Why don't you guys just do it on the street?
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!|Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Yeah, I'm sure.
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?
What do you really want to do?|Ahh...
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Ross, what are you talking about?  oh! Oh my God! They put my baby’s face on a penis!
Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.|So you're gonna be gone four days a week?  No.
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?|You are to me...
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?|Are all the questions this personal?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Now listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything cause you know you'd be dead. I was thinking about changing her name. I'm just not really a big fan of Emily. [Transcriber note: I'm surprised that Rachel and Ross didn't say they weren't either here]
I do.� I do.� Although, it's actually a lager.|huh.� � What's the difference between beer and lager?
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
You really did that?|Yep.
We’re seriously asking for our money back?|Oh my God, I love your shirt!
Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.|Oh, so we didn't win, but it's fun to play the game, right?
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Oh my god...
That sounds like fun.|You pierced her ears!?
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.|I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
Yeah!|So what did you two do about it?
What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!|Ooh...I hear that's bad.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!|Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.|Hey, what did you guys do today?
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Hey.
Hi!|I want you to meet someone really special. Phoebe, this is Erica. And this is the baby!
Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.|Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty!|Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
This room’s available.|Uh Rach…
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?|Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!
Oh, crap!|Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller
Well, well, they're good.� It's been a while since I've seen you like this.� You, you clean up good.|Oh well, well thank you.�
I am scrappy.|Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!|Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...|So this is an annual thing?
What about your massage client?|I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.|Oh, well, it's a shame that you-that you miss the movie 'cause we were gonna see, you know, either "Liar, Liar" or "Betrayal", or... "An Affair To Remember".
That was a test and you just failed.|Who cares? Nobody reads those things
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|I think we've found our sperm!
Ehm... Her name is Emma.|Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.|Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
Phoebe did the signs!|Hey so where’s Ross?
Alright fine. I'll do it.|Good.
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.|: what's the big deal, you forgot, she forgot, maybe you were having an off night
Hey!|Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?|That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that.
Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?|Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
Well, then who was on my bed?|
Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.|Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.|In the closet.
Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.|Yeah.
Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!|No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
Ha! My point!|Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you I’ll go straight to my forty two point plan.|Walter .
We're just making conversation.|You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness
No|you look great.
What is it? Hey!|Really it’s nothing. I’m just…
Thanks so much for showing me around.|Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Wow! That was amazing!|Amazing... amazing.
Hey!|You're ready?
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.|Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Oak, maple, elm, birch...
I know!  Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!|Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.|Hey Pheebs...
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Stop!
Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?|Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.|No! Nothing with a raccoon.
Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...|Well... hey, the key works...!
What? What do you mean you know?|Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.|Would you like a lollypop?
Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.|I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
|No, but Chandler, hello... Aren't you scared of dogs?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|And, a lemon lime.
Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.|Joey said that you're in here with another man.
Uh, where do you think you're going?|I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
Oh, hey Joey.|Uh, hey.
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.|Oh.. My sister's raccoon.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!|Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait?
Make the transfer!|Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.|It's ok. Ho-honest mistake.
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.|Hmm mmmhm..
With the circus? He's behind the elephant.|Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?
That'll work!|I don't think so.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Really?
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|Call us when you get there.
No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.|What?
You didn't like that?|.
Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?|Maybe...
Hi!|Oh my God!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Oh.
OK!|She gets crazy! This scar  is from Pictionary!
Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.|And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot
I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.|Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?|They are awfully boxy...
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like...
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.|There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.|Really? That's great!
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.
Hi.|Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|Oh, I don’t think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
Okay.  Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...|Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!
Oh thank you so much.|Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
Yeah.|Yeah!
Okay.|Okay.
You're mean!|Oh, don't be such a baby!
Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.|Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
I know.|Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?
Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!|Oh... I'm back!
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|When I was growing up, I didn't have a normal mom and dad, or a regular family like everybody else, and I always knew that something was missing. But now I'm standing here today, knowing that I have everything I'm ever gonna need... You are my family.
Ken, please! No, I can�t, I can�t smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.|I�m sorry, but isn�t your wife back in New York?
Alright. My job here is done.|That was... Impressive.
I'll tell you at the wedding.|The blizzard. I just saw on the news, it's like the worst snow storm in 20 years! They already closed all the bridges and tunnels.
Nice to meet you.|Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!
Who's that?|What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
Then what did happen?|Yeah, what did happen?
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.|Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Oh, I don't wanna choose! It's . Oh okay, wait. Rach! Listen I have a very special bridesmaid task for you today.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!|I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head inside a turkey's ass!
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Hey. How did you sleep?
It was great.|Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
It's just a little bit more, honey.|The baby's head is crowning.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Oh, I know, I know. I've just been crazed.
Oh good, I hate it when you do that|And lots of kissing your neck.
I understand...|Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
Nighty-night!|Hello?
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Dude, two times that happened!
All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica|Can you totally see through her shirt ?
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Happy birthday!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh my god. You're on Days of Our Lives.
Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!|Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let’s go!
No I don’t.|A little bit.
Do you not know each other?|Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|"I could go right now."
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!|And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Interesting.|I guess!
But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!|You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.|The burping clogs?
I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.|Why?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Thats a great movie. <she claps>
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.|Okay. Excuse me...
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Yeah he's lying. He looked down.
Okay.|Uhm, did you guys know that there is a giant ice sculpture in the hall?
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.|Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
I understand...|No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
Really?|Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.
Previously on Friends...|Joey...
Barbados!|No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
Are you all right?|Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
Hey, hey!|You're mother killed herself!
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?|It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
Yeah!|Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|Hey!
All right.� I'll do it.� � But really, how much dirtier can it get?|Oh, Mike.� Bye.
I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...|Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
Oh, I hear divorce bells.|What?
I hope Ross isn't too upset.|I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Big fat goalie.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
Do you have to go?|Really?
Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t think you’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh?|Really?
yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-�-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.|Vicrum?
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon…
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.|Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Nighty-night!|Come on robot!
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.|So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!|AAAHHHH!
I lent them to Ross.|WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
Alright-y then.|'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|What did I just say?
I'd love to stay, but I have eh...|Please... go!  Just let me know if you need a hand!
So, you’re not going to Paris.|No, I’m still going.
Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!|Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...|Later! La...
|Michael!
Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone.|Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Okay.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.
Honey why don’t you go lie down.|You know what you should’ve done, you should have told yourself that little story.
You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so…|What!?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh she's precious. Do you ever worry she's going to get your real nose?
No it's not!|Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Incentive For Men?|Oh, I get it!
Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.|What do you mean?
Oh, I like my job.|Thanks.  I'll see you New Year's Day.
What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.|You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.|Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but I’ll run out and get some more.
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.|What?
Wow!|Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!|I knew you'd be here!
No, that seems about right.|Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer...  Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!|You are!  Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.|No, I didn't.
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.|Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!
Ross...|Six? You want me to join you?
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?|I was not!
I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.|Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.|: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!|Hey!
Which one is which again?|Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
What, Rach?|I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Oh Amy, you remember Ross.
Well, I�ll tell you what we�re gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe�s birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we�re gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.|Fine. What!?
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!|But you are a liar.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh. That's a funny noise.
Rachel, this is yours.|Aah! Why? What are these for?
Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.|Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumé.
Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?|No more so than acting.
I lent them to Ross.|PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|That is so sweet. I love you.
Estrangement .|Good evening, Miss.  Miss!
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.|Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?|Dr. Drake Remoray.
If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.|Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.|I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|I forgot my bat.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...|
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...|Go, go, go!!
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.|Well...
Thanks for coming.|
Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they|Uh, clearly.
Ok, hey Rach?|Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
Arghhh! Double standards!|But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|I decorated Dad's office.
Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say "neither".|Oh God, neither!
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.|Ehh.
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...|Joey.
We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...|Oh, that is so tacky.
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|What?
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.|Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
Oh, come on Ross...|No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
Do you have to go?|I can't believe you guys are moving.
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.|Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.
Hi.|Hi.
You mean like this?|NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.|Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|I can't believe this is gonna end. I guess I'll have my stuff packed up.
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.|We're gonna see each other naked.
|You know, Chappy's too small to handle all this snow. Someone's gonna have to walk him down the aisle.
Ok, we're still on that.|You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|Ok, would you care for my seat as well?
Enjoy!|What did they say?
Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!|That’s not even a word!
No, you didn’t!|Okay.
Seriously?|Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.|Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.
Yeah.|A-a-and... record.
Your ex-boyfriend?|Yeah.
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.|Chandler!
Hey!|Hey!
No, you�re right. Mnya, we shouldn�t do it like this. Huch. For what it�s worth, I�m, I�m sorry. I shouldn�t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.|Mean it?
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.
Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?|Sure.
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...|Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying...  Stop lying!
Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.|My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|So you’re gonna... hit on her?
Oh!|Oh..
Okay. And uh, are you married.|No.
Yeah...|You are married though.
Hey, I need your help.|Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
Thank you guys for having us over.|Ooh, Italian!
These aren't suede.|No.
So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.|Who?
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.|One of the slots got filled.
I don't know.� Do I have to decide right now?|Well, you kind of just did.� That guy is going to call you tonight.� Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
I lent them to Ross.|Are you serious?
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Oh, yeah, that's true.|Uh, I haven't.
Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re talking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf.|I get it!
I'm so sorry...|Is-is he ok?
If you want to check your email, just ask!|It's not the time Charlie.
Hey!|Alright, well, this does not change anything.  Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|Oh, I’m sorry. I meant no.
No, I don't think so.|Yeah. Mine too.
Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.|That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.|GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.|And you fixed the Philange?
Wher-where have you been?|I suppose that Monica will have the � manipulative shrew.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?|Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Interesting!  Can I see you for a second?
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?|Well I've got a book around...
I'm not always that bad!|Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about|Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.|Those are my shoes.
Yes.|This is your current cellphone?
Yep!|Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Nighty-night!|Yeah!! Let's do that!
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring!|OH!
Mmh... this cake is amazing!|My God, get a room!
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Sure.
Hey, hey!|Okay…
She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.|Hey! I sold that to Joey.
Oh.|Ooh, who's it for?
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!|Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Hey! Happy birthday ...
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.|Can I get you another glass of wine?
Nice to meet you.|N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
To kill Bob??|No, no, to test his neck strength.
NO!|Hey! Hey Adrienne.
Oh, you did it!|Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?
Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .|Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
Previously on Friends...|My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
I'm sorry!  This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!|It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!|Does that sound like Janice?
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
Phoebe did the signs!|That’s not fair! I can’t do that.
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?|
What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...|What?
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|"Oh, you sick bastard!"
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|What do you mean "what do we do"?
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.
Yeah, where were you!|You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|I don't care... I'll be my something blue.
Hey you guys.|Hi!
Wow. She does that a lot!|Ross, you didn�t tell me you were a doctor!
After all, my parents died very young.|And my cholesterol’s off the charts!
I know, I still need to talk to you.|To see if know what these guys are talking about.
oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.|that's why she was weird.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Do you have a hair straightener?
Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...|And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a  HI!
You guys, we�ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.|Why would you do that?
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.|: Joey, Joey.
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?|
Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!|On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
Wow!� � Wow, You look . . . uh . . .�� It's just, ah . . .�� That dress . . . uh . . .�|Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.|I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|"Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"
Hi.|Hey.
Sure.|Great!
Thats not how you see me, is it?|Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?
Either of you girls got a quarter?|Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...|Santa!
That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.|Huh. What's Tag's last name?
Well...  no.|Do you wanna get a drink?
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Aw.
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|No, sorry sweety..
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.|Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.|Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!|Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.|We can't afford that.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|Alright, but after this I want to see you outside. If the rain stops.
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.|A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?|Check again please!
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that|Mon', not that you didn�t sound good, but...
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.|But you said he was this great guy!
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..|Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...
Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...|Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!|No! Come on let’s—One more time! One final push! Ready? 1…2…3!
|It was really... great!
Yeah, where were you!|Let me see this...  Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.|Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
Guys!?|Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!|Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth
Nighty-night!|No, lets just draw straws.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
I'll tell you at the wedding.|How's it going?
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.|It's great! How?
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!|Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".|Wow. What does that mean?
Jack, look at this.|Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
We need to talk to you about something.|Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.|All right, here it goes...
Again, you're welcome.|I really mean it.
Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.|Good plan.
I lent them to Ross.|Man, I've got food all over me.
Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.|You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.|Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it  OH SALT BLOATY!
|Did you watch the tape?
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Yeah.
Hey Joe!|What's up?
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.|What?
well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so.  You kissed me.|uh huh
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.|Oh my God! What did you say?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Ooh! Calm down ...
Oh... Okay, sorry!|Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?|But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
Oh, look at her, so happy!|All right...
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!|Yeah, I mean, if you moved there, you have to leave here. I mean, how can you leave this place?
Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?|No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
Oh my God, it's all so elegant! When's the dirty stuff starting?|What?
It's ok that's how you feel.|But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
uh uh!|Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.|Ugh.
Yeah...|Hey!
Eye-contact?|Mm-hmm.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Okay.
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|God how long do you think that’s gonna last?
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.|That's a... pla-an.
Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.|I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Honey why don’t you go lie down.|Hi, welcome home!
So... now... What about with Mike's mom?|She said WHAT?
this is my wife, Nancy.|Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
Do you even know what a banana hammock is?|It's a funny word.
What are you guys doing?|Are, are you kidding? This is packing?
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!|Oh, good!Ok, good for you!Try to recapture the magic!
I don’t believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?|Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...|I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Ah, yeah!|Do you?
No problem! Next week: stealing...|Ben Weiss
Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.|Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
Again, you're welcome.|See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ...
Yay!|Umm, okay. If it’s a boy it’s Daniel.
Congratulatioooons!|It's too late for apologies.
Here she is!|Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me.  I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.
Everything was delicious!|Thank you! You haven't said anything...
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.|She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are...
You still don't know my name, do you?|No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really.|Yeah! But you said not to worry about...
I think you know.|I'm sorry... we... we can't.
Yes, but we have to be fast.|Okay, I'll try.
Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.|Oh my God!
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|Yeah...
Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.|Oh, really?
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|That's just good sense!
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.|The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.|: Honey why don't you just let it go and ask her out again.
Like a month?|Or a year?
Alright!|But ehm...what is it not?
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!|It worked!
Okay, now. What?|And...Action!!
Previously on Friends...|I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.|Hey
Well, actually it...|No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.|Wait, did you know it was twins?
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...|What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...
No, not if their room has two beds!|moonlight boat ride!!
Oh, she’s so beautiful.|Y’know what I mean! She’s this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and…uh-oh.
It's a... It's a boy!|Wow!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm.
Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!|Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|Ok, ok!
Hello.  I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.|What?
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?|Hey!
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?|Good to see you.
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.|Hey guys!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.|No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright...  Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!|Robert Carlock
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|We don�t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct �
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?|Yeah, I'm sure.
It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!|There you go! Someone came!
Hey.|Heeeeey, where have you been?  What happened to you?
Hey, I need a ticket.|Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
Hi|Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Thats not how you see me, is it?|Sure, Monica would have to give her up.
Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!|If I haven't said so already sir,  congratulations!
I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?|Hey dude, what's up?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh. I was so looking forward to this. It was going to be such a beautiful Thanksgiving. We were going to have sushi.
Thank you guys for having us over.|No one wanted seconds, right?
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.|I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!|You can see where he'd have trouble.
Hey, hey!|What?
Which technically now you should give back!|You told him he's adopted?
So, did you err... did you tell Ross?|Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!|Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|Diary.
Aw � what?|Mom�s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.
|Hey! You made it. Great! Chappy! Hi!  Mom, I know getting married in the street isn't something you approve of...
Good for you. That was really mature.|What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Congratulations!
Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.|Is he really?
What?|I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't gonna happen.
I'm still looking through mine...|Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Does Ross know?
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.|Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?|City Hall.
OH MY GOD!|You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|What's wrong?
Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.|Whoo!
Yeah! I'll cook!|Yeah! Let's go out.
Uhuh.|I'm on the phone!
Hi.|Ok.
Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?|Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
Yeah.|Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.|Oh.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!
What about your massage client?|Wo-ish.
I'm still looking through mine...|You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.|But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I'm so sorry...|Ohh...
Miss?|Rachel?
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?|Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.|Nice to meet you.
Wow!|Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! .
Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...|I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
One? How about a whole bunch?|Really?
Nana liked it rough!|Hey!
Well, it needs to be plicit.|All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
Yeah.|She even reads for pleasure!
Tell me who it is.|Joey!
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!
C'mon guys, it'll be fun!|All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
I didn't.|Oh really?
Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.|Hey sweetie.
Ah, it's been so long, so long.  I can't believe you're still doing this!|Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.|Bye.
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!|Yeah, I'm out.
What are they?|I give you $ 500 for them!
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|What do you know about love?
Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?|Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
Hey, how was class?|No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?
Hi honey!|Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
That's insane!|Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Dr. Wiener.|Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Come on!!
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?
Oh!|I feel terrible.
Seriously?|"I'm a little bit country"...
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.
Ok!|And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
I know.|I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?|I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.
Oh, ok, thank you.  Do you see what all the guys see in her?|Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
Yeah.|You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.|So...
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.|Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....
Hey!|It should be right next to my plane ticket.
A little more, a little more.  A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.|All right, ready?
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...|Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
You won awards?|Oh, you are the lesser of two evils!
Here you are|Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
Really?|Really?
I know, and with the baby coming?|So, should we tell her?
So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!|Oh, well...
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.|That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.
I do too.|This is huge!
Nighty-night!|Good job Alan!
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin!|No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
Of course, I'd be honored!|Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.
Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.|Just subtract twelve.
Ooh, I want one...|There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
We’re seriously asking for our money back?|Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don’t think that that’s ever happened before.
You can’t marry him!|Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?|Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.|Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Forgotten.
That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.|Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
Barbados!|Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, "island's stuff".
I don’t know. What do you think?|I think we should.
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.|Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?
Good job.|Hey Joey.
Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?|I’d have to say…the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you’re making me eat him.
Hell, yeah!|Wanna make it more interesting?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Yes, Joe?
I said it's still nap time.|Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
I'm sorry too...|ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Hey Mikey|Hey P
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.|Oh!
Yeah, wow.|Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Sorry about the table, man.
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?|Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Both it is, thank you.|I�ll just wait to put your order in.
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!|Growth!
I know!|And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
Yay.|Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
|But, those are for you.
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.|Dude, chill!  Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?|Yeah.
Ross, say something. Anything.|And have you .. ed?
Can I adopt you?|I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.|Don’t take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
Previously on Friends.|Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
Well it stupid, unfair question!|Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...|Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.|I got them!
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.|Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Be-caaauuuse...|All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh."|Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
Ja!|You know I...
What? They will be!|Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she’s gonna go nuts for you.
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.|Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. .|What is that?
Me too. I'm good at it.|All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
No, hey, it's been great.|Yeah?
So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!|Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.
Yeah, right Monica.� I'm so sorry.|Ah, it's an honest mistake.� It could happen to anyone.� All right, see ya.
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Can I adopt you?|Yeah.
Why... I... I don't know.  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?|hmmm...
Thank you.|Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Twins actually run in my family.
You're not making the pies yourself?|No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
Yeah, I did.|. You are SO going to Heaven!
No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.|Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
Okay, my turn. My turn.  I won’t.|What’s the matter now?
Can�t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.|Oh my god, I left the water running.
I can't imagine what he sees in her.|We were just chit-chatting. How's your friend?
Hey, here you go.|No, I don't think it ever works. Why?
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!|You're not good!
We need to talk to you about something.|She's putting words in your mouth!
Can I adopt you?|You do? That's fantastic!
Oh!|How does this look?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Amy! <pause> Yes I do.. I really do. <grabs Ross' hand for support>
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|What? Why?
He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?|Oh, I’m fine.
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin!|
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!|Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
Work, Joe!|What am I gonna do now?
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?|See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Ah actually we don’t.|Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I didn’t even do anything wrong.
Wher-where have you been?|I would never lie to get someone into bed.
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?|Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.|Hey.
Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.  What’s the matter?|Nothing.
Okay, that helps.|Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too!  Alright, eight.
I�m starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.|Soo, are we expecting the rest of our party shortly?
What? They will be!|Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I’m... I’m gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
What? What?|Yeah?
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!|Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ...
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.|So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|Just so I know, if I had asked first...
Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.|No I told you I can't.
Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!|Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
Oh... uh... look... before you...|No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
I guess, in time.|Yeah.
Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not  Phoebe...|Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
Ow!|Who are you?
I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.|Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?|The next baby should be along in a minute.
Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.|So, how dark is it gonna get?
I'll let you get acquainted.|You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom.|
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.|Well, you got uhm... good energy.
I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...|You have to tell David!
Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.|I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!|You know what? It's not your decision anymore.
Isn’t she beautiful?|If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!
What?|Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?|Yeah!
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.|Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
This doesn't concern you!!|Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!|You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.|Oof...
Dessert?|Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|YE-AH!
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.|He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
That's because he's on your neck.|Well...  Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
What?|Something personal.
Yeah.|Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|and that's a girl.
What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!|I'm gonna do this now.
Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!|I'm sorry...
Yeah...|Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
Yeah.|Hi!
Hey!|A little late for that.
Hey!|Hey!
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Oh!
I'm there!|We'll see you, guys!
Hey, here you go.|Who do you wanna fool around with?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
Uh, actually, that's..|Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;|Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.|Hey!
Good night.|Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?|Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
Oh! Emma might like what?|Um, my present!
Hey, hey!|Okay, I think we have a problem here.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Yes you did, gleba is a word!
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.|But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.|She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Yeah.
What? What?|I... I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you. I love you.
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!|Saraaah.
I'll tell you at the wedding.|About what?
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?|N-it wasn�t easy, but it�s your birthday and I did what I got to do.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey.
Ok, we're still on that.|I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!|I'll show you how.
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?|...No...
I thought so.|What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?|Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.|"Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want."
Ross...|Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this...|Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
Honey.|Yea yea.
We have to leave!!|Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!|Oh my god, you're right!
But what?|This is kind of a classy place.
Hi!|Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
I just had a rough night.|Oh. Crab cake?
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?|I uhm... Well, I sang...
Oh, she’s so beautiful.|Oh my God! She’s amazing. Oh, oh I’m so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
Incentive For Men?|Sure!
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.|Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
Oh, look at her, so happy!|Well, look, whatever happens, we’re here for you and we love you.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Hey, you guys... I have great news.
Hey, hey!|Wonderwoman!
Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?|Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.
A friend-ship...|Aaahh... How much do I owe you?
Okay|This is your cellphone?
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...|I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.
Oh, I like my job.|Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.
Hey.|Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
I'm so sorry...|Still-still, let me come... for me.
Here.|And now your cell.
There's no seatbelt!|That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
Okay, well the ??? is not home.|No. Uch.
Oh man.|I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!|I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
this is my wife, Nancy.|Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.|Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.
Ok, hey Rach?|I hope I win!
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|ooh oooh..
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|See you guys later.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.|Dude, you're not tanned.
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.|Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|A rock, a dog, the earth.
It doesn’t happen to me either.|Me neither.
Uh-huh.|So, who does?
And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!|Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Amy.
I thought so.|And listen to this...
Nana liked it rough!|Come on here, have a seat.
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".|No way!
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.|I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.|You’re right, you’re right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|Oh my God.  Hello?
Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!|See, I told you!
Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.|It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
AH YEAAAAH!|I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?|Yeah...
What?|I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
NO! I don't!!|Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
Oh man.|Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
: how do you know I have one of those?|HA!
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Yeah.
Previously on Friends...|Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!|What?
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.|What? Whoo... What?
Really?|No you did.
Yeah.|Hey!
Who's Nancy?|What?
Let's celebrate with some maple candy!|No!
Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?|Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.|OK, Pheebs, your turn.
Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?|Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??|Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! .
We’re seriously asking for our money back?|It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.|What about my children Drake?! Huh!?  No!! No!! No! God!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Check your numbers! Make me rich!
Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.|Yeah, it's fun .
Oh. Ah-uh.|A widower.
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION!
But Chandler lent you money!|And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.|Well, hey! Well...  To Phoebe and Mike!
It's really gone?|I just feel awful.
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!
Oh my God, are you okay?|I recently had surgery.
Scary pigeon's back?|It's huge.
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|Hi.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Fancy.
Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.|Ok!
Yeah, where were you!|Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?|We have to stop them before something happens!
Alright, I'll be right back.|Where are you going?
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.|Female body inspector? What size is that?
Hey buddy.|Uh, hi.
In Minsk...|Yeah?
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.|Uh, we're gonna be great.
Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?|I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.
Oh, because, um . . .� well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple of days.� So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.|Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.|Oh, great!
How many kids were we gonna have?|Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Hey.
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
So . . .� Welcome.|I got beer.
You guys, we�ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.|Chandler, control your woman!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Sure, you want to go upstairs?
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|So that was the baby's room. (They come out and Chandler throws Joey behind
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|Oh my god.
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.|: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!
Hi.|So you're up for keynote speaker! Who's making the decisions?
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Dangerous Liaisons.
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?|You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the
Morning, roomie!|Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.|The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
She did WHAT?|BE-LOW me!
O-oh my God!|What?
Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.|Yeah.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Oh, oh, oh... What a dog says.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Jill?
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|Okay, well, stop staring at them.
Ahhh!|Let me finish ...
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|Umm let me think...What do I want, what d-o I w-a-n-t...
Arghhh! Double standards!|You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
Oh, it was so much fun.� It felt so good to be out.|Uh, Rach.
What's going on?|: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.|Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.|By you!?
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.|"I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo."
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?|Yeah.
I think you should take the job.|Really?
What did I just say?|You still here?
Chandler gets pedicures!|Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?|Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.|I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!|Ok!
I understand...|What?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.
Ross, where are you going?|To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
You're kidding right?|Nope.
|Hey!
your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get you anything?|do you have any cake?
|Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Arghhh! Double standards!|Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
Arghhh! Double standards!|Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
What?|Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.|I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.
The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.|Mmm-mm.
You're fly is open, Geller!|Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!
It's a Speedo.|...Oh crap!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|mh hmm..
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Well actually...
But we don't do that.|I know, I just thought it would be fun.
So, do you have any other question about advertising?|No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
I'm gonna get the lasagna.|Yeah!
Chandler gets pedicures!|Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.
Good night!|Seriously, good night!
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.|Yeah, you got to get to the hospital.
Joe I’m not kidding…|Hit me, hit me.
Arghhh! Double standards!|No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.|Tonight?!  Oh, there it is!
Money!  Friends...|Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
Well it stupid, unfair question!|Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.|You do attract some stinkers.
Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.|Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Oh, you're so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?|Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|Well, I hope you're happy!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
Uh-huh!|Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Of course, I'd be honored!|I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
Okay...|Hi... I'm Sandy.
Yeah, we met in college.  I mean, high school.|Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.|Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|Is this because I come over here without knocking and eat your food?  I really, really think I can!
Yeah!|Without that, you just got "lame with women".
No.|What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
Ah, Claudia, aren�t you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses� ass?|I�m sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in|Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
That�s right, because I forbid you to smoke again.|You forbid me?
It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...|Oh... what an interesting name.
Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5…4…|3-2-1 oh!!
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Anybody tell you?
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Enunciate!
You were my first kiss with Rachel?|You were my first kiss ever?
Yay.|What's wrong with the plane?
You won awards?|Well, Chandler said that it's really important to him too!
Alright, who wants to do it?|Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.|You should go.
She did WHAT?|Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
Of course, I'd be honored!|Thanks!
Alright, so that leaves Chandler.|Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
Damn super cuts!|what's up is Phoebe ok?
But now she'll never know how he feels!|Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get over her.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Wow, this is quite a spread!  What is all this stuff?
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!|Are you wearing two belts?
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|NOW look what you did!!
Bet she'd sleep with you now...|No... I already e-mailed her.
Oh, Ja! Ja!|Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?|Answer faster, answer faster!
I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.|Ross, nice to meet you.
Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?  Aunt Margaret's pants size?|I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
No... no...|I mean...
Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!|Ok, ok, here we go.
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.|"I do".
Hey, here you go.|In the hall.
You didn't like that?|Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|There's something new in the bowl.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|Yes!
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they’ll copy it in icing!
Oh God.� Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?|Oh God.� It seems like forever ago.
I am sooo drunk.|That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
Well  I’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.|Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
What, what.|Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine
So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?|I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?|
Hey, hey!|Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone…  … when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: "Gimme your money, punk!"
Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!|Well, there's two spots left right?
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|Ouchy.
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|Ready? "What the hell are you still doing here?"
I understand...|Why not?
What... what you working on?|Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|Get out!
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?|I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|And it's out of my system!
Yay!|It’s clearly an Emma.
No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!|And she wants to go hunting, too!!
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?|Hey guys!
Well, the club lost it's power.|Me too!  Monica, do you think we could do it?
Do you have any ideas?|Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible.  That's right, I know some stuff!
Again, you're welcome.|Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
So, you just let her go?|Yeah.
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!|Are you talking about me?
You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.|Oh, how cute!
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.|Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|Oh my God.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?|Oh yeah!
Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!|*Now* it feels like Christmas.
.and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.|But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross
You tricked me to get me into bed?|That�s right, I got mine.
Man... I... I'm sorry.|Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
Ooh...|What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.
Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.|Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.|Look who's coming around!
Can I adopt you?|I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
Estrangement .|If you ask me to stay, I�ll pee.
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?|Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!
|Heeeeeey!
Nothing, I really wanna know.|Oh…  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene…
Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!|Are you really that busy?
I hate my friends.  Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.|Like what?
So you forfeit?|Mike wins?
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!|Hey, what are you guys doing?
Yeah! You bet roomy!|Don't you mean..groomy?
Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?|Oh, they�re both exclus�
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|And a baby...
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Yeah.
That’s it. That’s it.|Mine haven’t been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now.  Oh, that was a big one!
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?|Yeah, so?
You are not at Thanksgiving?|No...
No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.|What?
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.|Hey! So what show are you on?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
Yeah!|So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|Wanna get out of here?
I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.|Oh.
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!|I don't know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened. Where - where is my coat?!
Wow, that is tempting.|Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?|Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.
Oh, DAMN IT!|And, of course, if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you can always adopt.
Phoebe did the signs!|Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.|You even have to ask?!  He is alive!
Yes, but we have to be fast.|Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Ugh.
Hey, here you go.|You can't!
Well, this is very generous!|Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
Hey!|Hi!
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|I will. Ross, come here.
I understand...|Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Yeah.
Ah, so glad you decided to come.|Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?|She doesn't know what to say!
Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...|Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.|But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?|No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Gladys?|Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
Miss?|I'm so sorry.
What?!|A year?!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Why does she keep making that noise?
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|Hi Mike!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Nothing...
Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!|Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!
Hi!|Hey!
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Pizza toppings, next!
Hey you guys.�|Hey.
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?|I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|That's so cool.� I'll let Monica know.
Previously on Friends.|Oh my God!
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Absolutely.
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.|I can’t say that I’m surprised.
Oh shoot.� I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.� � Wait, wait.� Sorry.� Did he call?� Did that guy call?|No.� Just his mom.
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.|And a lot could still get in our way.
Where did you go to do it?|Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.|So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
I said it's still nap time.|When they see this you'll be 52!
What?|Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!|Yes, I was looking for Monica.
Ross, say something. Anything.|No, no, no!
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.|Okay...
Oh God, Ross.� Ross is going to pick up the phone.� Oh, I have to get my number back.� � Oh my God.� He's gone.|Dead on.
No, what's he like?|Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Oh my God!
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|Please, you don't have to explain. I mean, perhaps if I hadn't gone to Minsk things would have worked out for us. And I wouldn't have ruined my career, or lost that toe to frostbite. It was a good trip!
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.|I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.|Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.|Finish it!
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?|Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
How do you know?|Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!|
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.|Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
Original.|No, sorry haven't seen him.
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!|How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
Wow! This place is beautiful!|I've been following your career for years, I-I can't wait for your keynote speech.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Girls Chandler could never get?
Jack, look at this.|Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!|Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.|Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.|Joey, wait! The ball!
Calm ourselves?|Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
Joey's bare ass!|All right. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|Okay Buckwheat!
You must think I'm crazy.|No, I think you're sweet.
Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?|You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...|No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
Previously on Friends...|Ooh, what's going on?
Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...|Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...
Hi|Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
I'm the hell person whose office this is!|I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.
Hey!|Here, let me help you.
Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.|What? You do? You do?  Oh my God!
|Come on, sweetheart.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Because you two were having sex!
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.|Who do you think its from?
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.|Those are all really old!
Yeah...|I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
Thank you. I got a job in advertising.|
Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.|Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Thank you.|What is wrong with Emma?
Celebrity.|It isn't mine!
The chocolates aren't here yet.|Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Hi!
You were my first kiss with Rachel?|What did I marry into?
Thanks for coming.|I love you!
I am sooo drunk.|SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
I think we need to talk...!|Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?
They...do that?|It's kind of a package deal!
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.|You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Aww!|You're ready to play?
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|I really made you think about that thing uh?
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.|Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.|Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!|I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
this is my wife, Nancy.|Or we could throw you both in now!
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.|Don't make jokes now.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
Good for you!|So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty!|Jarvis?
Thank you!|That's like a woman wanting to be a...
But honey you don't have to.|I'm going to get bigger!
You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the|Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before
Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.|Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won’t take my breast?
Oh sure.�|Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|You're gonna be okay?
Oh my God! Let me see.|Monica's grandmother.
Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.|And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
I know..|I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
Hey you guys! Look what I just got.|Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|Where’s my granddaughter? I’ve been practicing my magic tricks.
Hey!|Hey!
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.|It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...|They're never coming down now.
Sure.|Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|11, unbelievable, 11 is correct.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
Oh! Why don't you introduce me?|Oh!
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...|Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...
Okay.� � So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.|Yeah.
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!|Well, what was it?
What!?|Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?|No, of course we're not.
Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?|Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|She said "gleba"!!
Hey, how did the audition go?|Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?|Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!|Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.|If you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.
Is she in there?|Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her.
Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you|None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one
Come on! you...|No!
It could be Amanda!|Hello Monica. It’s Amanda calling again. I am in the neighborhood hoping I can pop by your flat!
I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again  and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.|This is Vicrum.
Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.|Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! .
Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!|Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a reason to come visit.
Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....|Is there anything we should know about the apartment?
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|Only better looking and richer.
Hey...|Hi!
I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.|Ok.� So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Here she is!
No, I arranged that...|No!! Cover it up!!
Jack, look at this.|I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.|No awareness.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|... yeah, it's true.
"I need an answer!"|"I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know."
Well...|Oh stop that!
NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!|It's not a big deal!
So you lied to me before?|Well, we...  "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?|Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!
Ross...|Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
Ross...|Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.|Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
A garden salad for the lady|Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.|Yeah, he can do it!
Hey, what's-what's going on?!|Dude! He's right there!
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.|Please, we're trying to have a conversation.
Ok honey. that was close.|Hello
Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?  Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.|Ooh, I have another idea!
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|Ok!
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.|You kissed her that night too?
With Lennart Haze?|Yes.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|I haven't seen you in like.. a year.
Nothing. It's fine.|Oh thank God!
No problem.|Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
Well, if you think it would help.|Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Is he gone?
Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.|Yes dear.
Everything was delicious!|Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
Oh, happy my wedding day to you!|Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!
No-ot for me it doesn’t.|So, how’s everything going in here?
This place is awesome!|You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
|In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!|All right. . He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.|Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Well, I've… I've been blessed with a… a lot of great roles.
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|But you just said "What's mine is yours"?
All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica|Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone
All right.� All right.� Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?� � Bwa-ah-ah!|I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
What's going on?|WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Look at all these paleontologists!!
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.|Hey! Did you find them?
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?|No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Nighty-night!|What? You never said anything about an audition!
so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.|yeah but she should remember sleeping with me I am very memorable, you guys know.
Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.|What are you talking about? We�re all together right now.
Yeah.|So you eh, you talked to Joey?
Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.|Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?|You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.
She has a lot of crap!|You can?
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.|I'm tired!
Why not? It's brilliant!  Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.|Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
Really?|Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
My God.|Okay.
No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.|Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
Oh, Pervert Parade?|No...
Here you are|Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.|Yeah, a real pleasure.
I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.|I’m 33.
Oh... Okay, sorry!|You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see...  Yeah, I could see it.
We’re seriously asking for our money back?|Excuse me?
I'll see you in the morning .|Mhm-mh!
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|I think these are yours.
Oh my God!|Unbelievable!
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Hey!
Is Amanda here yet?|No.
Oh! Why don't you introduce me?|Er, Rita, this is my husband.
Yeah.|Excuse me!  You didn't tell him, did you?
Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...|I am pretty wisdomous.
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...|Because, it's weird!
Oh man.|Awww.  Bye!
What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like|We�ll see.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Ucch.  <pauses> Uchh <louder this time> In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.
I'm out of here|You're leaving too?
Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.|Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.|Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous!|I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!
Seriously?|I'm leaving you.
No, but you know what I mean.|Really?
Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.|Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would be more comfortable.
Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.|Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
Hey, hey!|Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|We're all sorry...
I understand...|Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|ah ha ha. ah ha ha. <evil meancing laughter> It's forty five.
If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.|Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm...  When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Ok, it's 2100 hours.
Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?|Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
Sure.|Except for "Match game"...
Incentive For Men?|Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...
Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.|This has been torn up.
Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. .|Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
Hey, here you go.|Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?
You're Jewish.|Technicality!
That's stealing!|No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?|Ok, Michelle, it�s time to go.
Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.|"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
Oh my God!|I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Yeah, I guess.|So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!|Who dies?
You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.|Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
We need to talk to you about something.|Are you kidding?
Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.|Well...
I just can’t see Chandler cheating!|Chandler? Forty-five minutes? Well, something is not right. I just can’t believe he would do this to Monica!
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|No.
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|Chandler Bing!
I'd love to.|Great.
Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!|What are you? Eight?
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!|C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?|No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.|Double promise? Call me when you land.
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|You�ve being seeing someone?
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.|Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
Arghhh! Double standards!|No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.|Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!
Thanks!|Hi.
|Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
Nighty-night!|Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.
Well, I don't...|Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?|Are you serious?
Bye, see ya.|Ok.
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please?  I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
Hey, you!|Hey!
God! God! This is not going well.|No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you go talk to my dad?
Sure.|Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.
I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  I'm sorry...!|OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
What?|Get over here!
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!|Ooh... I love Barbados!
Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.|No, they�re comin�, we�re waitin� right here.
Phoebe did the signs!|Is he still mad at us?
Oh my God!|Now, what do you say?
Which one, they all suck!|The museum!
Ow, that had to hurt!|Okay, Rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.
Hey, is Rachel here?|No.
I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!|Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
Okay.  Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.|I can't believe you married him.
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...|Hey!
Thank you, Pheebs!|Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
Hey!|Hey! Where's Mike?
No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!|But can it... just... happen a little bit?
Well, the club lost it's power.|Since when do you watch the news?
Welcome home.|� Oh well, look at you.
Thank you for letting us see the house again.|And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
There's the man I married!!|All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|Weh...*sigh*
Sure.|Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.|Well, if that's what they do in Minsk...
… and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!|Chander…
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Yeah.
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?|No!
Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!|Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
I'll tell you at the wedding.|So sorry Pheebs.
Wow, you catch on quick.|One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...
You too.|Oh, I will.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|"What the hell are you still doing here"?
That's right!|Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
All right, everybody open them!|Oh! These are the ones I was looking at in the store.
All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.|It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?|About a week and a half.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!|Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!
I’m gonna leave the three of you alone.|Okay.
Seriously?|Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?|What are you guys talking about?
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.|There she is!
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...|Goodbody!
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.|You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
Are you kidding me?!|It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
Oh, happy my wedding day to you!|Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back.
Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...|Phoebe you don't have to eat...
What else? What else?|Uh, well he’s 33.
Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?|It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.|Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|I did?
Hey, here you go.|Yeah
You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...  OUCH!|Hit yourself in the tooth?
I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.|I just think there's somebody better out there for you,  I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
Oh. Oh, thanks.|And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.|You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.
Oh! yeah!|You like that?
I know, I still need to talk to you.|Oh and I need to talk to you.
Oh, I’ll get it.|Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?|uhu uhu, check this out.
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|Ok, what is this?
And... taped back together.|Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.
She's mine!|She's mine!
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|This vacation sucks!!
Thank you.|Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...|No, he really said it.
Jack, look at this.|Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.|Yeah, that's it?
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.|Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.
Yeah.|Oh, really!
You've never turned?|No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|She did? Who got her condo in Boca?
Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.|Oh my God! That's wild!
I'm still looking through mine...|Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
What did you get?|USA Today
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Too far, Amy. Too far.
I just wish they'd realise they should be together.|I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!|How do you count to five?
So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.|Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Hi!
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!|Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Uhm... Buenos días, enchilada, por favor...
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?|I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.|I'm telling ya...  I can do it.
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!|She dropped off a casserole?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  That's not nonchalant!
That was fun Pheebs.|I know.� That was fun.�
Thanks.|Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|oh! Now it’s a party!
Previously on Friends...|You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|Right, no, I understand.
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?|Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.|And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.
I am Mike.|
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.|Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
Hey.|I knew I should have married Chandler.
No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.|My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"
Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.|I lost it. To drugs.
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
Well, I'm a lawyer.|Mike, 'attorney at law'!
Oh man.|What's the matter Joe?
Dad, what are you doing?|I think there are people in there having sex.
: how do you know I have one of those?|didn't till just now.
Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.|Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.|Ooh! Tough odds!
So you forfeit?|I can't believe it!  I lost!
No!|I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
Bye... Bye dear.|Nighty-night!
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|Blueberry it is.
Hey!|Hey!
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.
What about your massage client?|I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...|Oh, that would be great!  I love him, I love him, I love him...
Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.|How long was I in there?
You might want to keep practicing.|All right, look.� Just stay there.� I'm coming home.
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.|Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?|Thank you.
No, that seems about right.|We gotta get more of that.
Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.|That's right.� You're husband's home.� So, now the sex can stop.
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|It's heavier then milk!
She's gone.|I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Totally.|Ross, you don't seem okay.
Yeah.|Well, I'm so excited about this.
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.|Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.  Give me your phone.
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.|No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
Incentive For Men?|Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!
Incentive For Men?|You've seen all the movies...
Oh my god, we killed Bob!|Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|No, no, no, but...
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|It’s you. This is yours.
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.|By drowning or...?!
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|Yes… ahahaaa
Hey...|Pheebs, what's wrong?
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...|Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.
Thank you.|I don't have a fax machine.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|I'm sorry, sorry. You're not supposed to say "long pause"
Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...|Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
Uh!|yeah thats a great idea!
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?|Not really.
Ow, that had to hurt!|Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
Pleased to meet you.|Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.
Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?|David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!|I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I'm sorry, but iit-t's true, I love him too.
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room.
How come?|Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.  I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.|Cut, cut! What are you doing!?
It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?|Excuse me?
Previously on Friends...|Hey, great! All right!
Hi!|What?!
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!|Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
Okay!|Merry Christmas.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
We're just making conversation.|Sure! Alright...
Previously on Friends.|She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!
Sure.|Would you stop staring at her?
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.|I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|What?
Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?|You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.
Hello?|Hey, Mike, it's me.� Listen, is um, is Ross near you?
least you've been married, OH MY GOD! I wanna trade lives with Ross|Phoebe  what's wrong?
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!|But I don't want you to.
Alright-y then.|Sorry, everyone is booked!
No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?|Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Bye.|Huh?
Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.|Oh, you're going to Minsk?
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|I do it every year.
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|Menstrual cramps.
so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.|: But you don't remember sleeping with her.
Okay...|OH! SON OF A BITCH!
Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer|I am sorry I am late. You�ll understand when you�ll see Joey.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|Actually yeah, that'll be great.
Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!|Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.|It's seven years ago.  My time machine works!
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...|You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|OK, thank you.
Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!|
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|W-What are you, what are you talking about?
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.|Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day.
What are you doing?|Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Oh God! So what do we do?|I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.|Ah, ah.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Pepperoni...
Hey you guys!|Hey!
Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!|Yes you can!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.|No-no, we do it every year!
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.|You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Either of you girls got a quarter?|Monica, you call it.
Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?|No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!
Really?|No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
Good job.|How could you possibly think that?
Yeah...|Wow! You look amazing!
Gavin Mitchelle's office.|Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone!
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?|or...
Oh My God!|Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".
Here we go!|Okay. Well be careful with her, she’s really tiny.
Where did you go to do it?|Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|Ok, look! Enough is enough!
You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and  especially last night...|
Oh, DAMN IT!|Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...|Who's up for puppets?
I did?|What is she talking about?
Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re talking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf.|Oh there you go!
You still don't know my name, do you?|See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
No, he's in prison.|Was he falsely accused of something?
Uh, actually, that's..|Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
You might want to keep practicing.|I just heard him!
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|Uh, Phoebe, uh...  you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was, was unbearable. Of course the sanitation strikes in Minsk didn't help!
Really? What's that like?|I do like my hair.
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.|That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Sure...
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy  ok well there's gotta be someone.|There isn't that's what I'm saying.
They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!|Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
Oh, I didn't go to college.|No, where did you study acting?
Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?|Nope.
Here she comes!|She? It's a girl?
Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!|What were we talking about?
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!|You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
I'm still looking through mine...|Really? What?
What?!|Monday?!
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!|
Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.|Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|No. Thank you so much for coming in. We appreciate it, thank you.
Yeah?�|Yeah.� I feel so bad.� Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Is that why your hand is pressed against my crotch?
It's not cooler.|Yeah I just hurt it.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.|Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
Hi!|Hi!
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Why not?
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.|It's locked.
What is the matter with you?!?|You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?
I know, that’s why I said again!|Hey.
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!|It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!|Oh my God, what!?
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.|Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
What do you really want to do?|Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
|I haven't really settled on a spot yet!
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.|Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"|Yeah!
Everything doesn't sound fine!|Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
Ok!|And that's... how... it's done!
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|
What!? Of course I did!|Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
How do you know about that?|Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.|Huh ha ha!
I want a baby.|Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
What happened?|...and I was wondering if... you know, maybe one of you guys...
Some of these look a little frayed.|Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.
Bye, see ya.|Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|Wha..? Again with the nature, what are you? Beavers?
Joey's bare ass!|. Well played.
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.|Well, I can't do it either.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|I'm sorry.
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|Well, that’s okay dad, we-we can wait until later.
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...|You're the best friend I ever had.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives .
Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.|Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
Both it is, thank you.|Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it�s ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don�t care.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Uhh, 11!
Arghhh! Double standards!|I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't
14?|Thanks man.
so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.|well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|Are you awake?
Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about|Thank you so much.
Oh. Well then shut me up.|Just tell me how.
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.|I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
I'll tell you at the wedding.|You really want me to come back?
Uh huh...we're playing you two.|Yes dear.
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Yeah, ah, ah . . .� I'll think of something.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.|Well, there you go.
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.|Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
Your boarding pass, please.|Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
What?  Why?|Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
Okay, my turn. My turn.  I won’t.|So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don’t see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?|Boob job.
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?|Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.|Thank you.
Previously on Friends...|Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|Oh absolutely.
Barbados!|Oh, right, because he's a scientist!
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.|No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|Oh... food. No, sex. Food! Sex! Food! Se-I don't know! Good God, I don't know, I want girls on bread!
I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.|Mr. Bing?  Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.|Oh, dear god!
She did? Why?|I made her.  Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|There's something you didn't know about your dad!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?
Hello?|Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
I lent them to Ross.|I gave them to Joey.
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?|No, I didn’t!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Phoe-Be.
That's a huge thing!|Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts  musings, if you will!
Seriously?|Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.|No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Yeah, sure...
Oh My God!|Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
Yeah.|Good night.
Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.|
Hi!|I-Is... Is that a picture?
Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.|: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
No, that seems about right.|Yah, I think I broke my hip.
It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?|But you are a real boy!
Yay!|See? I don’t want it.
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?
I... I... I...|That is so sweet.
Come on, give me something. What's his name?|Mike.
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.|Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!|Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Because I already did!
Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all".  Shall we?|You don't think we should wait for him?
|And say what? "You owe me a goodbye", I mean, he's got more pride than that.
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|Jan-Janice!
Incentive For Men?|Why?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Hi mum, put her back on!
WHAT!|umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...|Thank you.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Her name is Erica.
|Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|It... You can so totally tell.
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|What?
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.|Really?! Even Ross?
Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.|Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!
Yeah, he had a paper route.|Yeah, he did!  Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|She brought them up!  I didn't realize you were coming back so soon!
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.|I know.
Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...|You're not gonna need my help?
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.|Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...|Awesome!
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?|No, and I'm not going to.
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.|Oh... what does that mean?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.
Je m'appelle!|Me pooh pooh!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|It's Joey.
Ow!  Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!|It’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding
I'm sorry, idea time is over.|Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh|I'll get it
All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica|Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?|Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.|Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
Hey, hey!|Phoebe, that is awful!
NO, NO! It can't happen at all!|But why, why not?
Oh, Come on!|Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
Previously on Friends...|Talking to Ross.
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?|"Delta Dawn"
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Oh! Weather bitch!
Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.|Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
I’m telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!|Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.|I mean, you have a lovely home.
I wanna get married|please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times.
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.|How do you feel?
But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.|Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.|Mike is your ex... uh... boyfriend!
No.|Little bit.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?
But now she'll never know how he feels!|Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.
Geez!|Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Hey, what are you kidding me?|I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.
Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.|Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.|It does. It feels really good!
Yeah, I'm serious.  It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!|Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|You are a terrific actor.
Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.|Ooh, that's a great plan!
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|WHAT?
Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.|Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you are, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been feeling…|I know. I know. I’ve feeling…
Honey, that's gorgeous!|Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute. And apparently, there's some big surprise.
Again, you're welcome.|Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?|We got locked out of the apartment, we �
Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..|We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|No, you stay, I'll do it .
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!|Ok!
Oh, good!|Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Who are you kidding?  You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!|Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!
My God.|Joey.
Okay.  Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.|How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
Okay, that helps.|And...Action!
David?|Phoebe! Hi!
What? You know about the plate thing?|Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
Hey!|Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?|Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?
I hope you were using protection.|Oh.�  Should we send them something back?
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!|Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Previously on Friends...|He offered me one.
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!|Rach, she’s got like three hairs!
I'm sorry man.|But, ehm... you watched the tape?
Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.|Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get you anything?|AWCH! That's why.
Joey.|I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
I like those odds!|Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|You know where Joey is?
We need to talk to you about something.|I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
Yeah... it's almost definitely him.|How's that now?
That sounds like fun.|Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?
No you learn these things. You grow into it.|Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|Sure!  Oh...
Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!|Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!|It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
What?|You keep, you keep... You can't...
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Ok.
Yes, but...|Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and
Ross, say something. Anything.|So you two are..?
Gotcha.|Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  But after chapter 16: "fat, single and ready to mingle", I was uplifted.
Occupation? Dinosaurs.|Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.
Barbados!|Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?
Hey! What do you have there?|Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".|Je de coup Clow.
I'll tell you at the wedding.|I don't think they are.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Well, stuffed clams.|Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.
What?!|How long do you have to go for?
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?|Actually, technically, I didn’t.
Sure.|What did I marry into?
Je m'appelle Claude.|Je te flouppe Fli.
Oh, I know, isn't she?|No, I was talking about your bedding.
NO, NO, NOOO!|And that's how it's done!
Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!|Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Ok people, we are back in business!  Ok, go and get your hair and make-up done, and I'll take care of everything.
: how do you know I have one of those?|excuse me?
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|Ok, then, why are you...  all dressed up??
Ok!|I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
No.|Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God... Ross, get ready to do some serious crying.
Yeah.|And that's enough!
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Whoa, whoa, whoa . She cringed!
Really?|Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
Yeah, I guess so.|I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|I'm gonna do it.
Bye, see ya.|So, I don't have to learn what that means?
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Yeah!
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.|Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!|
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?|Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: "Mike, do you take Phoebe..."  You know, it's every girl's dream!
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Hurts, doesn't it?
Arghhh! Double standards!|It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
Oh man.|Okay, bye-bye!
I'm gonna get the lasagna.|Hey!
Wh-what's going on?|Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?|No!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|Easy. Step. How did it get on?
I lent them to Ross.|Yeah! Come on!
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
Ya.|What about  Monica.
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?|No it's not.
You didn't like that?|I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.
AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright...  Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!|Gary Halvorson
She's yours!|Hey!
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?|Oh my God!  Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
Sure, May...tember.|October 18th.
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!|Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together
No|I'll go in there.
Yess!!|We're teeth people Zack!
Can we come in?|Oh, come in.
Incentive For Men?|You like Joey?
Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?|Oh! trying on clothes.
Oh yeah.|What about the guy from the bar?
Not even once.|No matter how much we want it.
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.|Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.|Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.|Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.|This is..shhh!
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!|Oh  Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it won’t stop crying.
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?|C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
Oh... Okay, sorry!|We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man!
I'm still looking through mine...|What?  Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
Yeah!|Let's see!  Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?|Sure, he was in your "band"?
Hey, where have you been?|That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|Thanks.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Yeah...
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.|Seriously, stop staring at her.
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|Let's see if we can get that Rachel back here.
Hello?|Joey, it’s Estelle.
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.|I didn’t give her that ring!
You kissed.|Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?
Hey!|Okay.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Phoebe you're so beautiful. You're so kind, you're so generous. You're so wonderfully weird. Every day with you is an adventure, and I can't believe how lucky I am, and I can't wait to share my life with you forever.
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!|Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?|Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
Yes!|I love you!
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|Wow, he’s really not letting this go, is he?
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!|Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.|Ross, wait!
Hey, where have you been?|Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...|I'd lead with that.
Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don�t you, why don�t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I�ll meet you there.|Oh-A.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|It's stuck!!!
Yeah...|Hi you guys!
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.|Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|UCHH! <much louder and longer then Amy's>
Jack, look at this.|Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!|Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|No, no, no. It's ok. I'm gonna be fine.
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|Mhum.
Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!|Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
Ok, we're still on that.|What are people having, the garlic Martini?
Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do|But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|No,  that that is not what we're saying.
Arghhh! Double standards!|Oh my god.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Sure, sure.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.|Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.|.
Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?|
I've been pretty good!|You look really beautiful.
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...|Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
You're a pig. And you can't do this.|There is a hardware store right down the street?
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer...  Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!|Gary Halvorson
: how do you know I have one of those?|hot not hot  Hot!
Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?|
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?|The thing we never do.
No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it...|So...? What do you think?
Thank you guys for having us over.|I'm up for tenure.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Aaaaand....... hernia.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Do I have a minute to go to the bathroom?
How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?|It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?|Orchids?
What do you really want to do?|Oh my god!
Crazy!|Ooor...
I love you!|Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?|Ahhh!
No it is awesome!|
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!|The sun is out!
Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it...|Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk...  well, you just better watch out.
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!|I'm okay.
Nighty-night!|Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|That's fair, you've had a long trip.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Hey...
Oh !|Where did they go?
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.|Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.|No-no. No.
Nighty-night!|Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go  from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...
Yay!|Okay. It’s Emma.
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|What?
I can't... I can't hear it again.|You know, I can't tell it again...
.|Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
Gotcha.|So I got it when I was 13...
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
Whoo-hoo!|You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws  And suddenly I am the bad guy?
I thought it was Ross.|So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Yes, it's twins!
That sounds like fun.|I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.|Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this!  Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
Me! I'm up for puppets!|Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?
I'm gonna get the lasagna.|Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
No, but you know what I mean.|Absolutely.  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...|You're... you're kidding, right?
I lent them to Ross.|That was the adoption agency...
Who is it?|It's the police!
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|No.
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
So?� What if they do?|Well, we're not here to meet guys.� You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.
Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.|What?
Yay!|You do?
I didn't do that.|Me neither.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|Nah, just me. All alone.  Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.
Celebrity.|Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!|So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
Yes, hi!|James Campbell...
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Hey!
Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!|I don't think so!
And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.|You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
We won.|What?
Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?|Oh... How are they?
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!|oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.|Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
Sandy made Madeleines.|This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
Hey guys!|Hey!
Uh-huh.|Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
Oh God!|Oh...  Little heads-up would have been nice.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Yeah
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Well, maybe I can help.
Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.|Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|I don't think that's what this is.
I hope you were using protection.|� Excuse me.� Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
Okay, my turn. My turn.  I won’t.|I was reliving it.
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this.|What are you singing?
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.|Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Hey.� How come you're answering your own phone?� Where's your crazy assistant?
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?
Humiliating and noble!|You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?|Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
I understand...|For how long?
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!
Heeey!|Hi!
Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.|Honey, you don't have to do this.
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.|Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
Incentive For Men?|No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy.  Yeah.
You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?|Hmm-hmm.
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?|No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|Did she  do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!
...If-you-say-so.|All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started!  Here? All right.
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?|Original or crappy?
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.|It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?|I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.|OH! He's having an affair.
Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.|Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
Wow, you catch on quick.|Well, I have a PhD, so...
Nighty-night!|The one I told you about last week?
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?|I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?|Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.|
Chandler gets pedicures!|Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.|Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.
I'm so sorry...|Ok. If you really need to.
Are they still looking for us?|Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Who is it?|Huh? So? We have a deal?
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.|What is it?
Hey.|Oh no, you guys, just stay here, I’m gonna go check her diaper, Pheebs you wanna come?
No, it's not!|Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
I'm still looking through mine...|Thanks, man.
I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?|Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Pheebs, I still need some help here
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Yeah....
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Wow!
Ohh. Oh wait!  you guys won�t be late for my dinner, will you?|Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We�ll probably be the first ones there.
I put that tube top on as a joke.|I want you to stay.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Worse?
Oh hey! Wait up!|Hi!
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!|Really?
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!|Oh my God!  I'm your groupie!
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in|Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could  share that with a guy.
Okay.|Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|No.
Oh ok.|I am on fire!
I understand...|You have a... You have a date? With who?
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|No.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|Please, just do it!
does what always have to be sharks.|: Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
Okay.|And...Action!
|Oh, my!
She has a lot of crap!|Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.
What's going on?|I'm sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .� I didn't think you'd understand.
Uhh… No.|Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|So do I.
Rach come on, what?|I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
You took the same class twice.|Hey!
Those are the pacts!|Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Okay, now. What?|Cut! Cut!
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.|What?
It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...|Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.|
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?|I have a problem.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|I got married!  Could someone get me a coat, I'm freaking freezing.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|It's your favorite sister.
What about your massage client?|Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
Nighty-night!|Ok! I want the dolphin!
So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!|So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!|Nice to meet you.
Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.|Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.|Hey!
Yay!|Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y’know, nothing goes with Bing. So I’m screwed. I mean…  You want a cousin right now?!
Who's laughing now?|I know!
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can�t remember why.  You�re not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?|Yes, in Oklahoma it�s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less.  Would you like one?
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|I KNOW!
Hey!|Hi.
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|Hey Erica, welcome back to town!  Wow, look how big you've gotten.
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|That kiss never happened.
I'm still looking through mine...|Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
Yes, but we have to be fast.|Emma? Hey! Hi!
Dad, what are you doing?|It can’t be me, I’m standing right here.
Thank you.|Ah, well then there are gonna be a few surprises!
That was a good day!|They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.|Nooo!
I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall.|. Pooh.
Okay, that was Mike.|Phoebe, hi, we�re so sorry. You�re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up .
Arghhh! Double standards!|I'm there!
You got it!  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!|What the hell is this?
I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.|Dr. Wells is a woman.
I don't get a goodbye?|What?
Hey honey!|Hi sweetie!
Yes!|Of course it was!
So we're doing it?|Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together!  Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
But now she'll never know how he feels!|Really?
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Good.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Well maybe you don’t have to tell him anything.
Good job.|Sure, sure. Ok,  See?
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|But I don't want this to end.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Rock on!
Of course, I'd be honored!|Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.
Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?|Oh... you're so sexy!
Oh... okay.|...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that  what's in the inside is important...
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?

Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...|Uhm, I hadn't no you...

I don’t think so.|Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
Her name is Deliah.|So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?
Janice! You're not... gone?|Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
So whose ring is it?|It’s mine.

I hope Ross isn't too upset.|All right, I think I'm gonna head out.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|I don't really care about the Knicks.
Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?|Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
You did?|Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!|You're weak!
Heh.|Well, this is really awkward  Oh, and I can leave!
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.|Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Ok!|This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
Oh!|Come on you guys, we want you to know we're  Right guys?
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.|Yeah, me too.
This is harder than I thought it would be.|Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, or do you have some time?
Chandler gets pedicures!|You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone?  "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.|I know.  I don't care!

Yeah...|Oo...what's in the bag?
Incentive For Men?|I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.|So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
Oh honey...|Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?|No.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
Ok. Why?|Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
See?|Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Are you serious?|Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?!
So, let's do this.|I - I don't think I can.
It's really gone?|Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Oh!|The floating heads do make a good point.
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.|I know.
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.
Hey, hey!|Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics… you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|All right, I guess I'll have to find a new bridesmaid.
Okay, well, bye!|Bye!
Ok|Hi, is Molly here?
I'm not sure about this.|Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
I'm so happy for you!|This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|I know what I felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.
What?|I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
Dude! You're not taking your Bible?|You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|You know? Forget it!
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.|Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!|I'm feeling better.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|Yeah, I understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.
Great.|Bye
Uh!|Thanks! Do you have a coaster? I don't wanna make a ring.
Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.|Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?|No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!|You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or.... No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.|Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Nighty-night!|That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
Why not?|Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
Hi!|Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|No.
Seriously?|"...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?|No, actually, see I had to pee, �cause I can�t use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.|Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.|You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
