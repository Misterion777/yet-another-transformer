What's up?|Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?|Yeah.
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?|I'm adopted?!
Yeah! You bet roomy!|Don't you mean..groomy?
Ya know, I'm going to take off.|So soon?
Really?|Well... there is just one small... stipulation...
… that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.|I see. You didn't happen to tell…
Well, it�s too late now.|Well, ??? think that�s us?
She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.|Phoebe! But I could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.
What? They will be!|All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.
Oh !|Where did they go?
Yeah.|What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.|Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!|Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.|Ok, you have to stop playing now.
Thank you.|Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.|Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing "This is what my sister would look like"
Where the hell is everybody?|Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
What the hell are you talking about,  "The south will rise again man."|Yes, money well spent!
But... but... but we're giving you this!|Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution.
Who's that?|I ordered Chinese food.
Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!|Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.|Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture,
Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.|She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?|You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?|No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
|Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller
Incentive For Men?|Oh, I'll take some of that.
What?|Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
Seriously?|Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair!  And it was uneven for weeks!
No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.|Why?
Oh, Phoebe, I’m sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.|That’s right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there’s no greater gift, than the gift of music.  Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
oh no yeah, no Phoebe is great, but umm I'm an idiot look right before you guys went out I accidentally got her all upset.|that's why she was weird.
No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!|Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
Rachel said she’d marry you?!|
|It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!|Oh, I missed you so much!
Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".|Listen Phoebe...
Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...|Right!
Ross!|Hi!
I think we need to talk...!|Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.|No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|OK Thanks.
Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?|You guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?
All right fine, I pick you.|Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
Sure.|Okay.
Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.|Alright, okay.
Your ex-boyfriend is insane.|Did you get the grant?
You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?|See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?|Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok.  Hmmmm... raunchy!|Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.|What’s the matter?
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|No I left the diapers at the hospital! There’s some in the bag but I’ll run out and get some more.
Watch.  Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.|Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm...  "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
What are you doing?|Emma was doing it!
Here she is!|Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me.  I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she’s looking at me. Hi! I know you.
The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.|Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?|Six!
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?|Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.|Nice.
Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.|Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
Oh my God!� I love things.� What happened?|Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.� And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.
Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.|Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Rehearse it!
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!|What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
The chocolates aren't here yet.|Damnit!
Damn it!|Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
So are you gonna...talk to her?|Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...|Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
No, you didn’t!|Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?|Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.
Wow...definitely just Drake...|What?
Yeah, Ross is here so...|Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
Oh, I know. I know. Hey, you know, you can take it if you want! The lease is still in Nana's name.|No, no. This will always be your place. It would be too sad. Plus, how much a month does it cost to feed Joey?
I watched it!|Keep going Pinocchio!
I don't think so.|I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
They have to learn!|Hey!
Oh, why? What's up?|I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?|Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.|Miss, I can't let you off the plane.
Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!|Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
Yeah?|You blew them away!
Alright, let's see..|We could trade later.
Yes!|Of course it was!
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...|That's... my boy.
This is harder than I thought it would be.|Oh, it's gonna be okay.
No.|Oh, you're so screwed.
Wha. . . hey!|Better!
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.|
EH, what do you know!|You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!|Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.|Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
He’s a keeper. How are you feeling?|Oh, I’m fine.
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!|Growth!
Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?|Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
: hey Joey|Hey, this girl won't turn around and I can't tell whether she's hot or not, what do you think?
Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?|Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
They could be our neighbors, what are they like?|Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she…
Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.|Oh, thank you...
Well, just wake him up!|I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!
Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?|Sure, yeah!
How...how...?|I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.|Hey!
What do you really want to do?|I have *not* thought this through!
So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married.|Oh we-we didn’t.
She was nice!|Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Oh, this is fun.|You’re ready to have a baby? My boy’s all grown up!
It's not cooler.|Yeah I just hurt it.
A place to entertain my lady friends.|And what else is it not?
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.|Well, actually, I think this might help.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!|
That would be a terrible punishment. But, I'm serious, I've never seen these before.|Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.|I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.
Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?|No, of course we're not.
Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.|Joey, wait! The ball!
What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!|Hey, your English is getting better!!
It’s perfect. It’s everything we’ve been looking for.|Isn’t it? Then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?
Oh... my...|Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
That's not how you really feel is it?|No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Honey why don’t you go lie down.|No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office  Am I producing them?
And they love me!|Oh my God!
Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.|Mhm... it's moist.
'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.|'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
Yeah!|Let's see!  Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
It’s the baby’s buttock, she’s breech.|Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...|Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.
We are NOT signing those papers.|Why not?
yeah I didn't disguise that very well did i.|Hey
Oh my God!|Phoebe, I...
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?|I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.|Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!|I'm okay.
Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!|Tails!
We're okay. I'm still ovulating.|Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
oh, honey..|Please.. please, we are so close.
Oh!|How does this look?
I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.|Yeah, exactly.
She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?|Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.|I think you're better than you think you are.
Hey Mikey|Hey P
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.|Wow.
Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....|mmm That's enough about you!
Yay!|So, so is she still going to Paris?
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.|Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.|Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
AH YEAAAAH!|Do you really find this attractive on him?
Where did you go to do it?|Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
Oh my God!|Wow, you look unbelievable.
Monica?|Brian Buckner & Sebastian Jones
Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!|.
No, but you know what I mean.|Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  I'm fine!
Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...
Hey!|Hey!
Game?|Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.|Ah. All right. But my French was good?
Why do you keep looking at the screen?|I'm not. I'm praying.  Where... where are you going?
I know, that’s why I said again!|Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?  That’s just what she wants.
I think we found a place.|Okay.
Well, that’s what I’m here for.  Want me to get that?|No its really okay… Monica!
Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...|It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.|"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
Hey! How was lunch?|
What?|Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
A friend-ship...|Wow! You blow my mind...
Je m'appelle Claude.|Je depli mblue.
No, I don't think so.|You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!|Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."|Honey? Leave it to the pros.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".|je.
Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!|Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?|I'm cold!
What is the matter with you?!?|You were supposed to duck!!! Why didn’t you duck?
Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?|Nope.
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!|Oh my God, what!?
Hey you guys.|Hi!
Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!|Noted.
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.|Hmm mmmhm..
I know, and with the baby coming?|So, should we tell her?
Is something wrong?|No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea...  Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.|Oh, right.
Count of three?|One!
I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again  and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.|Definitely
I like those odds!|Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?|No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
Today.|You said two weeks.
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?|Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.  How about you?
Well, mine was worse than that.|Well, what happened?
Hi! Sorry, I'm late.|Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.|Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.
Is it?|Maybe not, is it?
I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one!|It's not the best!
Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?|That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?
That’s it. I’m done. I don’t care when the baby comes, no more betting.|Okay.
Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.|Never?
So, what are we gonna do today?|They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Hi! I’m so glad you’re here, but it’s gonna be a while. I-I wished you’d called first.|Oh that’s all right, I’m coming back later with your father.
Yeah!|fellas
Yeah.� What do you think?|Well, it looks great.� It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.� So . . .
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
Yeah!|So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
Yeah.|My cousin's a paleontologist.
Oh, I know, isn't she?|No, I was talking about your bedding.
We weren’t picking up, it’s Amanda!|I get pedicures!
Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful. CAREFUL!|I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..|I will explain it to her.
Dad, what are you doing?|I think there are people in there having sex.
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.|Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.|Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?|Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Well...|Oh stop that!
Should we tell Rachel there’s an empty private room right next door to hers?|We could, or we can have sex in it.
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!|.
Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.|Really? That's great!
Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.|Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Hello?  I guess we can bet one more time.|Is Rachel having the baby?
What is the big deal?|It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?|I don’t know, five hundred dollars?
Okay.|Okay.
That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.|Who ?
Right. So, I'm sorry...|Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?
Bye.|Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
Rach come on, what?|I’ve just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.|This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she was…
oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.|you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?
Hey!|Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
How do you even know a woman like that?|What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Thanks.|It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?
I really wanna have a baby.|Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
How do you think I should propose?|David, I'm pretending to read here!!
Oh, what were the other two?|Well, let�s see. The first one is: I don�t want to. And, you know, I�m not going.
Bedsprings, unmistakable!|You do realise that's your brother?
How do you know about that?|Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?|You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Crap Bag.|Mike Crap Bag?
Don't point your finger at me.|Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?
Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?|
No, no, don’t get it. Let the machine pick up.|Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.|M-m.
What are they?|They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
Uh huh...we're playing you two.|We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
We have to leave!!|Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
Space cowboy!|Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.|Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
That’s right. You’re making a commitment and that’s the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?|City Hall.
You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!|I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
Well  I’m wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.|Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!|Really?
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."|Did that movie ever get made?
pelle|pel.
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!|Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…
We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.|Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
Ok honey. that was close.|Hello
Hi... I'm on a date...|That's great!
All right.� All right.� Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?� � Bwa-ah-ah!|What is he doing?
Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!|Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you’re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.|Well I can do whatever I want!  I made her!  Come on little girl, hi!
I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.|Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the "hot nanny".|Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.
Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?|Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?
Oh, I know... I still have my old key!  We can just unlock the door.|Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
Okay.|Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!|Argh. fascist
And so engaged.|What?  Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!
You're Jewish.|Technicality!
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.|Oh, okay.
Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!|Well, you are not doing a very good job!
Yep!|Alright, what was this sentence originally?
There. Here's their card.|Thanks.
OH!|No, I told you...get out!
Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.|That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.
Ah. Thanks.|Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some *pissed off* insurance people looking for that ham.
no they don't|: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
What about your massage client?|I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?|Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?|I don't think so.
I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.|Yeah.
Date of birth?|November 16th, 1968.
You know it's me?|For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.|You need to learn some new slang.
Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!|C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
Huh, I might be losing interest in this.|Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…kinda…wanted ah…start…things up again.
You like me?|Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.|Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?
Is this cool, huh?|It really is.
No one, I’m just saying if...|TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Oh my God! Let me see.|Who's that dirty old lady?
You’re never leaving the apartment!|Say what?
Yeah.|Oh, really!
It’s a funny story, actually.  I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said I’d move to Tulsa, I didn’t really know what I was saying.|You fell asleep?
I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.|Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.|That's great!
What's that?|It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Hey.
|Every time?
Hey! There you are!|Hey!
I’m telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!|Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.|Me too!
Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?� � I heard it.|I'm just going to wait for a little while.
Just get out of here, okay?|What's - what's going on?
Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.|All right!
But honey you don't have to.|I'm going to get bigger!
Hi!|There she is!
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.|You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later.
Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?|Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
Hey!|Hey!
You're kidding right?|Nope.
I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.|I'm so lucky I married you.
How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?|It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.|No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?|Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.
Mike? Okay! What's his last name?|Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
There he goes, your fianc�e.|I guess so.
I don’t think so.|Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
Oh, honey!I can't. I was just telling these guys that things are crazy at the restaurant!|Are you really that busy?
Yeah, maybe.|Then you gotta let them go.
Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!|But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.|I think we may have really done it this time.
Arghhh! Double standards!|Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.|Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
I thought I had to make the jokes!|Don't you have to be at work?
Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.|Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
Hey Phoebe!|Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?|No, we went to the left.
So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...|Oh... Well...
You thought about that?|Yeah.
Well, just... let's try it again.|Ok.
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff .  Who the hell are you!?|Who the hell are you?
Is Monica not here?|No.
One? How about a whole bunch?|Really?
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.|What? You really think she's hot?
About what?|He slept with you and then never called you.
Aw � what?|N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
Didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs? My fiancé was always going away on these long weekends with his tennis partner.|My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.
You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?|Well, not anymore.
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!|It was nice to meet you Rachel.
"Gimme your money, punk!"|Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you… you mugged me?
Hey honey!|Hi sweetie!
Oh, I know.|Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.
Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.|And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
Here we go!|Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!
We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time|Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .|Mmm hmm.
Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.|You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!|What are you? Eight?
Yes.|Well uh if you must know I’m a widower.
Care to venture a guess?|May 12th?
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.
And you told Phoebe you were engaged.|I’m sorry, what?
Look, we can’t stay in here forever.|Oh, I still can’t believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn’t make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!
Well, get back in there and talk!|I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.
Really?|Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.
Dude. You're married to my sister.|You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!|You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
Shake it!|Shake it!
Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.|Sorry.
I don’t think the next patient is very far along.|Okay, well then bring her in.
Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.|Oh, no!
Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!|Wow. Ok.
Now that Rachel's gone?|So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.|Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|Hey.
You have to get a ticket to get past security.|What? We're never gonna make it!
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!|YAY!  quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
Oh my God, this is so cool!|Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...|AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?|Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
THAT'S NOT ME!|What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
Oh! Right.|That's the fastest I have ever thought!
Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.|What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
Uh! Princess Consuela.|You seriously changed your name to that?
Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call|RAT BASTARD!
Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say... None of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years, would have happened if it wasn't for you. No-one has been more like a sister to me...|I know what you mean. You're like a sister to me too.
Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.|We're on our honeymoon.
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?|I guess so...
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!|So? What do you think of the house?
Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?|No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?
I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that|Sure.
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.|But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
What? Who says that?|People who’ve never ever been to Paris.
Good for you. That was really mature.|What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!|I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.|I'll do it.
Ok, ok, ok. I promise, I promise, I promise, I won’t do it again. I really do. I promise. This is gonna be great.|Ok.
That sounds like fun.|Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
Yep!|Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Wiener, Wiener!!!|Rachel!!!
Don't judge me, I'm only human!|Did you take that tape?
Yeah, his name is Ross.  What?|Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.|I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
There it is, you're blushing!|No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
Congratulations!|I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
Interestingly... no.|Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".
I need to talk to you about Charlie.|Oh, do you, do you really?
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.|Man, those two dogs are going at it!
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!|Hey! Hey what's going on?
Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.|Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
|All right! Well, uh...  we're gonna hit the beach?
Like a month?|Or a year?
Oh shoot.� I forgot to pay Phoebe for the drinks.� � Wait, wait.� Sorry.� Did he call?� Did that guy call?|No.� Just his mom.
I just realized why I remember this place.|Really? What is it?
Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!|Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
Chandler, sense the tone!!|Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!|You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
Honey why am I watching a bunch of sharks swimming around.|: Is this not the good part? Do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier.
Yeah!|Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.
Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.|Oh...how much?
Wait a minute! How-how the hell did you beat us here?|We took a cab. Did you guys walk?
Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?|This is your grandmother’s engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
At least you took me down with you!|I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
What?!|What?!
Thanks!|Hi.
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!|No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?|Sure.
Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?|Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
Hey!|So, did you talk to Joey?
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.|Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
What, the blonde with no bra?|She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.|Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.
I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!|The sun is out!
You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?|No.
No, my parents are rich.|Yeah, so... They gotta die someday.  HELLO!
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.|This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
Ah, so glad you decided to come.|Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
So you forfeit?|Mike wins?
Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.|So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.|He’s not really my type.
Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah!|Ooooo!
Pleased to meet you.|Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal and I don’t know where you are, but with everything that’s been going on and with Emma and…I’ve been feeling…|I know. I know. I’ve feeling…
No!|Joking it is!
I didn't do that.|Me neither.
Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.|Good plan.
Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?|Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
What's going on?|WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
See? Intuitive!|What? Where did you hear that?
Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...|Oh no, not all the time... I do the best I can...
I’m getting that baby out of you!|Oh God!
I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.|You can come to my house!
Hey, how did the audition go?|Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|Ok, look! Enough is enough!
What?|Something personal.
We've been stood up.  And we want our free crab cakes.|Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.
Ranion's theory of species variegation?|Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Broke them all, huh?|Yep...
Some of these look a little frayed.|Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
Well, this is very generous!|And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
Here you go.|Shh! Nothing works with this child!
All right, what else?|Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…
Wow!� � Wow, You look . . . uh . . .�� It's just, ah . . .�� That dress . . . uh . . .�|Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.|No-no. No.
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.|We're gonna see each other naked.
|Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!
I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.|I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.
uh uh!|Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!
Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!  "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."|Morning!
She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"|Are you trying to do a British accent?
I really think they’re out of rooms.|They’re not!! Ross, they’re just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?|No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
Hey, so how is it?|I broke my thumb.
Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't.� But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.|I'm sorry. �That's the one thing I can't do.� I promised I'd be with Monica.
Excuse me?|Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?
Yeah...|You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.
She did WHAT?|BE-LOW me!
Well, it needs to be plicit.|All right, let's think about this. I mean, there's got to be an explanation. Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?
Stop it!|PHD
Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.|Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
Yeah, sure!|Oh ...
Oh.|He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weird sexually.
Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.|I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
Frank Jr.Jr.?|Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
Well, stuffed clams.|Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.|You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
Hey, what are you doing?|Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
Me too!|Here
Oh... Okay, sorry!|Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .|Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
I do love you.|I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
You're not making the pies yourself?|No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.|
Joey proposed to you?|I can come back.
Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.|Actually, I think you’re ready to go to the delivery room.
What are you talking about? These aren't mine.|Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
There's something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.|Oh my God, that's just like my name!
Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.|Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.|Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too!  Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?
That's great!  I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...|Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.|Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!|!
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.|But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|. Good choice Ross.
Ok.|I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
It's just a little bit more, honey.|Help me! This hurts!
So, you're ready to do this?|Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.|All right! Who is he?
What have you got there?|Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
|That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|I really made you think about that thing uh?
That was amazing.|I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
Well, I'm a lawyer.|Mike, 'attorney at law'!
Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.|Ooy.
Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...|No, no, it's not that.  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.|How about tomorrow?
Yeaah.|Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.
Please!|Here!
Oh, yeah, ok. Let me just grab my night vision goggles and my stun gun.|I got them!
What!? They are totally ripping us off!|Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.|Oh!
What are you doing here, Santa?|Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
Really? Chandler?|Continue...
Thanks for dinner.|I thought you paid.  Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!
You smoked!|No! I just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!|Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Look, I'm, I'm married!|So? I'm married.
Oh, no, no. That is a doll.|Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy!
Can I offer you a drink?|Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book...
Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...|Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.|"I do".
Oh! How's it going?|It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?|Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.
So, Saturday night!|I'd love to!
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.|Yeah...
Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?|I sent them home.
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?|What? When was this?
Hello?|Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Anybody tell you?
What are you doin'?|Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!|: Ok
Gimmie!|Hi!
Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y’know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.|I didn’t give her that ring!
What?!|You were gonna propose to me?
Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?|Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.
I'm sorry!  This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!|It’s a standard issue bra clasp!
You were under the pile of coats?|I was the pile of coats!
Your lipstick's on his mouth.|Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.
ok|
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.|No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?|You are to me...
Well, if you think it would help.|Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.
Thanks.� � Here's your ticket.|Hey, listen.� I'm never going to lie to you again, okay?� And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.
So now what do we do?|Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony and Chandler's giving you away.|Oh, okay. Hi new dad.
So, do you have any other question about advertising?|No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.|Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here�s a question: "Would you...
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.|Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Oh. You mind if I join you?|Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!|Ok, ok, here we go.
New York.|The big apple!
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is|No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind
I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.|Look at you all grown up.
Uh, where do you think you're going?|I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensing there's something less fun for me to do here.
Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about|Thank you so much.
Whazzup??|Seriously dude, 3 years ago.
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?|Because she is!
owwwww...|Please don't take her away from me!
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...|Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Oh. Well then shut me up.|Just tell me how.
Football? Just football?|Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.
Good morning, everybody.|Can I get you a cup of coffee, Sir?
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?|Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
No, not here. Maybe here.|Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!
I know I am!  ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?|It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.|I can’t say that I’m surprised.
Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.|Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.|Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.|Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Oh! Weather bitch!
Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you|None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That�s not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one
Oh, you did it!|It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.|Well, what would we be doing?
Ok, careful, ok.  Oh, she’s smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!|See, I told you!
I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.|So maybe something in an office.
In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now.|Oh, wait, wait!
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.|"Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"
Yep, can you believe it?|Nope!  I still can’t believe she slept with you in the first place.
Hey! Ready to go?|Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
Why?|I heard you were sick...
I know.|How bad you wanna smoke, right now.
Wow! That was amazing!|Thank you so much for that gift!
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?|Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.|Oh, great!
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.|Okay.
Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.|Is he gonna introduce us?
Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.|No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.|Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?|Half a dozen.
Done it.  I'll be back in a couple of hours.|I'll miss you.
In that case should I make sure it's on real good?|Thank you.
You still don't know my name, do you?|
Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.|Hey, that was an honest mistake!
No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!|And she wants to go hunting, too!!
What! When?|I dunno!
Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.|You don't know military time?
Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...|YOU! You feel!
Sandy made Madeleines.|This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.
I know.|You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!|Thank you! So, can I stay with you?
Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.|And you fixed the Philange?
Ye....|Hi! There you are.
Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I�m never leaving her again.|I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: �Mommy, I�m a girl, take me with you.�
Hi!|Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?|I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
Oh, we are so lucky!|I know. He has your eyes.
Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?|Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
Yeah.|And that's enough!
Ross, where are you going?|To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?
Guys!?|Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart...|Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
No!|OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
O-okay.  So, is she gonna take the test?|Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
I hate my friends.  Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.|Like what?
You must think I'm crazy.|No, I think you're sweet.
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?|Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.|Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
Joey, give me the bag.|Hit me!
"Dude, Where's My Car?"|What?
Mississippi? I said count to five'!|Mississippilesly?  Well, how bad is it?
Oh, it was so much fun.� It felt so good to be out.|Uh, Rach.
I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!|Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
That is not true. She did! She forced me!|Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
I just can’t see Chandler cheating!|I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
I got off the plane.|You got off the plane.
No you really think that's what it is?|You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymore|Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
|Michael!
Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.|What? You do? You do?  Oh my God!
It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.|God works in mysterious ways.
Thanks.|Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
Hey!|Happy wedding day!
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.|Come on! Joe!
Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!|Yeah I know.
Really?|No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.
You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.|Okay, guys, wish me luck.
Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?|Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.|I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.|You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
Yes!|Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.
A-alright! I can do this.|There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Yep.|So I guess Rachel had you baby?
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!|Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Bye, see ya.|Ok.
So?|So...I've never played that!
Madame, your passport please?|Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn't gonna remember any of my high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!
Yes.|This is your current cellphone?
I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.|Why did you go along with that?
What are you talking about? Sarah's great!|Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok?  We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
NO, NO! It can't happen at all!|But why, why not?
Hi.|Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Yeah, right Monica.� I'm so sorry.|Ah, it's an honest mistake.� It could happen to anyone.� All right, see ya.
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!|Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.  Not you guys. You got it going on!
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!|Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
Oh, Ja! Ja!|Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
You know that’s… that’s her.|Oh god look at her sleeping.  Oh, I love her so much!  Oh, I think I’m gonna wake her up.
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.|You're right.  Maybe I shouldn't go.
ok I can't do this.|what's wrong?
Gavin Mitchelle's office.|Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone!
Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.|Damn it, I did not think this through!
What... what you working on?|Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...
I don't know what... you're talking about.|Really?
Either of you girls got a quarter?|Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
Okay. Okay.  Umm hi, this is Rachel Green. I’m Ross Geller. We-we called from the car.|Right! We have a semi-private labor room waiting for you. So in just a minute…
Thanks for coming.|Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
I thought so.|And listen to this...
Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?|I am a doctor! Y’know what? I’m just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.|There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .|Hey guys!
Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know?� I should just . . . move on with my life.|Really?� You're moving on from Ross?
You can do the presentation.|No, I can't, I have a baby.
Ow...Oh Gosh!|10 seconds, you need this or you lose the game.
What... for how long?|Only like a month!
That's what I hear, yeah.|This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Oh!|I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't.
My God.|Joey.
Wow|Here!
Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up!  I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.|"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
No, come on, you know that's not true.|What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—|See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
Hey!|So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.|I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
Oh!|Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
Hi.|Hi.
Yeah.|I did, too.
Yes|I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
Me too. I'm good at it.|All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.|No.
Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word "lorkins" what flowers would that be?|Orchids?
Hi!  Excuse us.|Please...
I did not see that coming.|Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
What?|You keep, you keep... You can't...
We won!|Let me see!
Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.|That's great.
Yes, it's also 2003.|Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
You didn't like that?|Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.  Yes?|If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
And that would have made the official party line.  Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.|Yeah, I know.
Okay, look, just do it gently.|You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!|Well, I-I said yes.
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!|Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Oh yeah!|Right, fine, I�ll do it, but no talking.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Rock on!
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.|Oh my God!
The comedian? USO?!|Uhm, it's USA, sir.
Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.|Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?|Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
Hey, you said that without gagging!|I know!
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.|Sorry.
I did?|What is she talking about?
I wanna get married|please don't cry because of me pheebs I don't know what I'm talking about, I've been divorced three times.
I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.|Chandler!
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.|I love you!
Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.|Ugh.
That's sweet. Drink your hair.|Hey, what's all this stuff?
oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.|oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.|They thought Joey was a child?
Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!|Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.|Good yeah just be honest with him.
.and I said Vicrum you can't just call every time you get lonely you know, you, you gave up that right when you slept with Rachel.|But Rachel I thought she just had a baby with Ross
Hey!|Hey!
Hey, you only heard Monica�s side of that. That little fatso was a terror.|Ish. I just don�t think I can bear it.
Ross said he died.|He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
Do you even know what a banana hammock is?|It's a funny word.
Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen.|Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
Janice! You're not... gone?|Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.|Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?|Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
This doesn't concern you!!|Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
Nana liked it rough!|Hi!
Did she go out with him?|No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.|Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
You do?!|Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...  OUCH!|Hit yourself in the tooth?
I love you more!|Not possible!  She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.
What!? Of course I did!|Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?
Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.|All right.� Well, I'll check the guest room.
There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.|What's so bad about that?
You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?|But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.
It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.|Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?|Yes... What is the end of that sentence?
Tips not included.|Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Hey.|Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.|Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
Oh hey you guys, I couldn�t get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.|Thursday? But that�s Halloween.
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!|I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
|Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.
Hi Dr. Long, how are you?|Oh, you’re nice to her.
Hey, I was looking out for you.|Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.|Ehh.
Morning.|Hey!
So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?|I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma’s books.
Oh!|It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
|Bye!
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…|Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?
Oh, this is such a cute picture of Emma. And is this your son... or just some kid whose picture you bring on vacation?|That's Ben, my son from my first marriage.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Did you just push me?
I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be  just nifty!|Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
I would, but you're the last one.|Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
Yeah, I did.|. You are SO going to Heaven!
Both it is, thank you.|Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it�s ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don�t care.
No, I'm saying...|but, but..
Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.|Really!
Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.|Got stood up, huh?
It doesn’t happen to me either.|Me neither.
Sure?|Yeah, I mean whatever.
Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!|Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.|Oh!
Oh!|Jarvis Oberblau, Cornell. .
Yeah, yeah, I guess.|Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..|I haven't slept in four years!
Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.|Oh.
He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...|Oh, well... That had been your window.
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.|Man, that's some bad advice!
Hey!|Hey!
Yeah! I'll cook!|Yeah! Let's go out.
Yeah, I guess so.|I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.
We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!|I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!|Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
Joey, we're not keeping this!|But it's an original Buffay...
Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?|Oh... you're so sexy!
Great! Come on in!|Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
C'mon guys, it'll be fun!|All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
No... no...|I mean...
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.|Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
Alright, I'll be right back.|Where are you going?
Hey!|Hey!
Yeah, we met in college.  I mean, high school.|Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
OK.|So hum...Why did I have to hide?
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.|Just ah… just put roommate.
Thank you.|Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?

Hey!|Hey!
Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...|Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
Name?  I know Ross but what’s it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.|Just Ross!
Really?|Really?
But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?|Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!|So how've you been?
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.|Was your cabin pressurised?
I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?|The next baby should be along in a minute.
What?|Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Oh, happy my wedding day to you!|Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|Yeah! Welcome, it is Soap Opera week here on Pyramid, let's meet our contestants. First, Gene Lester is a database specialist, he's gonna be playing with "Days of Our Life's" star Joey Tribbiani!
No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!|Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
Hey!|Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?|No, no, I just have to talk to someone.
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.|Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
Really? That hadn't occurred to me.|They just gonna love you, just be yourself.
All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.|Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
Dear Lord.|I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?
Yes, but...|Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.|
I can't believe I never realized this before, I'm in my thirty's and never been in a long-term relationship oh my god  what's wrong with me.|no, no, no there's nothing wrong with you I mean you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.
Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?|Uh...well...just once...with you...
Did he go out for a cigarette?|Yeah, four times.
Oh how lame... oh, it’s so tacky, and impersonal.|Really?
Oh my God, what's it doing here?|Uh! What a pickle.
She's gone.|I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
Rach, these are for you.|Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
Could you press up too please?|Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Promise?|I promise.
I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.|But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
May I help you?|Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
Hey!|Hi!
There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!|So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
You really think so?|I really do.
It's open.|Hey!

Good night!|Seriously, good night!
Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..|Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
So whose ring is it?|It’s mine.
Why am I hearing cheering?|Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...|Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...|Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?

Oh! yeah!|You like that?
So, what's new?|Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
You don’t have to worry about that okay?|Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They’re right on that chair under Ross’s coat.
That's great. What kind of music do you play?|Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|Hi Phoebe.
Good night.|Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?|Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought “who better then a minister to raise a child!”
Really?|No!
You guys, I’m doing the best I can, anyone else is welcome to try.|Alright, I’ll try, fine! Yes, Okay!
Oh God! Is that veal?|Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.|It's OK!
All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so|Ok. First of all, this is green!

A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.|Who's Gladys?  Oh! What a tragic loss!
Oh! What are we gonna do?|Just be honest with her.
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!|I'm not playing with you.
I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again?  No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.|It’s…it’s complicated okay?
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.|But also knowing it means a lot.
Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?|Lima.
It's ok that's how you feel.|But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.
Right, totally.|Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
Hi!|Hey.
Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound � and the breasts of a Greek goddess.|Pheebs?
Do you hear something?|They're out there!
It's a... It's a boy!|Wow!
Uhh… No.|Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}
Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?|Oh, well... Maybe we could...
least you've been married, OH MY GOD! I wanna trade lives with Ross|Phoebe  what's wrong?
Great! We will do all of those.|…taking a long walk, and then there’s the one that’s proved most effective: sex.
YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND  IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!|Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask.
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.|Ok...
That's shocking!|Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross!  He's rude!
What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?|You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.|Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?|Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
I don't get older. I just get better!|You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
Alright, alright, let's do this!|Okay!
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?|Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it!
Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?|It doesn’t make any sense.
Do you have any ideas?|Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...
Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?|That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
Oh God.� Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?|Oh God.� It seems like forever ago.
What the hell are you doin'???|I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?...
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this|Are those my wife�s nipples?
We'll call you!|Okay.
Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but maybe it’s right.|What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!
Forget it.|Oh wow! What now Ross you’re not gonna talk? How on earth will you ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know.  What are you doing?!
Just give us the cheapest room you have.|Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
And you would?|I did!
You're filthy!|Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!|Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
Does that mean we have to bust it open?|I don't know. Maybe.
Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!|You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…
I'm ok.|I'm sorry...  Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.
Ah, it's been so long, so long.  I can't believe you're still doing this!|Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!
Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...|Thank you.
What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.|Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
Why... I... I don't know.  Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?|hmmm...
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?|No.
Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.|Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
Oh, my first love!|Oh!
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.|Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Really, you want to wait a year?|It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer."  It'll probably be more than a year.
Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!|But it's just...
Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?|I'm Mackenzie. My stupid parents are selling this house.
You really think I didn't say goodbye to you because I don't care?|That's what it seemed like.
Hi.|Hi.
No you learn these things. You grow into it.|Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.
Well, not anything, I mean...|Yeah... anything.
I’ll be back in an hour to check you again.|Thank you.
Come on! you...|No!
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?|Not really.
Bye...|RACHEL!
Oh, thank you so much!|Yeah, and so funny!
Ooh...|Still nervous?
Which we’re still keeping under our hats!|Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.|Because of Emma.
Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.|Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
So bad.|So bad.
Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.|Oh. Wow.
Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.|Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would be more comfortable.
Ha! My point!|Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
does what always have to be sharks.|: Honey look we can do something else, do you want me to get into the tub and thrash.
Hey Phoebe.|Hey. Everything ok?
No.|Little bit.
Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?  Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.|Ooh, I have another idea!
Money!  Friends...|Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?|Not really.
"You know!"|"I don't know!"
I gave you my number, you never called me.|No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Okay, how about this, you guys die and the crazy plate lady dies, then do I get the baby?
Ow, that had to hurt!|Hey, it’s your Thanksgiving too, y'know, instead of watching football, you could help.
Look what I found in the drawer...  And you said I'd never wear this...|Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.|Well, don't be.
It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".|It sounds interesting!
All right!  Yes!! From home to the hospital in under seven minutes! We did it!!|Yes, the hard part is truly over.
Ahhh!|Let me finish ...
Uhm... Stockholm.|Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.|Dude, are you okay?
Ross, hi. It's me. I just got back on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted things to end with us. It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... And now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't. I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I've gotta see you. I've gotta get off this plane.|Oh my God!
I... I... I...|That is so sweet.
Even so, I think I'm gonna pick Ross.|Let me tell you why you need to pick me.  See, when I was a kid, I was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. You know, I was always picked last in gym. Even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. I mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. Anyway, If I'm the only one left out of this wedding, I just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.
You are an amazing wife.  No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.|: Im very, very drunk right now.
I'm so happy for you!|This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?|Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!|I'm gonna miss you so much.
Just put it on a plate and leave.|Okay, let's find these birds.
yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.|I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from the coffee house.
Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5…4…|3-2-1 oh!!
A little more, a little more.  A little more... All right. Okay, all right, let's do this.|All right, ready?
That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.|Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.|Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question.  Do you guys do random drug testing?
Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.|Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!|What? How come that you don't have to go!
Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!|Oh!
Okay.  Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.|I can't believe you married him.
let ME be a part of this!|: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!|I know!!! My erection is back!
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.|I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you.|Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to me, but Joey did.
Okay.|Okay, let's try this one more time.
Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!|Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
But I already told Zelner that I would come back...|I'm sure he'll understand.
Time for your scalp massage!|
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.|So...
Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!|No, that landed in your food!
Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.|I can’t. I can’t push anymore, I can’t.
Oh, you're so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?|Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing|No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
Never.|wow, are you still going to move in with him?
Okay.� � So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.|Yeah.
I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.|I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
You are not at Thanksgiving?|No...
That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.|It's seven years ago.  My time machine works!
You, you want me to help you with that?|Why, does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw?
Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?|I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.|I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
Oooh.� Let's do.� Let's send them mashed potatoes.|No!� Wait!� No, no.� Don't do that!� That's going to make them think they can come over here.
...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.|Well, if that's what they do in Minsk...
Alright, we�ll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye.  Huh, that was my mom, she�s stuck in terrible traffic.|Okay, well that�s now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|
I know.|You're a really good kisser.
Totally.|Ross, you don't seem okay.
You what? You said you liked them.|Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.|Joey.
Let's celebrate with some maple candy!|No!
But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...|He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?|No.
I didn't know you knew about that.|Well, I did and it hurt.  That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
I am a single parent.|It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
Honey, you're screaming.|YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.|I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me?|I was not!
Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?|Well then he gets a divorce, it’s Ross!
I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.|Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want.  Give me your phone.
You guys, we�ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.|No, no, it�s okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
And you're thinking of taking it?  new job.|I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
What happened?|Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
Hey, what are you kidding me?|Right-o, right-o...
So seriously...rodeo clown?|One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.|Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
How do you know?|Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?|I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Sure! What?|Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do|But, what�s great is that you don�t mind talking about it.
Come on, lottery!!|Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?|How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
14?|No, 19.
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.|Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:|: is everything all right?
… everybody we know? Yeah.|Great. Thanks!
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.|I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?
I'm gonna get the lasagna.|Hey Rach...
No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!|Oh my God!  I'm your groupie!
What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?|Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.|Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!|Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
I want a baby.|Honey, we’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.
Hey... Wh... What are you doing?|I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What are you doing?|You don't wanna see what I just saw!
I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you|come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was  here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
Oh, Rachel!|Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Oh, water would be fine.|Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.
So . . .� Welcome.|I got beer.
A pigeon, a pigeon.  are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.|Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that�s true.
Hey!|Hey!
Somebody went to college. Wow.|No, I’m sorry. It’s just my foot itches like crazy.
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.|We really need to take those tests?
|What?
Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day.|He just left.
Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!|Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through ...
I do.� I do.� Although, it's actually a lager.|huh.� � What's the difference between beer and lager?
Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.|Really? She... she loves me?
WHAT! WHY?|well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
It was ...  oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.|But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
Okay, now. What?|And...Action!!
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!|I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
Okay, then I'm Swedish...|So, what's your name?
Joseph!  Thou needn�t worry, they shan�t be long.|It�s just that we do have some large parties waiting.
|
Why don't you tell her my name?|This is my husband Crap Bag.
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.|Oh yeah? Well, let's see.
Bye... Bye dear.|Nighty-night!
Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?|Oh... How are they?
Oh sure, now you�re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle�s funeral|That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I�m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?|Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.
I got you something from Vermont!|That's weird...it's empty!
Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?|No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.|Ooh, that's a great plan!
We’re having a baby.|I didn’t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but do you think we have time to…
Ok.|Ok. Hold on.  Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.� You know, like, "Hi, How do I look?"�  "Really sexy.� Could I BE any more turned on?"|Okay.� � Whoa, whoa.� Why are there two glasses of wine out?
Emma's down for the night.|Oh, good.
Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it...|Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!  Here David, you should just go.
Yeah...|I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?|Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!|You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?|Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|Stop going through my stuff !
Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.|Can I get you another glass of wine?
I just wish they'd realise they should be together.|I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
Enjoy!|What did they say?
By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.|It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?|Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Hey bear, I need some career advice.|Tracy Reilly
Oh My God!|Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!
Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!|Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
All right. What's your news, Amy?|Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
Ohh.|Okay, one thing at a time.
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.|Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?|I don't know what to say.
Yeah?|Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?|Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
Alright fine. I'll do it.|Good.
Come on in, how are ya?|I'm good!
Ross?|I never gave it to you.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?|What did I just say?
You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?|That I can do.
Me too.  You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.|Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Yeah, who is that?|Do ya?
Hey, I need a ticket.|Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.|I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.|Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one
How do you fix the chair?|Except that!  Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.|Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
I don't know.� We could look it up.|Things are about to get wild.
Hey. Where've you been?|I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.
What?|That's impossible.
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.|Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animals.
Uh!|Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.|Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing really well right now.
Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.|Phoebe and I are moving in together.
N… No! We took a cab too, but I did test runs!|Hi!
I do love Mike.|Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
m'ap|mah
Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?|No, and I'm not going to.
What? Who?|The guy you gave your number to.
That was kind of rude!|Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.
Phonetically?|Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.|Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.
Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.|Sure you do.
Your age?|A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
Hey!|Hey!
And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.|So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?
Jack, look at this.|I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
Oh, yay!|Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.
Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!|What are you, a child?
Excuse me?|Rach we have a code brown situation.
That's my bubby!|So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.� Um. . . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
Uh-hmm.|I love you so much.
Can we come in?|Oh, come in.
Phoebe!|I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?|Yep, we got it, we got it.  Thank you so much.
What is the matter with us?|Well, I know what's the matter with me.
No, not if their room has two beds!|moonlight boat ride!!
She doesn't have a stomach ache, she's in labor.|Oh my God!
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.|So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Look at her, my first grandchild.
Ouh…|Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?|: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.|Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!|Rach!
I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...|You have to tell David!
I guess you're right.|You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
Emma's awake.|Yeah?
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.|I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.|Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
Dude, you're shaking!|I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
Merry Christmas.|Merry Christmas, you guys!
I just can’t decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?|Oh what are you kidding? She’s gorgeous, it’s all Rachel.
Yeah, why?|Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
Hi honey I'm home!|: Hi, how was your flight?
So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.|Well—Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.
Ya.|What about  Monica.
Oh my God! He did it?|Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?|Ok.
Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?|Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...
Yeah, you've... you know, sort of been like a dad to me. I mean, you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom...|I am pretty wisdomous.
Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace|You already hit on me an hour ago
Yeah. Me.  Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.|Uh-huh, yeah.
Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!|Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?|You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.|Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!
Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.|All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we
No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.|You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox".  Oh god! Oh!
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.|Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?|Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
I'd love to stay, but I have eh...|Please... go!  Just let me know if you need a hand!
What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...|What?
You're... weird!|Your pants are undone!
Ah, yeah!|Do you?
Yeah, he's done some amazing works.|Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.
Tulsa, Oklahoma!|The Sooner State, whatever that is.
Age?|Can’t you figure that out based on my date of birth?
Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, so he said: "If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."|I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?|Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.
Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.|How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?|Hm-hmm!
Your hands are shaking.|I know, and I can't stop sweating.
Hey! Sleeping beauty!|Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!|There you go! Someone came!
Well... I just talked to Sid, we are definitely putting in an offer on the house... a-a-and I'll bet we get it.|The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
Yeah.|Oh my God, we did it!
I know!  Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!|Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?|No. I can't be away from you for that long.
Hey!|You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.|Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
That'll work!|I don't think so.
Yeah? Okay.|Ooh! Ow!!
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.|Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.
Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.|I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.|Dude!
You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and  especially last night...|
Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.|Uh, Rach?
It's "Bolero" from "10".|It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
I can't imagine what he sees in her.|She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his.  Oh, hello dear...
everything's great, just watching some regular television there, what a pleasant surprise.|: I'm gonna go freshen up ok
I do too.|This is huge!
Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!|What are you doing?
So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!|So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.
Hey!|Hey.
Those are the pacts!|Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
Well, do you think I should propose?|I think it could be kind of great!
Okay Marjorie, hit it.|Geez Ross, you could have showered.
Oh God! So what do we do?|I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?|Oh, it's perfect.
I just really wanted to apologize again and… and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.|
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.|Hey, how'd the interview go?
Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.|Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?|You don't trust him?
I'm sorry, no.|Okay.
What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?|It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?|Yeah, I'm sure.
No, no, I should get home, I'm kinda tired.|Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|And that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swingset...
Oh wait.. What are you doing?|Setting the table.
Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.|And a lot could still get in our way.
No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?|Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.
Oh, ye-ah!|You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?|Done. Oh good, really?
How come?|Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!|Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?|Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
Yeah.|It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?
That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!|Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?|Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Oh! That feels sooo good!|Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.|Joey asked me marry him.
Okay|This is your cellphone?
your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get you anything?|do you have any cake?
Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?|Sure  who are you?
Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?|Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.
Oh my god, this really hurts!!!|I couldn’t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
Thank you so much for this.|Oh, d'you like it?
Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!|You don't like him.
Hey!|Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
Yes, but we have to be fast.|Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?|I�m so sorry �
Oh yeah.|What about the guy from the bar?
Okay.|Bye.
I’m just mad at my agent.|Estelle? Why?
If you hold a spider.|WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.|Ow!
Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"|Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?|I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?|Y’know what? This one is.
Yeah, actually I am!|I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.|But you left.
I don't know.� He was cute, and he liked me.� It was an impulse.|What about Ross?� What about your moment?� Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
Do you not know each other?|Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...|Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
Are you on board?|Yes.
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn… on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house!|Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that…
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in|Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!|Chandler, I…
You told us both we could be in the wedding?|Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at|Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?
Ok.  Wha...? where? Where are you going?|Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"!
So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!|No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.
I love you too.|Allright. See you later!
Oh my god!|Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|Oh, you guys, I can't believe this. But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.
And so incorrect!|She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
Oh hey Ross oh I'm so glad someone's here could you zip me up?|sure.
Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you, don't I?|Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you "momma's boy", starting right now.
Today is the sixth.|No, it's not.
Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.|Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
Umm ma’am, do you have a minute?  I kind of have some bad news. I don’t think I can move to Tulsa.|What?
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!|Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
You can’t marry him!|Why not? I don’t want to do this alone! And he’s such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.
This thing welded shut?!|Okay.
All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?|I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
Hey Joe!|Hey!
Here you are|Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
Oh, thanks guys!|I thought... it was wonderful!
Again, you're welcome.|Look, I'll just give you this and go.
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?|I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.|Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
We won.|What?
Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.|You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.|Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?|I didn't mean a thong... I meant thongs...
And that's not all I'm allergic to.|Oh, it's not over!
You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?|. That didn't make us sound gay at all!
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.|Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
I need to say goodbye to the table first.|I understand.
Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.|Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!|If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant, okay?|Honestly! Ross, this isn’t just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
Great.|Bye
I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family.|Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.
At one point near the end she deliberately defecated.....|Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.
So far so good!|Honey, I'm old!
Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?|I uhm... Well, I sang...
What?|What?
No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  I wish I'd thought this through.|I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!|Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
Hey!|Hi.
Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"|Yeah I do rock that one.
uh-huh|And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
Thanks!|Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
Barbados!|Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right!  This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.
Will you wear a thong?|I will if you will.
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.|Bye!
I'm still looking through mine...|Just double checking  No!
Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.|Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
Erica, are you okay?|Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Ross?|Huh?
You really think this man is speaking French?|Sa-sa-saw!
Ohhh.|So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?
No.|All right, I’ll see you downstairs then.
Gladys?|Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.
Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!|You're weak!
Oh no no no|So I had fun last night
Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!|That’s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
… and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hut tub and start making out with each other!|Chander…
Excuse me?|Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
Yeah. What-what are you doing here?|Well, I'm back from Minsk... permanently.
Be-caaauuuse...|All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
We're back!|Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
Seriously?|Yeah-uh!
Joe...|Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!
Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.|Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!|Hey, what are you guys doing?
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.|You know what? You can have mine.
No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!|Hey!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?|Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
Yeah.|Oh, she looks just like a little doll!
I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream.  I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.|Uh.  Did you call your parents?
Uh-huh.|Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?|Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
No, she was definitely on my bed.|Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
We are even, right?|Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to|
I got it.|Thanks.
Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.|Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!
Not even once.|No matter how much we want it.
It's really gone?|Yep! I'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career!
Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here.  What’s the matter?|Nothing.
Okay!|Merry Christmas.
We only ordered one!|You know it's twins, right?
Oh, it's fine.� Actually, I, I invited Mike over.|Phoebe's Mike?
No! We're not borrowing money.|Why not?
So we're doing it?|Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together!  Oh god, we're really going to move in together!
Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?|Yeah! I think that's great!
Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.|Oh good.
I know, yeah.|I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.|If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.|You mean, when you were a baby.
uh huh|do you have a compact in your purse?
|Unscented!
Whenever you're ready Joey.|Right.  Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
Oh . . .|I'm so glad you're back.�
Hey you guys! Look what I just got.|Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
You had a rough day, uh?|Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
So he hasn't called?|would you call this girl?  thanks-fo-r-a-love-ly-even-ing
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|No, I don't mind you touching my belly, but right now your hand is kind of blocking the part where the baby is gonna come out.
Oh, come on Ross...|No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...
I lent them to Ross.|I gave them to Joey.
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?|No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Really?|Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that’s him! That’s him!|Great! Go get him.
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?|No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it.
|So where are you applying to?
Joey's bare ass!|. Well played.
Yeah I bet! Look out!|OH! OWWWWW!
Yeah.|Yeah.
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.|What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Name?|Chandler Bing.
Wow, that is tempting.|Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
Okay, we're gonna start in the kitchen. Plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box. The silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. Got it?|Yeah.
Hi!|Hey.
Don't you want to look through the rest?|I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.|Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
She's yours!|SHE'S YOURS!
You have gotta stop!|But she liked us.
No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.|Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?
Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."|You, touching yourself, out!
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...|Monica told me you had a blind date.
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".|No way!
What?|This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
Wow.� So, what did you guys do?|Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.
Nothing, huh?|No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
What's going on?|Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?|Maybe...
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.|Rach!
Wow.|You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.
No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you|Why?
Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...|Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!|Well, you lied again!
Oh.|Ooh, who's it for?
|Did you watch the tape?
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...|No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
How was everything, sir?|Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!|You ready to go?
No.|What do you mean "no"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.
Can you?|Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
Great game, huh?|Uhuh, uhuh...
I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!|No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.|That's worse than no food.
Hi!|Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Really?|Yeah, I don't know why, I'm sorry, I guess I just didn't want to lose face.
Oh, Pervert Parade?|No...
yeah your both so slutty you don't even remember who you've slept with, you're made for each other.|Interesting. all right I'll go out with her again and try to get past it  OH SALT BLOATY!
What? What?|He’s looking at me.
Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!|Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!|I'm sorry...
Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.|For what?
Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.|Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
I'm still all those things!|You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!|No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...|Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?
Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.|Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
You can't move at all?|Oh, well, I can move...
That was a test and you just failed.|Damn it! Rookie mistake!
But we don't do that.|I know, I just thought it would be fun.
She has a lot of crap!|You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...
Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.|You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
Well, well, they're good.� It's been a while since I've seen you like this.� You, you clean up good.|Oh well, well thank you.�
Good for you!|So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?
Especially Ross!|
Yeah.|She even reads for pleasure!
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.|: Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
Hey.|Hey. So, what did he say?
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.|More foosball?
Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.|Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
Oh, I’ll get it.|Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.|Oh my God, I love you.
Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?|How do you think I got him in the first place?
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!|What?
Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.|Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth
NO, NO, NOOO!|And that's how it's done!
Hey!|So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
Eye-contact?|Mm-hmm.
Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.|Totally. I had sex in High school...
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?|Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
Ah, let me see!  Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?|I think I am.
Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.|Ok, you got it!
Oh my God!|I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Look at all these paleontologists!!
All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.|It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.|Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
We got some really great stuff!|Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?|Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.|I'm not your brother.
�kay, see you there. Happy humping!  Hey�hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don�t people know, you�re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?|Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.|
Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.|Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.
Yes?|Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
Where are Bill and Colleen?|They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?|Oh! trying on clothes.
Everything was delicious!|Thank you!
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?|Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I…it’s beautiful I love it!
Can you please, please take care of it for me?|Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
It�s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it�s like you lose a boyfriend,|Uh-ah!
Lowell, is that you?|Phoebe?  Oh my god!
Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.|That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Hi!|Hey!
But you didn’t give it to her?|No!
She did?|You got it!
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!|See?
Hi!|Hi!
Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...|It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!
Yeah...!?|How did she get me to settle down?
Hey!|Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?|Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.|That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|It is so amazing to meet you.  I'm such a big fan of your work.
Joey!|You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
Je m'appelle Claude.|Je do call blue!
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?|...No...
Serve the ball, chump!|: Serve the ball, chump.
Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.|That's true.  Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?|I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?
Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.|So he can't come?
Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?|No it's not.
I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.|That must have been hard.
You are going downer!|Is that what they say on the Figure Skating Team?
NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!|It's not a big deal!
Well, then who was on my bed?|
A garden salad for the lady|Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.|Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?|I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.
Hi|Hey!
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Sorry about the table, man.
You might wanna get back in there.|Ok!
She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.|Hi!
Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!|Cool!
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said|Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,
What? What?|Could you get me a muffin?
Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?|Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.
I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y�you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby�s sleeping.|What if she jumped out the bassinet?
Joe I’m not kidding…|Hit me, hit me.
Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.|Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.|Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
You did it!|Tracy Reilly
Where are you going?|Game's tomorrow night Joe.
Tough crib.|Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|Hello Michael.
I'll see you in the morning .|Mhm-mh!
|� So, you're a paleontologist, right?
Stop saying good night.|Okay.
Hello.|Hey.
Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...|Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
MIKE!!!|Yeah?
Don�t joke  with me, okay? I�m very, very upset right now.|Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
Ok.|Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law.  You're fun.|You need to fill out this form.
Nighty-night!|Bye, bye.
No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?|I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...
What...how is it going with Drake?|Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
You were my first kiss with Rachel?|You were my first kiss ever?
I just had a rough night.|Oh. Crab cake?
No, no! What I mean is, I hate going back to my apartment now... and partly because I live above a known crack den but... mostly because when I'm there, It's just, I really miss you. So.. do you want to move in together?|Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say "Hell yeah!"
Who's laughing now?|I know!
That’s it. That’s it.|Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.|Is it a good play?
Try feeding her again.|I already fed her.
Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary.|Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
So what? Don�t you have any will power?|Will power? I�ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs  without taking the tin foil off.
Oh, crap!|Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?|No!
... is it weird that it's not with each other?|Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
So, you’re not going to Paris.|No, I’m still going.
Oh. Oh, thanks.|And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...|Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller
No, but come on, we’re off to a great start aren’t we? I knew I’d get you here fast, but this has got to be some kind of a record!|Oh you made it!
It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.|: Ross?
Oh, Come on!|Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going to make excellent parents.|LAURA!
Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.|Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?
Great!|So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..|We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
That's great! You changed you name?|Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
Ah, yeaaah!|DO YOU?
Can I adopt you?|Hey, you must be Owen.
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.|Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
Ok.|Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Oh.|and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy.
Her name is Deliah.|Oh, that's pretty.
Hi!|Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
|Who the hell was that?!
Okay.|Thank you.  Thank you!
Fifth day's a charm.|Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
You tricked me to get me into bed?|That�s right, I got mine.
Julie’s cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that’s about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.|Have you felt Rachel’s cervix Ross?
Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.|But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
Who, who are they?|I know them from work.
Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.|Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.|What? That's terrible!
Sex! This is the last day I�m ovulating, and when we don�t do it now, we�ll have to wait till next month.|You serious?
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?|Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.|Yeah, it's fun .
What?|How could you not remember that we slept together?
See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.|Break up with Charlie!
O-oh my God!|What?
I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.|
I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.|It’s a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, I’m sure you’re wondering why I didn’t get you an audition for that TV movie.
Alice would never go for it, right?|Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.|My kid's in a play right now.
No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".|Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!|Stinky?!
Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!|Are you wearing two belts?
Hey!|Hey!
Son of a gun, it is!|Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
You could say: "Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?"|Ready to go?
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.|Where is she?
Ooh, I want one...|Me too...
...and head to Canada!|I was kidding.
It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?|Excuse me?
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa|I'm sorry I didn't catch.
She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?|Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
|Hey!
After all, my parents died very young.|And my cholesterol’s off the charts!
Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?|Oh, they�re both exclus�
"I need an answer now!"|"Alright, here, you want an answer… the answer… is…"
Yeah, I'm serious.  It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!|Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.|Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?
Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...|Not to mention the cold sores.
YAY!|Shhh!
Hey, Rachel!!|Oh!
Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.|What? You - you're making money off my misery?
Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!|You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I�m gonna take off.|What?
Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you�re right. I think � listen, listen!|Ubb.
Oh, sorry.|Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.
Molly ... people don't study acting ...|Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?|Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
There isn't a piano here.|That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?|Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!|So? What do you think?
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|On a bell please! Quietly.. and ACTION!
Well, uh...|Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you like to make love to me?
Damnit!|Hey!
Okay.|Alright.
NO BIG DEAL!|It's so not a big deal!
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!|Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
Where you going, Joe?|For a walk.
What?|OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.|No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
of course she has. if she'd never had a serious relationship I'd go round broadcasting it like some unstoppable moron.|but you did say it
You were going to cut me out?|Well...kinda.
Not so much.|Okay.
Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.|Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
That bastard taped over me!|Is that a problem?
Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?|Good, good, life is good...
Eh, you work for that.|Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.|Oof...
It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It means...|Chandler?
Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!|Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.
And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!|Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
Joey, we know that's you.|no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
I am scrappy.|Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.
Rachel used to live in that room.|Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Oh my God!|And it is annoying when parents put their baby on the phone...
Yeah!|It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.|Ah.
If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.|Seriously?
Yes, hi!|James Campbell...
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Okay.
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.|Next time, can I say breathe?
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!|Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
Who is he?|Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Hey...|Hey!
Sure, I know lots of girls.|Yeah? Any names come to mind?
I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.|Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
Hello.|Hello
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.|Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.|Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?|Why? Who’d you seen him with?
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!|I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.|Really?
But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all, Rach.|Dude, step up! I proposed.
Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.|Sure, nice.
|Hey
Ok!|And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
I can't do that!|He says he can't do that.
Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.|You're all set.
I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.|Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.|What do you mean?
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!|And tell them that in 2 weeks I will once again be a masseuse in good standing!
Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.|I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?
What?|Get over here!
Ha, oh, of course.|Thank you.
Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,|That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
Excuse me?|Miss? Please, sit down!
You ducked!!|I’m sorry! It was a reflex!
Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?|Who am I?
You're mean!|Oh, don't be such a baby!
Uhh. You are welcome.|You know what? Let�s not talk.
Alright!|But ehm...what is it not?
You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?|Professor Geller?
You need both hands for that?|Yeah, I kinda do.
Thank you for letting us see the house again.|And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
Oh, oh. . What is this?|It's a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it, so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there, you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!
Who's Nancy?|What's going on?
Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...|Goodbody!
It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!|Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
So, did you err... did you tell Ross?|Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!|Yeah, I know. Well... this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that, but do you have some place that you need to be right now?
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.|So, did you know Ross well?
What? What do you mean you know?|Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.
Do you think I'm someone else?|Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?|I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!|Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?|No, actually, see I had to pee, �cause I can�t use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?|What kind?
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.|Mrs Hannigan?
Oh that’s terrible. I’m-I’m really sorry.|Yeah.
Hi!|Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?
I dunno, well he got over the "We were on a break" thing really quickly.|Y’know I can’t even worry about that right now, cause I got the cutie little baby, oh I can’t believe how much I love her, I can’t get enough of her, like right now I miss her.  I actually miss her.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.|Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.|I know, right?  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!|Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.
Yeah, he had a paper route.|Yeah, he did!  Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
Uh... What can I do for you?|Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
Me.|Really?
What did you do to my mom?|Not her!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.|Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
Yes.|Then, I might as well � . Not really sure what to do now.
Do you have to go?|I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing
No, I arranged that...|Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|You're gonna be okay?
Listen, I need to ask you something. Ok, you know how my step dad's in prison.|Yeah.
Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...|Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
I wasn't. Let's get going!|Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.|Monica and Chandler's apartment.
What?  Why?|Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.
No I don’t.|A little bit.
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..|Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.|Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.|Huh ha ha!
Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.|I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...|Later! La...
Hi!|Hey!
Good weird?|Wonderful weird.
Ok, so... 1800 minus twelve is... one thousand, seven hundred and...|Six o'clock!
.|Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.
Hello?|I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.|I quit and you learn what I do?
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?|So this is what a stroke feels like.
I understand...|No, I'll do it.
Tell me who it is.|Joey!
Your place is just lovely.|Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.|They did?
So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?|Yeah. It's actually our first official date
Hey. Who’s that?|New people.
Oh, a wiseacre. . No, no, no, I understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano? Isn't that kind of unstable?|No more so than acting.
Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.� But um. . .|Then, can I have your number?
Um, can I come back in?|
Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy...|Hey!
I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!|But you are a liar.
Really?|Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  Now throw it away!|C'mon! This looks good!
Really? Wh-what's wrong?|I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!
Really? What happened?|Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?|Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?|No.
Calm ourselves?|No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
My fajitas!!|Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!|Yes, but the batteries...
But you obviously haven't.|How can I help you?
Uh-huh!|Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why don�t you, why don�t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then I�ll meet you there.|Oh-A.
Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.|Ah, and where is Joey?
Oh.|See what I mean . . .
Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly.|Hey sweetie.
Okay...|Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
No it is awesome!|Hi guys.
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.|Well, I just lost my erection.
Oh honey...|Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving.
Why not?|Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection.  Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.|Honey?
That's not really how it works.|Oh, how does it work?
I'm so sorry!|No, I'll be fine... I just should check the stitches...
Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!|I didn't say anything yet!
I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.|Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Hey!|Hey! Where's Mike?
Mmh... this cake is amazing!|My God, get a room!
Oooohh that’s interesting.|If you win, we give up the birds.
Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.|Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything
Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!|*Now* it feels like Christmas.
And a crappy New Year.|Here, here!
And... taped back together.|Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.
Oh, I hear divorce bells.|Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.
Where?|Mexico!
All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!|Monica, what is the matter with you?
I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.|Uh huh.
I'm dead?|And so young.
Hmm, yeah.  Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.|Mommy
Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?|Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.
Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!|Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
No, you're not! Last week you thought Ross was trying to kill you!|Well, I'm sorry but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull just to tell it!  See, there's something going on with them. Look, he's getting into the car with her!
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.|Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
Really? Like you have a routine?|No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?|How about at a game, on the big screen?
You guys ready to go?|Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
What? Oh my God! To who?|This guy! He has a killer apartment.
Good morning everyone, it�s nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions?  Yes, Ken is it?|That�s right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?|Yeah!
Wow. Where is your luggage?|Damn it!
Dude!|Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|I can't believe we are at a real college party!  I have to pee so bad!
But what?|This is kind of a classy place.
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.|Thank you?
It's because I'm scrappy.|Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.|You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!
That's right!|Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
It's a baby chick and duck!|Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?|Oh!  Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
Excuse me?|Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.
So... what do you say?|Are you kidding? Phoebe, I would be honored.
Oh.|I hate my parents.
Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?|Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
You can't have it.|Give it to me!
I thought it was Ross.|So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
Your first marriage?|Yeah.
I just have one question!|Shoot!
You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?|Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm...  Only... only not creepy.
I think you know.|I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
No!|A little bit more.
Oh, around 8:30?|Yeah.
Uh, actually, that's..|Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
|Hey!
Oh my God!|And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat!
God, I wish Mike were here.|Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
Yeah... Now I have something...|I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
So, why did you break up?|Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.
I’m in the middle…|Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.|I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .|Excuse us!
Oh, ok, thank you.  Do you see what all the guys see in her?|Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!
Come on, I don't know what else to do.|Fine, fine.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!|Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.|Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.|Good morning!
What happened to the Disgustingtons?|They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.|Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps".  Would you help me try to sell these?
Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.|I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
Wow! So, how are you?|I'm, I'm okay.
I know, yeah!|And first, I have to see the MET!
This is nice.|I know!
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|You got me a cola drink?
Hey, y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this!|Actually it’s more like this.
Why didn�t I get that message?|What?
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with.  Hey!
I have to break up with Charlie?|Hey, you got one right!
I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.|Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."|He isn't?!
Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!|Oh, really!
Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.|Yeah, maybe.
Wh… wh…what?|When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?
And you’re Okay with that?|Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello?  I’m fine.
What?!|Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.
Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.|No I told you I can't.
I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.|Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?|A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
Hey!|Hey!
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!|Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
Oh good, you haven't left yet.|Where have you been?
Sure.|Would you stop staring at her?
|Kevin Bright
Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?|Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
Why not?|Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|Why don't I show you the baby's room?
I've nothing to say to you.|You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
No, it starts with a silent "M".|Oh come on!!
Nothing. It's fine.|Oh thank God!
What?|Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!|Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
Hey guys! Dinner's ready!|Oh! I'm gonna go wash up first.  Thanks!
What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s so inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is bigger than mine!|I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
With the circus? He's behind the elephant.|Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?
Yeah, I guess!|I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.|Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.
I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?|Maybe he didn't give you a chance.
Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!|Awesome, the name really stands out.
Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.|Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.|Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
|Ooh, not so tight...  I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...|Monica!
Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps?  Aunt Margaret's pants size?|I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.
Oh my God!|I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.
Two!|Two!
Hands.|Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating him for years!
Good, God's speed, good people!  You're not gonna go?|Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.|Okay. Excuse me...
Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it look like?!|I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of it.
I don’t know. What do you think?|I think we should.
"No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!|Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth
Ohhhh! These seats are great!|I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
I guess not.|I can't believe you thought I was cheating.�  You own me an apology.
Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.|Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! .
Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!|Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?
It's a Speedo.|...Oh crap!
So you're not friends with him?|OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No!
Well, I�ll tell you what we�re gonna do: We are already late for Phoebe�s birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, we�re gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.|Fine. What!?
A place to eat spaghetti.|Very good!  What do you need it for anyway?
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|Every year.
Oh. Ah-uh.|A widower.
What?|Why not?
Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!!  Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...|You're not gonna need my help?
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  Ow!|You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
We’re so lucky.|We really are.
I'm crazy about her.|And she feels the same way?
OH MY GOD!|You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
I guess, in time.|Yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's true.|Uh, I haven't.
Oh, Bob, get off the guy!|Oh! What a game, huh?
What?|There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?|Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.|: I cannot tell you how happy that makes me!
What if he reads it in the paper?|Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
What happened?|Who cares, AND?
Je m'appelle Claude.|Je te flouppe Fli.
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?|No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
Ooh, that was fast.|Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
So did I|Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
I know, but I’m a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.|Dr. Wells is a woman.
Hey you guys!|Hey!
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.|Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Thank you.|But I am going hunting!!
Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...|You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?|Sure!
your ass?!?!?|Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
I'm sure you have better things to do.|Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|Oh, I don’t think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.
You never cooked since 1996.|Is the window open? Because if there�s a window open, a bird could fly in there.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!|Hi, glad you could come.
*What*??|Well, she... she didn't win...
I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.|You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.
And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um…I didn’t propose to you.|I know.
Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.|"To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.|Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?
Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!|Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!
Yes.|Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Okay!|I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
My dear, sweet Rach.|Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.|Female body inspector? What size is that?
Going go to the bathroom.|Well, I think you should wait.
Sex!|Seriously, answer faster!
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.|And Joey?
What-what?|Ow! Ow! Contraction.
No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.|What?
Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.|Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.|It's all right. You can mourn.
Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don't see it, do you see it?|No, did we miss it?
That really was an incredible wedding.|It was, yeah. I kind of don't want it to end. Hey, you wanna come in for a drink and a bite of corsage?
I'm sorry, idea time is over.|Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
I didn't.|Oh really?
Yeah. Why?|Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?|Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
I wouldn't say never, you know there's that guy  ok well there's gotta be someone.|There isn't that's what I'm saying.
What!?|This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
I'm sorry man.|But, ehm... you watched the tape?
So?|So I don’t wanna be just anybody.
Oh, good for you!|I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
No, that seems about right.|Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
Congratulatioooons!|Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.|I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.|What? Whoo... What?
I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  I'm sorry...!|OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
Occupation? Dinosaurs.|Actually I’m a palian… Dinosaurs is fine… the drawing is not.
I'm sorry.|I'm sorry too.
I hope Ross isn't too upset.|I'm sure he's not more bummed out than I am.
She's mine!|She's mine!
Oh my God.� I can't believe you live in that building.� My grandmother lives in that building.� Ida Green?� No sense of personal space?� Kind of smells like chicken?� Looks like a potato.|"Spuds" is your grandmother?
OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?|Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..|I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie!  Come, please come in. Come in.
Of course, I'd be honored!|Thanks!
So... how many guys have your key?|No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
Okay, hold on a sec.|Period math?
You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him|You're welcome.
Ross, say something. Anything.|So you two are..?
Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?|Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced.� Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?|Yeah.� � Yeah, I'm sorry.� I don't . . . I don't really like to talk about it.
Mike and I broke up.|You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?|No. I was just going to do this myself.
well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.|hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?|Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.
Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid.|Oh, is that so? Ok. If that's really what you want, then here... I give you the headset. Well, I don't really want to give you the headset. Well I guess if you're taking over, you should probably return these messages.
I am those things, yeah.|You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Spend more time with the tie. That�ll make a baby.|Look, I can�t do this. I can�t make luv to you while we�re fighting this way.
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever|OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Do we have a name yet?|No, not yet.
No, no, no!|But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
Heeey!|Hi!
What, oh my God. What did you do?|Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
