Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?|Are you serious?
I hope you were using protection.|� Excuse me.� Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
Really? What's that like?|It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.|Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...|No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?
Hello?|Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?
Really? Even more humiliating than…|Hey, let's not do this!
Baby got back|One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...
Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?|Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!|No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know
Okay.  Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...|Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...|What?
No! No, you know what?|I was just going to say that I left my keys.
Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three.|Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Oh God.|... she's being unreasonable!
So, you just let her go?|Yeah.
Why?!!|Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.
Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!|Well, I've never gone this fast before.
How late are we?|Forty-five minutes.
Ooh, Joey.|Hey.
Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?|Huh.
Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.|Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
Hey, Zack!|Hey Chandler.
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.|Oh, please, we're happy to help.
Ah! I missed you|Oh, me too!
Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?|I’m so sorry.
You broke the pact!|Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!|Okay mister! Fertilize me!
God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.|Pie eating contest?
She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.|So fellas
What did you get?|USA Today
Hey! Remember when I had corneas?|Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
We don't.� But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.� You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.|Oh that's so cute:� Ross and Mike's first date.� Is that going to be awkward?� I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?|Good, good yeah,  "Oops."
Great novels?|Fine ... mediocre porn
That’s crazy! . I am sorry. I just can’t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!|We, you know, we’re different! We don’t care about having a huge party.  All right, well, who cares, I don’t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
Why? What was it?|That I was going to eat him.
Hurry!|Good luck, good luck!
...kiss him?|Oh, well, yeah...
But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!|You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
You might want to keep practicing.|Yah.
What are you doing?|Oh, you'll see my friend.
That's alright. Listen, listen.|Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
You slept out here?|Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling ‘Myron, get off!’
You said you’d marry Joey?|Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married!  I’m not helping.
Morning, roomie!|Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!|well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer
Oh!|Joey. Erica, baby!
Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?|No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?|Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.
Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.|Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.|Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
Yeah?|Yeah.
I don’t think you do.|You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.
Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.|Phoebe!
Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if… You’re wearing the ring.|Wh-what’s that?
No! Stop!|Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
Alright, who wants to do it?|Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
Look at you with all the guys!|Yeah!
Hey Rach.|Yeah.
That's a, that's a long time.|You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!|Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.|Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.
Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?|Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights.
Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?|No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.
I'm there!|We'll see you, guys!
Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.|I'll be right back.
You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.|Ah?� � Do you have one here?
No, what's he like?|Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?|Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
I'll let you get acquainted.|Ok.
What!?|Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!|Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
Whoa, whoa.� Wait a minute.� Wait a minute.� If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?|I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
Hey!|Hey.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.|Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
Wow! You look like... like my mom.|I'm wearing pantyhose!
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.|Ross...
: he has to work, there's some rush on the big  ah damn it one of these days I'm really gonna have to start listening when he talks about his job.|oh why don't you fly out there and surprise him.
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.|Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Uhuh.|Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
Still you know, a girl calls you by your ex-boyfriend's name, that-that's not a good thing, right?|David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.
Good? Didn�t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That�s is the best gift ever.|Also a good gift? Underwear.
Joey.|I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!|Rach, she’s got like three hairs!
Oh!|Look at Emma!
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?|Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.|Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
Okay.|You can take some caster oil, there’s eating spicy foods…
Really?|Yeah.
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.|Ooh... Dr. Geller!
You got it.|All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...|What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
Sorry!|Well this is romantic!
Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.|Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?|Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!|It does?
All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.|Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
Toll-booth.|What?
Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.|Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.|Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was the youngest.|Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.|What are you saying?
So uh…I guess we should…make it official huh?|Uh… Look Rach… Hey Ross is here! Hey look! It’s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.
Really?|Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?|You could do that?
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Uh.
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!|You liked it? You really liked it?
Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this "best wishes" crap. I want "love".|Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.
You can�t order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.|Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there�s still some food left on their place, okay, what�s the restaurant�s policy about people eatin� that?
Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.|The job is in Paris.
Ok, I don’t wanna be negative so I’ll say that most of the signs you bought are good.|No they ran out of "It’s a girl" but I can fix this one,  See?
It's ok, it's ok. You know what?|Okay good.
Oh, of course...|Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped|I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!|Well, what was it?
So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?|Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.
All right.|All right.
Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y’know, sexually?|No!
A MONTH??|What the... DIAL IT DOWN!  Ok, dial it up a little!
I love you.|I love you guys.
I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?|Oh, because his penis was too big.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.|Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Oh, really?|No!  You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
Because patience is the road to understanding  which ... is the key... to a happy heart.|You blow me away.
Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?|Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!|Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...|Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.|I like that poster!
I'm the hell person whose office this is!|Good one, Rach.
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.|Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can�t contain my breasts.|This is not, what I�m wearing. I�m ovulating and Chandler�s gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Hi.|Hi.
You're a pig. And you can't do this.|Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
|FYI..
What is it? Hey!|Really it’s nothing. I’m just…
Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.|No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.
Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.|I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.|Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
What do you mean?|Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.|Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine!  Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!|That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Oh, good!|Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
Yeah!|I've always wanted to live with a guy. "Pick up your socks!" "Put down the toilet seat!" "No! We're not having sex anymore!" It's gonna be fun!
Hmmm-mmmm.|Not even one more time?
You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.|Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
Make it fifty!|I'll make it a hundred!
Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?|It can be anything you want.
And done!|Oh my God! I didn�t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles around
Ja!|You know I...
What?|Joey proposed to me.
I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.|Oh, that’s very—Really very-very okay.
Hey!|Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
That’s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.|Oh no no no no!
Alright, okay, so we can all go now. That is fun. Hey, you know what? We all haven�t been together the six of us in such a long time.|What are you talking about? We�re all together right now.
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.|I'm really happy for you guys.
Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...|I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.
Hey guys!|Hey!
Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?|I really don't.
Puerto Rican.|Two, I think a two.
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.|I know
Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!|He's the boss's son.
Sure.|Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Hey!|Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Damn super cuts!|what's up is Phoebe ok?
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you’re gonna get together right?|I don’t think that we are.
I'm gonna go.|Why??
Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.|I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
Hey honey! I missed you today!|Oh, yeah?
...Valentine's day...|Oh yeah!
No!|Hit me! Hit me!
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...|YEAH!
Original.|No, sorry haven't seen him.
That's the perfect amount!|Okay!
Ooh, and treat it is.|Hmhmm.
now I feel terrible this is all my fault.|well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.|But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?|Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Wow, it really is!
Aww!|Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?|Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up?
Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!|Also so gay!
What?|Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
Hi!|Hey!
Oh, mon Dieu!|Oh, de fuff!
Which one, they all suck!|The museum!
But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!|You didn't watch the tape.
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?|Shana Goldberg-Meehan & Scott Silveri
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.|No, it wasn't.
Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!|Oh my god, you're right!
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?|
Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...|Oh! Oh, no!
Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.|Right. And with who again?
Hi!|Hey!
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!|What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?|Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
I want to stay too but I've gone as bad as much use out of these boxers as I can..|Why don't you turn them inside ou...
What's going on?|I'm sorry.� I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . .� I didn't think you'd understand.
Then what's that big lump under your covers?|It's Monica, ok?
|WOW!
Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.|Oh, really?
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.|The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. <whiny voice> And they all got to meet Santa!
Not until you said it. Somebody switch!  Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.|That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.|Tell me more.
Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?|Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.|Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.
Ooh...|Just the crab cakes.
Dessert?|Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or.... No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.|Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
Yeah?|Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
I got bottled breast milk.|Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum...  There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.|Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.|Finish it!
Oh, thanks.|But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
Really? I don't really feel like it.|This is what I want to do.
Hey!|Hey! Got champagne?
Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.|Seriously? She actually said that?
Hey Phoebe!|Hey!
Who cares, it got you here.|Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
Hey!|18th and East End.
Okay. Oh, yeah...  Oh he's cute!|So... your resumé is quite impressive.
Okay. Here goes.|What's the matter?
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?|You said that to me last week.
Just a second.|No, no, no, no, no.� Joey can't know that I'm here.
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this.|What are you singing?
I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...|Feel me up?
Hi|Listen, I think I've left something here.
|You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?|Oh, absolutely!
Well, the club lost it's power.|Yeah according to the news, most of the city did.
Well do you love him?|Sure.
Yeah.|Hello.� � Okay, "Bill from the bar."� I'll make sure she gets your number.
Yeah, I guess.|So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?|No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.
What's going on?|: sweetie it's ok, I still love you, let me be a part of this.
I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...|Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;|Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
Oh.|Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|
Ah, Claudia, aren�t you supposed to blow smoke up the bosses� ass?|I�m sorry. Does the smoke bother you?
Honey, you�re just in time, I�m about to sing another song!|Really? In front of all this people?
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?|No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...|Oh no, I want to.
I am Mike.|Atta boy!
Hey!|Hey Pheebs.
Ok, careful.|Ok.
I'm sorry, what?|Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
Chandler? I was just in our bedroom and I found these  on my pillow.|Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?|We weren't doing anything!
What are you doing here?|Phoebe called me.
Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.|FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound.  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.|So where did you study?
through the glass doors.|Through the glass doors.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!|I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.
Oh!|"She never loved me, she only loved you."
It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...|Oh... what an interesting name.
Ken, please! No, I can�t, I can�t smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.|I�m sorry, but isn�t your wife back in New York?
Oh, good for you.|She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
We need to talk to you about something.|Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Dr. Wiener.|Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
Okay!|Wow! You are really fast!
You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.|Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
no it's not ringing any bells.|my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?|SON OF A BITCH!  (To the
Hey!|Hi!
You sure you're alright?|Yep.
I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.|Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.|Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
What are those?|I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!
Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up.  Look Emma, look who's baaack!|Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|They went in together. So sorry.
Alright. My job here is done.|That was... Impressive.
You can open your eyes now.|Are we off the bridge?
Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?|Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?|Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.|Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
I am not doing this over the phone.|You don't have any other choice!
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!|C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Chandler!|I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!
You wanna fool around with Joey?|Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!
Oh ok.|I am on fire!
Me too. Come here.|I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Why not? It's brilliant!  Thank you, Chandler. Sincerely.|Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.
Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.|Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
I don't want to look at your file! This is over.|Erica wait!
Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.|Yes, doctor.
Insane.|I know.
Just flip!|Ha, tails!
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.|Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  but I do have something for you.
That's not Monica!|Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.|Did I go to this school?
Hey!|Hey!
Hi.|Hey.
I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?|It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
Hello.  I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.|What?
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?|I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m dying.|Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again, it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife?� Huh?� Do you think I'm like, "Duh."�|Joey?
That was fun Pheebs.|I know.� That was fun.�
Uh!|Ok  Alright! Lets do it!
No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!|Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
I haven't been home in a couple of days and I need to get some more clothes.|Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.
Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.|But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
Humiliating and noble!|You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.
I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.|No awareness.
Oh my God! That’s the doctor who was in my room before!|Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?|I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
Sure!|Ok.  Thank you for coming with me today.
Hi. We’re buying the house next door, and we were wondering if we could just take a look around.|Oh, sure. I’m showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
You've never turned?|No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.
I am sorry! Again... I don't know, I don’t know what happened, I must be nervous!|I don’t get it, Chandler loved it!
AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright...  Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!|Robert Carlock
Ah! The high road...|You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...|Yeah, that'll do it.
It's a science.|Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
So?|[It�s just] So spooky, that�s all.
|Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?|Nope...
You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.|That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
Hey!|Hey!
Okay.|So, eight days late huh?
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|Oh my God.  Hello?
No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it...|So...? What do you think?
All right, all right.|I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea.
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?|Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
There's the man I married!!|All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.|Oh my God!!
I'm *happily* married.|Oh. - What's *that* like?
"I need an answer!"|"I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know."
You've never said that in your life, have you?|Not once.
How did you know that?!  Joey! Chandler!! It’s time!|They’re at the coffeehouse.
Have you seen him throw a ball?|Is Rachel here?
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...|So basically all nuts?
Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.|Yeah, I guess you're right.
Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.|All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.|Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding.
Yeah.|You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.|Why are they doing this?
You're fly is open, Geller!|You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Sure, what do you have in mind?|I think you know.
Oh thank you so much.|Thanks.....
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?|Excuse me.
Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!|Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.
But then how do we know who wins?|Nobody wins!
I'm sorry too...|ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.|I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
Is that it?|No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading  Finding your G-spot.
All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica|Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
Really, really not.|Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.
All the appliances are included. There is a lot of light, a new kitchen... I think you guys would be very happy here...|No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.
Yeah.|So hi!
Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.|I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
We're just making conversation.|Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
No.|Oh really!?
Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...|We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
Yeah.|Ok. See you, bye.
Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.|Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.|Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit.  You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.|So, what are you gonna do?
Were you there?|No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.|You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
Whoa! You were down on one knee?|Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!
Oh, he has a gig. I kinda like being married to a rock star, you know. My husband has a gig.|Yeah? Yeah, where is it?
I….can’t….believe this!|And yet somehow it’s true!
Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!|Phoebe!!
We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...|Oh, that is so tacky.
I'll watch her.|Why would you do that?
That was going to be my next argument.|Hey!
Oh, is that you?|No!
Give me the bag.|No, look, I don’t know what else to do. I said I’m sorry!
I think I hear curtains closing...|We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.|Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose!  Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.
Get out of the cab!|Get out of the cab!
Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.|Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
Hey.|Hey. I need to tell you something.
Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.|What are you gonna do?
What?|Newark airport. Why, where are you?
Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.|Hey!
Uh-hmm.|You guys are gonna come and visit me, right?
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?|Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?|I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
Oh, hey Joey.|Uh, hey.
Ross?|Ross?  Can we just close the door?
Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not  Phoebe...|Got it! It... It's hard to stop...
Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.|Hi!
No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.|No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
Oh! They're in the table!|Well, that can't be good!
Yeah, I'm sorry. I really am.|Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule.  Oh, can't you make an exception?"
Work, Joe!|Damn it!
Oh hey! Wait up!|Hi!
What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!|oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.
Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.|But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.|Hey dad!
Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.|Incidentally, when are you coming back?
She's asleep.|Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
Here she comes!|She? It's a girl?
Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.|It’s sex.
pelle|pel.
But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.|Joey, I can’t do that!
Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.|Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
Are you trying to tell me that we’re moving to Oklahoma, or that you’re gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?|No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus.  I’ll get out of it.
Good!|Keep pushing!
OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.|Thank you.
OH NO!|What? What is it?
A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.|Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.|Oh my God! What did you say?
Hey|Hey. So where's Mon?
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...|Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying...  Stop lying!
You said that was sexy!|�kay, look: Can we just drop this? I�m not gonna smoke again.
Eww!|Well, what happened?
Right.|I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?  Not easy.
Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.|Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?� � I heard it.
It could be Amanda!|Oh, you’re right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!
You got two more twos?|I'm an eight!
Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?|Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...
Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.|Thank you, I think so too.
You're late!|I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
I’m a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.|I’m 33.
Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?|Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Ah actually we don’t.|Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I didn’t even do anything wrong.
I have to go to the bathroom.|I have to go scream into a pillow.
I was in the car with Nancy all day.|Nancy doesn’t smoke!
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!|Great!
Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.|Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...|Oh, that would be great!  I love him, I love him, I love him...
Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.|Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?
After you, miss Banana Hammock.|Thank you, mister Bag.
Me too.|Wait a minute, I know why I'm being such an ass, why are you?
I put that tube top on as a joke.|I want you to stay.
She's still at dinner?|I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.|
Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.|Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?|Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.
Hi!|Hi!
I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.|Ross, nice to meet you.
That was a good day!|They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.|Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
I’m gonna go.|No, come on Ross!  Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?|Oh please, he’ll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
What are you taking amoxicillin for?|How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�s
What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?|Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!
I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.|Obviously.
Uhm, right!|...It's kinda hard though!
Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.|I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
Yeah.|I love ya.
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.|You're on!
Well, we could start trying. Now.|Right here?
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.|What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh?  I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
That-that’s him! You know him?|Okay. Okay. I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.
Oh uh, up or down?|Oh down please.
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.|Ah, look who’s back!  Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
Miss? Are you boarding the plane?|Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
Hurry!|Okay!
Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?|Yeah...
Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!|If I haven't said so already sir,  congratulations!
I said it's still nap time.|Hey, there is uncle Joey!
Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.|Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this!  Ok. Aha! You like that huh?
Ok.|Here we go. Stand up straight.
Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!|You may want to lose the foam finger!
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!|Please, you're going down!
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!|...Missy?
ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!|I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
Then don't go!|Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
What are you doing?|Putting on the sneakers… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything…
Why, I must have been in missile training the day they taught that.|Just subtract twelve.
... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...|Erectus?
My name in Mike, and I do play piano.|Prove it.
Your boarding pass, please.|Oh.
Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.|And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!|So? Do you think we should get it?
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Oak, maple, elm, birch...
Hey!|Hey...
Ehm... Her name is Emma.|Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!
What?!|Monday?!
Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.|Oh, you're going to Minsk?
Chandler gets pedicures!|Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
What?!!|I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.
Oh my God!|Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!
What? You know about the plate thing?|Oh, yeah. Joey doesn’t share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and ...
Oh right, uhm, Don?|Close. Ron.
Wow, you catch on quick.|Well, I have a PhD, so...
It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.|Oh my God!
'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?|No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
Oh y’know what? You have to speak very loudly when you’re talking to Sid, because he’s almost completely deaf.|Oh!
Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that’s…|Do you want a calculator?
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.|So, how dark is it gonna get?
Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.|Really? The scientist guy?
Hey.|Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.|Ok, how about this ?
Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.|Ok!
It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.|Was it really that bad?
And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.|Okay.
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?|Original or crappy?
What are you doing?|Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
Hey!|Hi!
Hey, finished my recommendation.  Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.|I don’t... uh... understand.
Ok!|Oh my God! You're good!
I�m starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.|What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
What?|Ten centimeters, you’re about to become a mom.
Hi...|Is everything allright?
Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.|Too little, too late, Benji!
...I hate waste.|...Ross?
Your ex-boyfriend?|Yeah.
Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.|The Divorcer, to the rescue!
Alright, lo�look. I don�t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it�s fine.  So you all smoke then? That�s almost rude, that I�m not.|That�s not true. If you don�t wanna smoke �
Why? What's the big deal?|Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?|uhu uhu, check this out.
Je m'appelle!|Me pooh pooh!
Really?|Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
No, hey, it's been great.|Yeah?
Uh!|Zack!
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.|David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Yeah.|Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.|Look at them! Aw. I love you so much.  Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
You gotta see these latest pictures of Emma.|Oh, how cute!
We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.|Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Hey!|Hey!
What? What's the matter?|What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!|Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!|Hi!
Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.|Really?! Even Ross?
what a great dinner.|yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?|These are amazing!
Thanks so much for showing me around.|Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?|No...
Ohh. Oh wait!  you guys won�t be late for my dinner, will you?|Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. We�ll probably be the first ones there.
Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really.|Yeah! But you said not to worry about...
What you got?|Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
I think so.|Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
I love you!|I love you too!
Nooo!|Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.|Okay.� You too.� And I hope you score.�  Bye.
Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.|Oh my God! That's wild!
Oh man! I have to get those done too?!|Wow! Talking about high maintenance
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.|Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
Oh. This was amazing.|It really was. You've learned some new moves!
Best out of three?|That's what I'm thinking.
No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.|You're not serious, right?
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I don't want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying that I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!|You can see where he'd have trouble.
Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.|Well...
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.|Oh!
Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.|Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
Thank you!|That's like a woman wanting to be a...
Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.|Joey, you're so sweet.
Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?|Ok, let’s work from the top down!  Just work the bra, Joe!
: yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend|how come?
…she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.|Yeah.  Why aren’t you with Rachel?
No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.|Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
Hey, Missy...|You know, our band is playing on Friday.
Welcome home.|� Oh well, look at you.
Should we send something?|How did the job stuff go?
Hey, where have you been?|Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
Here goes...|I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!|Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Doctor Connelly just called.|With good news?  "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.|Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Oh sure.�|Oh my God, you're giving your real number.
I really, really am sorry.|How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?
No.|Okay.�
Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!|I’m sorry, I can’t!
Oh that’s five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn’t she want to come out?|Y’know what I think it is? I think you’ve made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn’t want to leave.
Hey!|Hey!
Actually, I just gave up my practice.|What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
There isn't. There is totally isn't.|You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a
Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!|Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?|Are you asking permission to break the pact?
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!|I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
Ok if everyone’s on board, it’s settled, Chandler,  Chandler?|Yep.
Don't tear it.|Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
I don't even know what that's for.|You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.|So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??|Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! .
Ok, we're still on that.|I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?|That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.
I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?|I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.|Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?
What? You are way off, lady!|Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!|Ugh, Let's just cut her out!
I'd love to.|Great.
Actually I did it Ross. You remembered shockingly little of your own speech.|Yes, but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products. This is amazing, thank you, thank you so much.  That's a pretty necklace.
Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!|Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what…|Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...|Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.
I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!|Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.
You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is over seven pounds.  I bet you it’s a girl.|We know it’s a girl!
Wh-what's going on?|Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?|I know.
Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!|Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?|Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Well, I was probably going to do it at some point.|I didn't mean now...
Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.|I understand.
Then, again at 9:00?|uh-huh.
Hey!|Hey!
So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?|I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
Oh... That's true.|Thank you!
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.|Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
Listen, I um… I heard about the engagement.|Surprised?
I, I have to go before I put your head through a wall.|. Pooh.
Hiccups.|Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
I'm on it!|Anything?
The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.|Mmm-mm.
Oh... oh...|Yeah, I should have told you.
Oh God, Ross.� Ross is going to pick up the phone.� Oh, I have to get my number back.� � Oh my God.� He's gone.|Dead on.
I'm not supposed to tell you.|I'm not supposed to tell you!
Why not?|Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
Aaah.�|So, ah . . . So, how was it?�� Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have a good time?
Love it!|Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.|Yeah, me too.
I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.|Oh I’m sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh.   Shhh! Go back to sleep
Well, actually it...|No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
You didn't hear the speech!|I've heard the speech:  "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... "
Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer...  Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!|You are!  Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!|Yeah, but so is this.
I’m not gonna hit you.|Why not?  You’ll feel better!  I’ll feel better, and you know you want to. I can see it in your eyes.
Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t think you’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh?|I still can’t believe it! I’m the luckiest guy in the world!
Yeah it is.|What the hell are you doin'?
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.|Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...|Phoebe you don't have to eat...
� Why do I smell men's cologne?|I think that's you.
Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!|Well, it matters to me!
Hey Rach, do you feel like going to a convention?|We can't. We're not pharmacists!
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|Oh thank god, if Phoebe�s going, can we please take Emma home?
Haha, no thanks!|That was a nice pep-talk.
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|This can not be happening!
...If-you-say-so.|So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take
Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.|We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
Yeah... it's almost definitely him.|How's that now?
Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?|What the hell are you talking about??
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!|Yeah, yeah, oh!
That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.|Huh. What's Tag's last name?
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...|Get to the problem!
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?|What?!
Well, I took it.|That's great! So you're staying in New York!
I know.|I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.
Nice to meet you.|H-Hi!! And you are...?
Oh!  Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?|Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.|Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the plate and more seriously> Woah.
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|Hey guys.
Scary pigeon's back?|It's huge.
Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.|I just can't believe this... Why?
Now Gene I must remind you, you need all six of these to stay in the game, all right? Describe for Joey things you find in your refrigerator.|Ahaha, he might as well just give us the points.
Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?|Isn't that cute?
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?|About a week and a half.
Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.|Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there...|Yeah...
Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!|I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing.  What, he's my favourite author!
Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!|Who...?
Yeah.|It's his dad.
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."|Hear me out woman.� I'll go down the fire escape.� Then, I'll wait for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|So, what did you decide?
You kissed.|Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?|No, I sat in the paint.
What, what.|Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...|Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.|All right.� I've got a plan.� I'll go down the fire escape.
Rach, he just saw us.|Shhh.
oh it was great.|: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I.  have a little surprise for you.
So do you think that my dream means anything?|I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.|And I love Crap.
Uh-huh.|What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog!  Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
Bet she'd sleep with you now...|No... I already e-mailed her.
Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?|Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it.
I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!|So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
So, let's do this.|I - I don't think I can.
What's Emma doing today?|Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
Uh-huh.|You guuuyys.
I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?|Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!|Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.|You do attract some stinkers.
Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. . Can’t believe it's been a whole year!|I know. This has been the best year...  THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
Yeah.|Comb my eyelashes.
Hey.|Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.|Is he really?
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Hey uh, where do you guys want this?
See you guys.�|Rachel, lock the door.� Lock the door,� seriously.
Wha... what do you mean?|It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
NO! No, no!|YES!
Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.|You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
Chandler, I don’t even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!|Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.|It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
Give me the bag.|No, hit me
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.|Rach, she's not going to remember this.
Hey, where's Rachel?|She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...|YES! Sandy you're hired.
Okay.|Okay, you ready?
Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?|Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
The whole thing! Can we go?|Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
Wow, this place looks great.|Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!|Wow!
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!|Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!|Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.
Previously on Friends...|How did the job stuff go?
What?|Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.
Oh stupid metric system!|Oh my. We’re gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Hi, Mike's place.|Hey, it's Mike.
Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.|Well, let's just go in there and face them.
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.|Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
I'm not always that bad!|Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.|Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.|There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.|That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.|Nice to meet you.
Dead.  Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.|Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?|Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.|Really? If that's what you want...
: how do you know I have one of those?|didn't till just now.
Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...|My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
That's how old you are.|Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.|Nooo!
On...?|On how far along he's in the sex change process!
But do you wanna get back together?|I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
I don't know.� Do I have to decide right now?|Well, you kind of just did.� That guy is going to call you tonight.� Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?|Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.
I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?|I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.
Eva Trorro... womba...|Kate Miller?
Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.|So you're gonna be gone four days a week?  No.
Cheers.�|You know, it's funny.� I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.� � Hi ya.
What did I just say?|You still here?
That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!|It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
How can you come here?|How could you not tell me you worked here?
Are you serious?|If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?|There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
What harpist? My friend Marjorie is playing the steel drums.|Ooh... she backed out.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.|That bad?
Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.|Go away! I don't want to see anybody.
Oh yeah, I'm jealous. "Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass".  Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.|I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.
Hey, Charlie!|Hey.
Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.|That’s true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!
Oh please, hit by a blimp?|It kills over one americans every year.
You can really arrange that?|You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.
OH!|Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
See?|Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".
Oh my God, are you okay?|I recently had surgery.
You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!|Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.|Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
Oh, I didn't go to college.|No, where did you study acting?
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".|um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?|Hmm-hmm.
Why, why would you open it?|Well, it didn't say "This is a virus"!!
Hey.|Hey.
I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!|Really?
Hey, here you go.|Ooh... oooh...  Can I ask you a question?
Alright, so that leaves Chandler.|Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
That�s right, because I forbid you to smoke again.|You forbid me?
But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.|What have you heard me sing?
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.|Okay.
Oh my God!|Unbelievable!
Uh, Joe?|Damn it!
Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.|Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin!|
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!|3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
You stepped on my egg roll?|I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.|Really? I’ve been dealing with Dr. Wells.
Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!|Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
Mom no, come on! Thank you.|Just hear me out!
Glad I could help man.|Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but...  I made it work.
Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?|I am happy.
People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin|Don't be. It's just bad timing.
Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.|What do you think brought than on?
Okay.|Okay.
Yes, she jumped right back up.|Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
Hey guys!|Hey, let me tell them!
And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,|Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...|Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
All the time when you're cooking.|What?
How was your date with Joey?|Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
Yeah. All right, now give me your best shot.|All right, here it goes...
And the fireplace in the bedroom.|And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!|Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
Alright, who do you want as your emergency contact?|Ah, Rachel I guess.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Hey!
Huh? Ooh  you mean like a… Huh?|Ross, I know you’re pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…|Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.|Wrong number?
Oh... uh... look... before you...|No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
Trust me, I will never...|Yeah I get that.
It's an unpaid internship.|It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.|Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Gotcha.|Oh, Very funny... Joey.
They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?|Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
I... I'm Phoebe.|Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress.  Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!|Oh, .. uh... uh... pass.  Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
Ah, who is Emma?|I told you about my daughter.
Boston is down, Atlanta is down, Houston is down, I could go on and on but instead of boring you I’ll go straight to my forty two point plan.|Walter .
Seriously? You divorce-o?|If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
They're in a caaar...|Okay, we-we'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.
Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.|I know.
Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: "Oh, I knew all along"|I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
Here.|And now your cell.
Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!|Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
Is it an engagement ring?|Yes!
Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. .|Ah-haah! I win!!
You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!|Good for you Pheebs!
Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.|Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are.
Yeah.|I didn't know you guys hung out.
Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?|You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.
Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!|That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?|Are all the questions this personal?
Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...|And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a  HI!
Does that room have a closet I can lock him in?  We'll take it.|Great.
Two thousand dollars?|Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Phoebe did the signs!|Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
Wher-where have you been?|Well, we had a little fight.
I'm gonna take off now. You're gonna let me go home, aren't you?|You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.|Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
yeah well  yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.|that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
If you want to check your email, just ask!|May I?
Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else…|Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
yes, yes I did. and I will also say what I'm about to say Vis-�-vis the following Phoebe has never had a serious relationship since her. super-serious relationship with. Vicrum.|Vicrum?
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
No... well, yeah.|I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
So you lied to me before?|Well, we...  "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
Thank you.|Pheebs, spit that out, that has pork in it.
Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?|Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.|One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
How's it going?|Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
No-ot for me it doesn’t.|So, how’s everything going in here?
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.|You may wanna get some more of those too.
Sssshhhh!|Rachel?
Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?|Stop!
Yay!|Well what are we going to do?
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.|Hey, what's wrong?
Oh, ok, which one?|Uh, why, it’s a... . And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.
|Yeah, I see what you mean.� By the way, nice Ross imitation.
Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".|Wow. What does that mean?
Ok, yeah, got it.|Okay.
They...do that?|It's kind of a package deal!
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?|I’m sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff…
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.|Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?|Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Yeah.|You must be a little uncomfortable.
Oh good.|I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.|A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
I'm out of here|It was nice meeting you!
Well, we are ready to try anything.|Okay, there’s an herbal tea you can drink.
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?|Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.
So, you lied to him?|Achhh.� It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.� � Except with you.
Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.|That's a... pla-an.
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?|I’m so tired.  Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?|Yeah.  Don't do the dance.
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?|I don't know.
Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom.|
Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets|No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.|Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!
Who is it?|It's the police!
Hey!|Hey!
Is Amanda here yet?|No.
God!|So beautiful.
Hey, you!|Hey!
Hi!|So you gave in and decided to call someone?
I’m saying that… .|Man, tough week for Estelle!
Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!|We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!
Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I don’t think he’s ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!|She's right! If I were a guy and...  Did I just say if I were a guy..?
You don't know that.|Somebody is gonna pick us.
Well, it matters to me.|Why?
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.|Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?|I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.|What?
Hey, if you need a tour guide...|Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.|Why?
Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.|No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
Yes!|I love you!
I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day.|You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
Okay.  Let's get this bad boy on the road.|Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.|You'd do that for us?
Well, I'm very impressed.|Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!|Wow, what's the bad news!
Huh, and no cuddling.|And no kissing your neck.
Thank you, Pheebs!|Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
With Lennart Haze?|Yes.
Car accident.|Oh.
OK!|Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
We’re seriously asking for our money back?|It’s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?|I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I...|WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
Are you all right?|Uhh… I think I just got engaged.
Well you’re only two centimeters dilated and we need to get to ten. It’ll be a while.|Oh, okay.
Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.|Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumé.
Oh, DAMN IT!|Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.
What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!|It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?
man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.|: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what’s he like. People tell doctors everything.|But you said he was this great guy!
Well...  no.|Do you wanna get a drink?
Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.|Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?
I know.|I love this.
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?|Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
Oh, look at her, so happy!|If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
Did someone drop the baton again?|Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
Hi.|Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Really?|Uhuh.
Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!|Oh, I'm so sorry!
It was great.|Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.|Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few
Boss!|Mint!
Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?|Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!|Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
Yeah! Good night!|Goo--ood night!
Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?|No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
Why not?|Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game.� So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!|You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.|
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?|Uhh, uh...
Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.|Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?|Every little bit of you!
Thank you!  Oh, and I have something for you!|Mmh-mmh!
No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.|Ok, maybe you're right.
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
Thank you.|What is wrong with Emma?
What happened?|Well, remember how I was trying to achieve the positronic distillation of subatomic particles?
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?|Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
I think you should take the job.|Really?
No|oh it's just you have that look
Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...|Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.
I’ll give you really good odds.|Scott Silveri
No, you�re right. Mnya, we shouldn�t do it like this. Huch. For what it�s worth, I�m, I�m sorry. I shouldn�t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.|Mean it?
Thank you.|Oh wow, this feels weird.
Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?|Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.|Come on Chappy, do your business. MAKE! MA-AKE! I did not sign on for this.
Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I|Well it depends.
m'ap|mah
Okay, well the ??? is not home.|No. Uch.
Actually it's both of us.|What?
Hey hey! You dye your hair!|I'm a woman!
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?|Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...
How drunk are you?|Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
Okay let’s put aside that you  "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.|Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this  You were saying?
Hey!|Yeah.
Hi!|Hi.
Okay, not a fan of the tough love.|I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.|You sure?
That's a huge thing!|Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts  musings, if you will!
Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!|I don't think so!
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.|So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Oh|Hi
Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  I couldn't do it to Ross!|But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
She's mine!|She's m-i-i-ne!
Oh screw her, that part is mine!|Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.|Ooh! Tough odds!
Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.|How long was I in there?
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?|And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Oh...|What?
Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.|This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners.  Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
I'm Ross, Phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse.|Oh.
One thousand...|OK!
Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.|And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.|Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
I have nothing to say to you.|Wow, my flat is twice this size!
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.|Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.|Uch.
|Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
But we do!  It's gonna be ok, Rach!|Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
Oh. Who is the blonde, she's pretty.|OH! He's having an affair.
Okay is there…some kind of magic tunnel to this hospital?!|Ross, you stay here and talk, I’m gonna go have a baby.
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?|What? I get my own room?
Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this...  Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...|I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!|Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
Oh, that's great.|Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.|Uh, let's see, who do I hate?
You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really proposing?|No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.
Kiss him, you fool!!|What?
What’s going on?|We’re moving to Tulsa!
Oh right, right.� � So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?|Yeah, yeah.� Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.� And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
Monica!|Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.|Fine.
No, it's not!|It's not?  When was she born?
Ow!  Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!|It’s ok, it’s ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding
It's never gonna happen again right?|Right! Never! Never! I swear!
Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...|Seriously, we're gonna do this?
All right, let just try it again. Really listen.|Got it.
Y’know what?|What?!
Oh man!|There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!
I’m gonna leave the three of you alone.|Okay.
Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?|Uh-huh.
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!|Barbados.
Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.|Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
Oh wow, three hours and still no baby. Ugh, the miracle of birth sure is a snooze fest.|Hey, you wanna see something?
What...that scene I saw was so good!|Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
Crazy!|Ooor...
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.|Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
Yeah.|Hey!
Okay. And uh, are you married.|No.
Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say "neither".|Oh God, neither!
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!|Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
Good!|Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
Well, I might.|Really? Well, if you do, come in the spring. It's just lovely there.
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.|and who's fault is that.
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?|What?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|You put this in your coffee.
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!|Twenty-one hours, you’re a hero.
Y’know, I don’t really know her.|Why don’t we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow.
What the hell am I supposed to do!|All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.|Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.|Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?|Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
Yeah! This feels really good.|I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
Score.|Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties on
Oh my God!|Excellent!
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!|Oh, that's right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one|It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Yay.|Uh, Rach, hang on.
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.|Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!
Nothing! What do you say to that?|Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.|Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.
So how is this for our big double date tonight?|Oh my God!
David?|Phoebe! Hi!
see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?|you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
I know  but they’re just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.|I promise you she’s safe! No watch how much she loves this.
Well, I still think that it’s a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!|What were we talking about?
Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.|Ooh! Are you sure?
What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.|My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.|Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
Can I ask you a question?|Yeah.
Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...|
Oh god what am I gonna do you guys, I can’t even comfort my own baby! I’m the worst mother ever!|You’re just new at this, it’ll get better, think about your first day at work. I mean, that couldn’t have been easy but you figured that out.
I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.|I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Ready?
Ok|Have a seat through the glass doors.
This is okay. We’re all adults here; there’s nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let’s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.|Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?
Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.|Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.
You really should have been more clear about that!|Hey!
Come on, give me something. What's his name?|Mike.
It's to my apartment.|Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
Are you kidding me?!|It’s just so frustrating! Why doesn’t she want my breast?!
I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.|Well, I've brought some books. We could read.
Yeah...|That's right I am!
Really?|No you did.
Hi honey!|Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!
All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".|Je de coup Clow.
Heh.|Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.|I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.|From school.
Oh.|But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?|Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..|Well, then if there’s nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
Why are you wearing my apron?|I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.|Yeah, I guess that's true.
Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.|It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.
Well, I thought it first, Holmes.|Look, if you did...
Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.|Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.
Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?|But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Sure I do.  Coule?|No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|Come here  Oh! There she is! Hi!
Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.|Okay.
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.|B - O - S ...
Which one?|I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.|Well, how you died was funny.
First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.|I can do that!  "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?|Ok.
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?|Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
so how'd the date go?|well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
That's what I was doing too.|Well, you have fun tonight.
Hi!|Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
Hey, for what it’s worth, with Rachel I don’t think you’ll ever be just  "anybody."|Hey there you go!
Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?|Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.|Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.
Hey! What do you guys think about this. "Ross: The Divorce-Force".|Better.
Oh no! You and Phoebe are gonna help me in here.|
A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.|Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!
He's not having an affair!|You know, I'm always right about these things.
Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.|Not necessary.
Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.|She's out, I'm gonna take her home.
Yeah?|Give her some money.
Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?|Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
Oh! Why don't you introduce me?|Er, Rita, this is my husband.
Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.|Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.|No.
Hey you.|Hey and look he brought flowers. Thanks Ross, but I’m really more of a candy guy.
NO! I don't!!|Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!
Sure, May...tember.|October 18th.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?|Check again please!
Oh, me too...|Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
I cannot believe that after ten years, you do not know ONE thing about me.|Fine, then why didn't you say something?
Rach, Rach, knock knock.|Who's there?
Even if we want it really bad.|That's what we decided.
May I help you?|Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!|Which part exactly?
Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...|Joey.
Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?|It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.
Kiss me.|What?
I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.|Okay.
All right, me too.  Should we wake her up?|No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.
Everything doesn't sound fine!|Is he alright out there by himself?
I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!|Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Yeah I don’t think dressing provocatively is going to help me here! Oh my god just please take her.|Okay I’ll take her, here.
Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.|Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.
Ok...|This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?� I mean, they said thirty minutes or less.� Well, how long has it been?|� And now twelve.� So, do you like the beer?
But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.|I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?
We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.|Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
How can you be so confident?|Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
I don't have to tell you everything!|Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
|I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.|Picturing that tree?
No. Here|HEY!
Rach, you sure you wanna do this?|Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...|And sexy.
No, no. No.|But... ergo...
I love when you talk dirty to me.|Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh!  Oh God!
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.|What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Fine!|Thank you.
Hi|listen to this... I went out with this girl last night and half way through our date I realized I already slept with her.
Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.|Well, hey! Well...  To Phoebe and Mike!
Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?|Sure, he was in your "band"?
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.
Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What�s wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation they|Uh, clearly.
Yeah.|Good-bye.
What does she do there?|Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
It’s pretty, Okay date of birth?|You know my birthday.
Awesome.|Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?|
Oh yeah .|Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?
� Oh yeah.� I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.|There's nobody here Joe.
You're crazy.|Crazy, or... romantic?
Well, I... I am having a good hair day.|So good to see you.
Wow. She does that a lot!|Ross, you didn�t tell me you were a doctor!
Okay.|I'm serious!
|You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
How far outside?|Manhattan.
Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me?|
Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh."|Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.|Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get…|Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it!  You can relax now. Yeah.
No.  That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?|Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!|Ooh! We have a problem.
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.|Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
Hi|Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!
Will the stable boy never get the princess??|What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!|So how's the piano playing going?
Ok|Hi, is Molly here?
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?|What do you think Pheebs?
Hello?|Joey, it’s Estelle.
No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.|Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
Mom, y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…|Just…think about it. If you don’t, I’ll talk more about humping.
You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!|Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
Well, come on...|Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.|A love scene? With who?
I know!|And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?
They loved it.|What?
Can somebody please go in?|Absolutely.
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.|Alright! Just follow my lead!
That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.|Clifford Burnett.
Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.|What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
So?� What if they do?|Well, we're not here to meet guys.� You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.
I know.� �� So, what's going on with you and Ross?|Well, um . . . I don't know.� I mean, for a long time nothing.� But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.
Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...|But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don't you go talk to my mom?
Yes, it was.|No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old…
What are you doing?|Setting rat traps.
Oh my god you're right.|I know and yet here you are all ready for the next date.
Madame, you must have your boarding pass..|Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Well, I don't...|Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
The Metsss!|Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Hi Frank.|Hi, how you doin'?
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!|Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.
Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.|I don't care about any of that!!
Wow, really?|Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
You gonna tell her?|Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.|E-e-excuse me?
Okay, well, bye!|Bye!
What?|Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Make the transfer!|Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus.|No, Mike, no, no. You wanna pick me, I mean... watch!  Huh?
Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.|I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
You did?|Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I�m not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she�s doing at home and I�m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
I don’t believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?|Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.|Make love? What are you a girl?
You did? How?|Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Hey!  I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.|Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.
Just ignore them.|Ross.
We gotta get them out of there!|How?
Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!|It was Jones.
I know what this is all about... You've always been|Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly
Well it stupid, unfair question!|Don’t blame the questions!
You won awards?|Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
That's insane!|Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?|Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.|By drowning or...?!
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?|I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?
No|you look great.
Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.|Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
Thank you. Can you believe no-one between my apartment and here offered to do that for me?|people  so why you all dressed up.
You can't move. You just... you just can't.|Rachel's right. This is where you guys belong.
You took the same class twice.|It was hard!
Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.|I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?|No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Okay, shoot!|Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
Oh God!|No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry.  Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?|Tsz... NO! .
Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell… or smoke.|Oh my god.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?
I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!|Better think of a new name for him.
Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!|You’re right, you’re right! I’m gonna do it!
Oh my God!|Relax! We just get her some antacids.
I don't know...|One more fight!
Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.|Ah, yes, The Plan!
No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!|Hey! High-five!
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please?  I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.|Phoebe, where's your purse?
Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...|Is this your first appology?
Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.|Still… this is amazing… Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
ROSS!|Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller
I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that!|Okay
Well, yeah.|Okay.� Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by|oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
OOH! God! Sorry!|I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!|Not knowing when to shut up...
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.|I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.|And you really think this is a good idea?
I can't... I can't hear it again.|You know, I can't tell it again...
Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!|Try to understand!
Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.|Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
M-Me-me-me!|You both wanna do it? Uhm... there's only room for one.
Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.|Yeah.
Name one of his books.|"The Firm"?
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds about right.|Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
You're so efficient. I love you!|Let's go!
Well, Phoebe's still pretty hung up on that Mike, uh?|I wouldn't read too much into it.
Really? Okay, so...|Know when to stop.
Oh! Emma might like what?|Um, my present!
I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.|Then you're not gonna like what's coming.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
I don't know, but it sounds great.|Your agent called. You got that audition.
What are you doing here?|Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!|I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
We got some time.|Okay, should we get some coffee?
And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said?|Don’t you love the huge yard?
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.|Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go to your room! You're grounded"?
This room’s available.|Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that’s four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I’m next! It’s my turn! It’s only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I’m going to sue you! Not this hospital, I’m going to sue you! And my husband  he’s a lawyer!
Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?|Now, that you can do.
So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?|Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?|Sorry, looks like it's just him.
Yeah!|Without that, you just got "lame with women".
Yeah?|Can you come here with me for a minute?
Hey, Phoebs|Hey.
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.|Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn’t want to either. But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?
Okay, what’s up?|I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
Yeah.|So you took off my pants and shoes?
Okay so listen I’m gonna go lay down.|What?
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.|You kissed her that night too?
But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?|No.
I know..|I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
What a small world!|And yet I never run into Beyonce!
You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so…|Hey!
From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?|Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.|Thank you.  All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.|Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Chandler, you stink of cigarettes.|Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?
Yess!!|We're teeth people Zack!
Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin|I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.|Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.|Why?
You too.|Oh, I will.
No way!|You can't just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?
Oh my God, that's Charlie!|She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
"You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!"|Absolutely amazing!  The part is yours.
Stop it.|Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?|I proposed to Chandler!  Alright, moving on...
You know what. I think this audition is over.|Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.|.
No, and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle and... well, I would just really love it if you would do it.|Seriously?
All right.|You can go.
But Chandler lent you money!|And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.
Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.|I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.
No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.|Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|I have a ring.
Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!|We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
What?|Still, he had to find out sometime.
Both of them?|No, one of them...
Oh, thank God.|Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.
The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?|Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.
Wow!|Rach, come on, I’m not gonna wear any of this! .
In Minsk...|Yeah?
Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.|You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
I don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancy’s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day.|Gotcha. When do we tell them about this?
So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.|Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
Oh, no! Who did that?|Chandler... hey...
Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.|Well, not at all...
Mhmm.|You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?
The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.|Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
I've got good news!|You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
Yeah!|Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
Yeah?|About that? Erm...I'm going to change.
Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.|That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
Yeah.|A-a-and... record.
There's no seatbelt!|That's okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, so you know, it's better if you're thrown from the car.
No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.|You miss your girlfriend?
Yay!|But you already gave all your money to charity!
I'm so sorry...|Is-is he ok?
Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!|You too.
Did you uhm...|No, no...
Hi Amanda! Actually now... it’s... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night?  Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!|Why, why, why didn’t you just say no!
God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?|I thought I was something that we both wanted!
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!|Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.|Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
Hey.|Hey.
No-no-no, wait! We need something old!|Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.|What, is he your pet rat?
Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.|I lost it. To drugs.
Huh?|I never stopped loving you.
Who is it?|Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
Uh-huh!|Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?
No, I-I-I love it there.|Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
Hey Joey!|Hey!
God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.|There's a hair in my coffee.
Wait! Oh wait!|Ready?
So, you know I'm filling in for Phoebe's step dad, tomorrow, right?|Yeah, yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.|Those are my shoes.
That tape was never meant to be seen by...  Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.|
And then, and then you said that thing about, about bringing the Mesozoic era in the 21st century.|Yeah, that's it?
No problem! Next week: stealing...|Bye plates!
Oh man.|Promise to call me when you land.
Oh, damn it!|I sleep with him!
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?|Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
You didn’t do anything wrong?!|I said I didn’t technically.
Yes I can!|No you can't. She's yours!
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.|Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
: maybe I will go  yea will have a second honeymoon at the Tulsa romana.|oh and you know what you should bring the black see-through teddy with the attached garters.
Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer|Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?|Cool!
No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.|Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
You are never going to believe what happened to me today.|What?
Chandler, what are you talking about?|Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
Interesting.|I guess!
I am sooo drunk.|That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.|Yeah look, about tomorrow, I... I've got a question for ya. I just found out that one of my groomsmen had had an emergency and can't make it.
I know.|Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.|Phoebe, we lost half of them.
Ehm, we were friends in 1992.|calls and trying to avoid seeing her.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!|Hi there.
Okay what’s up|Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.|Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in|It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?
Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.|What do you mean?
yeah I've nothing to be ashamed of ok so I haven't been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month. Ok I haven't had a real boyfriend you know if he can't handle that he can leave. which he will and that's ok. so I'll just be alone forever you know alright I'll be. it'll be fine. it'll be fine. I'll go walking tours with widows and lesbians. Oh|I'll get it
Oh, major shampoo explosion!|Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
Which technically now you should give back!|You told him he's adopted?
I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.|Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
... Phoebe...?|... and...?
That's because he's on your neck.|Well...  Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
Your thoughts? Plural?|Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!
Yeah... Yeah, that's true.|Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
What?|ALL FOOD!
Wha . . .?� Go back?� To the "land where time stands still"?|I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.� So, you have to intercept all his calls.
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!|I'll show you how.
Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.|No you didn't.
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?|If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.|So, why are you still wearing it?
Thank you!|Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
Joey, do you speak French?|Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring!|OH!
Sure.|Are you wearing waterproof mascara?
All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.|Hey!
Oh yeah.|Phoebe come here
Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.|Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
We don’t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing.|Okay. Right. Oh my God that is gonna be so hard.
That’s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.|Don’t take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
Thank you!|Would you like something to drink?
She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal.  And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.|GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!
No! It�s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it�s a little to soon to show my true colors.|Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma.  Which one of us should go to dinner?
Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?|Why does everyone keep saying that?
Yeah, he came up...|Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.
Fine.|
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Yep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?
Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?|
I know but he call's and my heart goes to him. You know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer.|I just think there's somebody better out there for you,  I mean I'm not saying me but. maybe me.
I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?|Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.|Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?|I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you  but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.|Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
It�s been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table.|Maybe we should just eat now.
Wow, this is a lot!|Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine.
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.|Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.|OK, Pheebs, your turn.
How could he leave me?!?!|I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!|Fine.
Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.|No, too late. You can't give it back!
But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.|Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.|I think I know who you’re talking about.
Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...|Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui...
Okay.|No... It's all glued together.
Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go  ohhhh!|So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
Oohh, I love it!|Really? You're not gonna return it?
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!|Well, at the Christmas party him and Santa did some definitely gay stuff!
I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching?|Hey dude, what's up?
Thank you.|And what is his name?
�s a good toast.|Could you please get her attention?
You really did that?|Yep.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.|This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Estrangement .|But it happens?  I�m gotta go to the bathroom.
Your thumb? That’s weird.  Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.|You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.|It wasn’t fun?!
Yeah, Monica made us!|Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if it wasn’t for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know it’s gonna take patience, but that’s ok.
Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...|You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
Celebrity.|Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it|Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the keys?|Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!
Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.|Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
Yeah?|� Never mind.
Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>|Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
See ya!|Did that guy really make that joke?
Oh my god, we killed Bob!|Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse.
That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.|I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
Eh, just a tad.|You’re about 80 percent effaced, so you’re on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you’re anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.|Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Well hey, I wanna ask you about Monica's little "groomy" joke.|Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|It's like a giant hug.
this is my wife, Nancy.|Get Out!
Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..|What are you gonna name the baby?
A little more.|Okay.
Morning. Here you go.|Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.|Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
What else did you think about?|Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?|All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...
Okidoki!  Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.|Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews  And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.
Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .|Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.|Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
What did you get her?|Actually we prepared performances.
I saw you.|Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
Hello?|Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole "I never want to get married" thing and step up!
Hey, they were popular when I left!|Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
What?|Your last dance. Do it for us.
OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn|: really?
Two hundred.|Thank you!
Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?|This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.|This has been torn up.
Really? You think?|Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.|Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
Some girl...!?|She hot?
Okay, that helps.|And...Action!
Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.|That's really nice.
I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!|Who's Amanda?
Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is "if you can't come on time, then don't come at all".  Shall we?|You don't think we should wait for him?
So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing.� Fascinating isn't it.|Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!|Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
Okay.|You know what I really really want?
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!|How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!
I can't think of anything.|Thanks!
Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.|Why? Why today?
Oh my God! David!|Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?
Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot!  By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.|I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Well, this is very generous!|Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.
You got it!  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!|No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.|Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.|Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.|The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
Oh, because, um . . .� well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple of days.� So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.|Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
Nice, put it with the others.|And I also got... two more apples.
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?|Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Ah! You know what honey guys are just different, they like things that we can't understand, you know I once dated this guy who wanted to pretend he was an archeologist and I was a naughty cave woman that he unfroze from a block of ice.|: Eww are you talking about my bother.
I did!|
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.|Exactly!!
Hey! What do you have there?|Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but..
So who are you?|Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
Man... I... I'm sorry.|Look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
|Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.|Ok, you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?|But you are a real boy!
A teacher?|Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
So.|Yeah.
What else? What else?|Uh, well he’s 33.
Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!|Ross' shirt is torn.
Haha!|You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Ok.|Ready sweety?
Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.|Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.|Alright, I can�t, I can�t wait that long. You have to do something�knock that door down!
That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.|But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
Previously on Friends.|Erica, are you okay?
No problem.|Listen that�s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.|: Oh well this is the only one they had at our video store, but they did have something called crocodile killers. Or does it always have to be sharks?
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Oh my God!
Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?|I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Olè!|What are you doing here!
From... Cosmo??|Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?|Three.
Wow.|What?
No! We're gonna do it my way.  Hello?|I'm glad we had this little talk.
Okay, here we go. I can't do it.|Well, I can't do it either.
Why are you here?|Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...
Oh... okay.|Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
Hi.|Oh God.�
Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.|And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
Okay, my turn. My turn.  I won’t.|What’s the matter?
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.|What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Hey you guys.�|Hey.
Hey!|Hey!
Yeah, but you can't do that.|Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
I�m serious. C�mon, you should go. Here.  No, uh-uh, just go.|What � Oh!
She’s gonna be fine. Okay, she’s in a more difficult position so you’re gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!|Go!
What?|She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!|Let’s see.. to assure you get this directly, ring me back on my mobile.
Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?|Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
That’s great. I worry about little Ross. He’s always reading, he's collecting rocks and he’s obsessed with dinosaurs.|He’ll be fine.
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?|Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.|Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
Hey.|Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?|Are you kidding, I love it!
That's stealing!|No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that?|No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Kate Miller it is.|And... that's the most sex I'm gonna have this weekend.
Oh, give me!|Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.|Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
Do it!|Monica!
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?|Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.|She's got her cell, you could call her.
WHAT!|umm. that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named Vicrum.
well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?|Well, what is going on with you two?
Oh.|Rachel?
This place is awesome!|You know, we should just go, I’m not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
Ow!|Who are you?
Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?|Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.
All right.� I'll do it.� � But really, how much dirtier can it get?|Oh, Mike.� Bye.
IF you hold a spider.|I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?|How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
So... now... What about with Mike's mom?|Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.
I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.|Oh yeah!
I know, I still need to talk to you.|Oh hey but, before you guys do that  I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
Not gonna find any clothes in there!|Hey, you guys!
Hi|Hey! Hi!
Right!|Yeah, that was an awesome day!
No!|I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!|Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?|The thing we never do.
Hell, yeah!|Did you know this about him?
Excuse me?|Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is "spermtastic"!
Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!|Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!|Huh!
Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.|Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.|It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
What?|So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
Ah, you mean lager.|Ah yeah.� Good times.
Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?|I don't know. Except that, for one last time...  Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.
What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!|No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
To use the bathroom.|You can't leave me alone with her.
Yah.|You are incredible. Unless, I�I�m not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.
There’s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn’t even be put up for it! She’d better have a good reason.|I’m guessing she does.
I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.|I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...
Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?|No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!|Ooh...I hear that's bad.
Oh, this could take a while.|Get out of my line.
Hey, how was class?|No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?
Oh, look at these little bunnies!|I know! You ready to trade?
It's just a cold|Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!|Honey, it's gonna be okay.
Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.|Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.
I'm sorry. Are you ok with that? Cause if not...maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.|No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you’re trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.|You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
Uh, no.� I just left.|Well, you have to go back in.
Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...|Damnit. OH!  Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.|Little people?
What? Hey, hey, listen..|Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.|I can't believe I won.
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!
Hey guys!|Hi!
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.|I could fall asleep at a play.
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity?  Damnit!
So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?|We’re trying to get pregnant.  Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
Yeah, it takes two incomes.|Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Hold on! There is something different.|I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.
Rachel, this is yours.|Aah! Why? What are these for?
You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.|Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.|Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn’t propose.
Come on you stupid machine! Come on!|Oh, it ate your money?
Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.|He's not stoned.
Hey, Rach!|This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Hey! How was basketball?|Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I can�t remember why.  You�re not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?|Yes, in Oklahoma it�s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less.  Would you like one?
Can�t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.|Oh my god, I left the water running.
Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend .|Sit down.
So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.|Who?
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!|What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
He... he's gonna propose?|I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
You know, ah, I’ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it’s not my fault. It’s a natural instinct.|Hey, what you guys talking about?
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!|But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Hey!|You were incredible!
There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.|I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.|Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!|That’s not even a word!
Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness...|They're never coming down now.
Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.|Oh... what does that mean?
Thank God you’re here. Listen to this!|what?
I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...|You're the best friend I ever had.
Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.|Look, doctor!
I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.|Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!|Do you?
Hey, I need your help.|Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
Joey, wait!|
And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.|He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
Thats not how you see me, is it?|No you're all about the fun.
Do you think they recognize each other from in there?|Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
Oh good, I hate it when you do that|And lots of kissing your neck.
Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?|My name is Precious.
She is good!|Huh, I took a shot there.
You guys, what was the Powerball number again?|Seven.
But you were going to propose?|No!!
Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.|Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.
It does, really?|Yeah.
Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.|I'm kind of funny looking.
Who is this?|This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!|Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
Chandler gets pedicures!|Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!|Well, I can't give you a massage, because my licence has been revoked again!
D�you want to?|Yeah, let�s celebrate life!
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.|Wow, this is weird.
Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.|Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
Aah... I bet you're right.|So...
Chandler, you don't have a sister so you can't understand how much this bums me out.|I didn't know Monica had these!
Well, do you care about friendship?|Oh!
Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.|Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.|The doctor will be right with you sir.
Oh, that's not cool.|Dude, none of this is cool.
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!|You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the|Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before
Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.|And we're out!
I mean this is so great! We’re gonna be baby buddies!|Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby’s ears!
I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say…|There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Alright-y then.|Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
Yes.|I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!
Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!|Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
But now she'll never know how he feels!|Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents..  Right?
Yeah, where were you!|Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?|
Okay, that was Mike.|Phoebe, hi, we�re so sorry. You�re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.|I beg to differ .
Good job.|Thank you.
You mean like this?|NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this.
Sorry. . You ok?|Yeah.
That’s fine, for now we’ll just call her Baby Girl Green.|Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?|Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.
Mine.|I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
Where is everyone? They�re forty minutes late.|I know, u-uch.
What did it say?|Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Hey Joe!|What's up?
Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?|oh yes, God yes!!
Ewww, is that what that is?|Sorry!
Can I just say, I really admire what you’re doing. Just raising her all alone.|Oh, I’m not doing it alone. I have Ross.
You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about|Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
I'm not sure about this.|Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
Then what did happen?|Yeah, what did happen?
You know, he was just doing his job...|Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
What, Rach?|I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.
Okay. Let’s hurry—Oh wait! Do we have a condom?|Yes, 98.6. You’re gonna be fine.
Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of...  Hey!|I'm in college and I'm in a band.
Oh hi!|Who’s this little guy?
Hey|Welcome back!
Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head...  Can it?|Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...
No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!|But can it... just... happen a little bit?
What?|Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
I'm dead and no one cares?|I look like a man??
Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.|Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.|Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !|oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
You really think so?|I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.  "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.|Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.|What are you doing?
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.|I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
I don't know!|Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.|You should go.
Right! .. but we "know" what you're wishing for!|Can't really say!
Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.|Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!
Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.|Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?
I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.|Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Och, god.  Oh, thank god, you�re okay. I�m so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.|Great. So let�s get going?
She has the drugs!|We’ll do a quick check.
That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!|What?
|Heeeeeey!
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!|My coat...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!|Hey!
Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?|They are awfully boxy...
All right, everybody open them!|Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
Archery?|No.
Okay, can you really tapdance?|No.
Ok. Why?|Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
Are you trying to get everybody divorced?|You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the
I don't get a goodbye?|What?
Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.|No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
Hey, hey!|Hey, you'll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!
Olivia.|Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.
No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!|Who dies?
I know, I hate being left out of things.|And it's a wedding! It'd be weird if I'm not in it...
Miss?|I - I have to get on the plane.
Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?|Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
Oh, no problem.|And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.|Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
Well, I hope, you got some room left.|Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear �
Okay...|Hi... I'm Sandy.
Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.|It's gonna be ok.
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.|Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
Honey.|Yea yea.
Well, I guess they�re not coming. You wanna just order?|Thank you.
Canoodling?|Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?|What?
Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy...|Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.|What?
Hi|Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
There are no tickets on the nightstand!|Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
I'll get it.� � It's for you.|I don't understand what just happened here.
A-And??|A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.
Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn’t love. Do you remember Barry?|Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.
Right, right, yes!|Don't panic!
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.|Oh my god.
Oh, yeah.|She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
She did? Why?|I made her.  Steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding". Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
This is like figure skating team all over again.  Help me!|FOOTBALL!
Yeah, yeah, and directing.|He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.
We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.|Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!|Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…|Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  "gay as the day is long"?|Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like|Actually about an hour and a half.
Hey, what are you working on?|It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
Yes.|Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?
What?|It's what you want. You should go.
Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .|It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
What?|This doesn't feel weird!
They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!|Oh yeah, she can't be herself.
Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.|Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!|Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
Yeah well, that's the thing. For me it's as far as it can ever go.|What do you mean?
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!|Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Why?|Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.|Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
Yeah.|You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
Are you serious?|When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Strike two!|You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
Excuse me?|What's with the kissing?
Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.|And you're not helping?
|Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.|Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
so basically you've slept with all the woman in New York and now you're just going around again.|well that's not even the weird part. I don't think she remembered sleeping with me.
NO!|ADRIENNE TURNER!!
No|I'll go in there.
Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.|Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!|What?
Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.|Well, you got uhm... good energy.
You got sprayed with two two' s and...|I'm a four?
Ok, hey Rach?|Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...|Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
We are pretty good.|But nothing has to happen until your ready.
What are you doing?|You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
so you don't think I'm a total freak|No. well look can I think your weird and also cool for telling me the truth and also wanna kiss you.
Oh, hey, my pleasure.  So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?|I intend to marry her.
Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?|Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
Hell yeah!|So shake it!
What are you guys doing?|Try it, I can't feel a thing!
Right. So, it'll be the same except… less sex with you.|So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?
Are you friends with him?|I can explain... Joey...
Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...|Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...|Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
The wife says "Hi!".|Ah. Fun conversation?
Is she in there?|Yeah. She’s putting her down now, that’s her.
You are the official baby crier stopper!|Yes I am!!
I want Gladys!|She's mine!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.
Hey.|Heeeeey, where have you been?  What happened to you?
I see, and Dr. Biely?|Three for excavation and two for analysis.
No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?|No, I'm okay.
Well, I don't care, so you pick!|Did you just hung up on me?  All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.|It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
Of course it does! It’s smart! I used the the-saurus!|On every word?
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.|That's great.
Fine, it's fine...  I'll just shower by myself...|B, B, B, B, B!
Hey buddy.|Uh, hi.
Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.|Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.
Why, you don't like her?|Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!
Hey!|Hey!
Whoo-hoo!|You're kicking me out?
Mmh-mmh.|Can you say Barbados?
Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.|Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!|They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
Oh, no. He doesn't have time for that. But if you want, you can go help him and Joey pack up the guest room.|Mhm,  packing - sexy cheerleader comedy.
Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.|I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.|but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?|Ooh... Not so good.
Oh yeah, sure. No problem.|What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
Well, I was thinking...|Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.|What is it...?
Get your garlic-peelers off me!|
Oh well that’s what I thought about my first husband, now I’m lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.|Really?
So, ehm... I'm proposing to Pheobe tonight.|Tonight?!  Oh, there it is!
I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.|Sure  Just not as much as clams.
I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!|Ok!
You wouldn’t let her have a grape?|Oh no! Not me! Emma!
How much were you thinking?|Ten bucks a game?
That's terrible!|Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!|Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
But you two were supposed to be together.|Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|Okay Buckwheat!
Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.|It's great! How?
I've been pretty good!|You look really beautiful.
Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!|Yes I did, I’m Monica, Super Aunt
What?|It's not bad.
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|But I'm bursting with u-hu!
Wow, you're here already.|Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
Geez!|Ok. Quick. We gotta find a cab and follow them.
Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.|Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it…
Amy, hi!|I took your advice, I left Myron.
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.|Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
Hey.|Hey.
Why?|I don�t know.
When were we not friends?|Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel .
Well then we’d be in a lot of trouble, you don’t know where any countries are.  opened up?|This is a hospital.
Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.|Rachel Green?  Son of a bitch, she came back?
Yes, please!|Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
I can't believe this.|But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.|Rossy, we're ready for you.
Come on, Ross, that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.|Yeah that’s what she said.
Night.|Ok, good night!
Me! I'm up for puppets!|Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?
I punched you...?|And...?
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!|My dad told me. They play golf together.
How many kids were we gonna have?|Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
That was me.|No, she was this really dorky girl in high school that used to follow Rachel around like a puppy dog.
And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but why couldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.|I know I should’ve.  "I’m sorry."
Hey!|Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Dude! You're not taking your Bible?|You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
Yeah!|Come on Ben.
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!|Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?|I read a lot.
That's so sweet. Find anything?|Slim Pickings.
Really?|Yeah, you'd think I'd give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway? Huhuh...
God! God! This is not going well.|No, no, no, you're doing fine, really... Why don't you go talk to my dad?
Are they still looking for us?|Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores.  You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
Oh, I like my job.|I *love* my job.
Hi there!|Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?
I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two  are on your own.|Well… That’s…y’know—That’s—We’ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we’re doing okay. Besides y’know what? I-I—Maybe we won’t be alone, ‘cause lately I-I—things have been happening between me and Ross, y’know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y’know? So it might be the…the beginning of something.
Okay I’ve got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?|I’d have to say…the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you’re making me eat him.
Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.|Yes dear.
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.|What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
What?|No, I can't.
What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken?  See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?|No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?
Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys… except for the tie, the briefcase… and the fact that I can rent a car.|Seriously, you're an intern?
Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.|Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!
Oh, she's still napping|Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?|All right, watch me!  Okay, you time me. Ready?
Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.|Why?
Yeah, wow.|I was wondering you both have such serious jobs.  Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
Horseback riding?|Would fall off a lot.
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.|I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
Oh... then I overpaid.|Hey, what's this?
I know nothing! Mike’s a great guy, it was hypothetical!|All right. . He is a good guy. You’re right, he wouldn’t cheat.
Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!|You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
Come on, finish your enchilada.|Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.
Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.|Oh...
Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!|Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?
Ross...|I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
Can you believe they're still not here?|I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...|I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.|You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Ok.
Whoa, how do you know about that?|Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,
I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...|Oh, that's really ok.
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?|I'd love to! Yeah!
No, he's in prison.|Was he falsely accused of something?
|Oh, my!
Hey, how was the Met?|The museum was amazing!
No!|Come on!
Good morning Phoebe.|Good morning receptionist.
It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.|Are you serious?
I know, it�s the first time, we�re leaving the baby and � hey, I know how hard it is for you, but � but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She�s great with kids.|She is?
Which one is which again?|Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick|Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
You're married more than once?|No.
Good, you don’t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?|Irrational, huh? All right, well, I’ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Leave it.|I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn�t have sex with me while we�re fighting.
I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?|
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.|I said it first, bro.
Nothing, I really wanna know.|Oh…  Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene…
Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.|Absolutely.
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.|Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?|I know.
These aren't suede.|Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?
well there is no Vicrum, Ross made him up because I never really have been in a long-term relationship, I've never lived with a guy, and I've never even celebrated an anniversary so.  You kissed me.|uh huh
Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...|I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that's my bra-size.
It's in the cake, isn't it?|
All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.|Alright, what are we gonna say?
Oh, she’s so beautiful.|Here.
Why don't you take Ross?|Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
Yeah?�|I don't know what to say.� We shouldn't have lied to you.
It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.|Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
Hey, is Rachel here?|No.
What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.|Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.|Ross, wait!
Was that place... The Sun?|Oh! And it gets worse!
Well, not this second!|Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.|That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.|Then I'm happy too.
Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.|Ok!  Ow!
Wow!|Really? Do you not know Chandler?
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!|Ok!
Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?|Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.
Great, ok faster! "je"|je.
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.|Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Hey you guys!
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.|Sounds like he's with someone.
Hello?|Hey, Mike, it's me.� Listen, is um, is Ross near you?
To kill Bob??|No, no, to test his neck strength.
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?|Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.|No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
What? I-I don't.|You don't?
What's wrong?|I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?|Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...|I am learning so much from you.
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
But he's the same.|Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
Oh for the love of God!|It’s coming! It’s coming!
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!|Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
What was that?|Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with
Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!|Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
So uh... I guess I wanna take off.|Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
Ok.|Do you smell beets?
Thank you. I got a job in advertising.|Oh, honey, that's incredible!
Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?|Diapers huh?
God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.|Does he?
Who are you kidding?  You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!|Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!! Mike!!
Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?|Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
Hey hey, can I help?|Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.
Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to.|
Honey, that's gorgeous!|You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
If you want I could loan you some money?|Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.
That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?|Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.
Who is it?|Gavin! I brought you some soup.
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|I'm not interested.
No it's not!|Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
Hey, what's-what's going on?!|Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
