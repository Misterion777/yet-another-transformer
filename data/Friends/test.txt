So are you gonna...talk to her?|Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|Hi Phoebe.
No, I don't think so.|You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk. It was pretty intense.
You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!|No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You know
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!|Yes, you do.Yes...you do. I'm the one who doesn't have a choice because I...because I can't stop loving you.
Thanks!|Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
Oh my God, this is so cool!|Ok, odd thing to get excited about!
Look at you with all the guys!|Yeah!
Oooohh that’s interesting.|But if we win, we get your apartment.
Whoo-hoo!|Excuse me?
I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob?  Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!|Better think of a new name for him.
Jack, look at this.|Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
Do we have a name yet?|No, not yet.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|Janice I didn’t even know you were pregnant! Who’s the unwitting human who’s essence you’ve stolen?
Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...  Ow!|You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
Eh, you work for that.|Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?|Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.|Robert Carlock
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.|Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!|
Hey, hey!|Seriously?
Oh, why? What's up?|I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.|Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Are you gonna change yours?
God!|So beautiful.
Hey.|Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.|Nice.
Yeah, where were you!|You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.|Hey, what's wrong?
Nighty-night!|Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
Well, do you think I should propose?|I think it could be kind of great!
Hi!|Hey! You smell like perfume and cigarettes.
So bad.|So bad.
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...|That's... my boy.
What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?|Not since my cop-show got cancelled.
Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?|Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
Hey! Ready to go?|Hey Ross, check this out!  yeah, I can't do that!
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.|Oh yeah? Well, let's see.
Yeah. Well, uhm... listen he was supposed to get a weekend furlough, so he'd come to the wedding tomorrow, but he just called and... uhm... well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday.|So he can't come?
Mike? Okay! What's his last name?|Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!|So, where's Mike?
Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!|Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .
I am those things, yeah.|You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
Yeah.|So hi!
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|Okay...
So you forfeit?|What?
Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!|Do you?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Yeah, Rachel. And this .
Yeah, Ross is here so...|I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
Really?|That is the exact same thing.
�kay, see you there. Happy humping!  Hey�hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, don�t people know, you�re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?|Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.
Poor baby, you’re so tired. Rach, I didn’t propose to you, Joey didn’t propose to you, and Chandler didn’t propose to you.|Uh… You didn’t propose to me, Chandler didn’t propose to me, but Joey did.
Why?|That's not very enlightened!
But now she'll never know how he feels!|Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents..  Right?
I am not doing this over the phone.|Hello?
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Aren't we done with that?
AH YEAAAAH!|C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
So, you're ready to do this?|Uhuh, uhuh... Oh my God! This is really happening.
No, I arranged that...|We know about your party Joey.
Are you serious?|If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!
Whoa, how do you know about that?|Because he called here looking for you. So don�t tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,
Where did you go to do it?|Here you go.
I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!|Maybe you do that next time you get married!
Well, the club lost it's power.|I can't believe you guys aren't going to be able to get married today.
Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?|I don't know, but one of the extras sure did!  Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
I just can’t see Chandler cheating!|I’m telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in Westchester, the went in for like forty-five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy!
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight"
All right, all right.|I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea.
...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?|Uhm... A penis model.  Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|This can not be happening!
Who's Nancy?|I knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes!!
Dessert?|Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize .
Dead.  Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.|Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.
I'll let you get acquainted.|Let her finish, doctor.
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!|Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Hey.
But you obviously haven't.|How can I help you?
Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.|Yeah, I guess that's true.
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|
I'll let you get acquainted.|Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.
Ooh, I want one...|Me too...
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.|I don't know. Maybe church-camp?
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.|Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.|I'm not your brother.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.|What? That's terrible!
Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!|Ok, I...
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|Drake! What are you doing in here?
You're not making the pies yourself?|Did you at least win the contest?
Other wall, people! Other wall!|How are you doing this?
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Joey just called.� He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
All right.|Yeah, I'll be fine.� You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|Every year.
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?|Yep, we got it, we got it.  Thank you so much.
Well, I... I am having a good hair day.|So good to see you.
Why don’t we talk about this on the way to the hospital?|Good, good yeah,  "Oops."
Previously on Friends...|Thank you! Thank you!
Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.|Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.
Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?|Oh man! I thought I got it all!
Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!|Ross' shirt is torn.
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|Hey!
Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?|Okay. Uh, we’ll dim the lights, dim the lights.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|You doing ok?
I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.|You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.|You know what? You can have mine.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Mon, I'm so sorry.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?
And so incorrect!|Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
Hi.|Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.
Ok, we're still on that.|Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
You guys, we�ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.|Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast � to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.
Hey, hey!|Oh my god…
Right. So, I'm sorry...|Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was ... happy?
Ok.|I’m gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.
Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!|Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...
It's.. It's just so pretty and white.|I would have told him to do it too.
I lent them to Ross.|Oh!
Where did you go to do it?|I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.|
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.|Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000 .
This thing welded shut?!|Okay.
Hey!|Chandler, where are your tools?
Yeah!|It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
Yeah?|Well, after eight years of research I discovered that it can't be done.
Bye.|Uh-huh.  Y’know what I was, I was thinking about?
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey!
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...|Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway?
I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.|So maybe something in an office.
|Hey
What is the big deal?|It's weird! In a doctor's office?
Wher-where have you been?|Rach, c�mon, Emma is fine. You�re turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.
Oh man.|Bye honey.
So, what's new?|Well, I'm no longer Phoebe Buffay.
Bye, see ya.|What?
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?|Excuse me.
Yeah, yeah, and directing.|No, but… I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|So you know this leaves us with...
Dr. Long, I’ve been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?|Just three?! I’m dilated three!
14?|Maurice.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... "Dear..."
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|You put this on a hamburger!
I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.|But you left.
Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.|I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.
On...?|On how far along he's in the sex change process!
Yeah, I guess!|OH MY GOD!!
Hi.|Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?
Wow!|Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! . I mean, this is just beautiful!
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|It's white!
What's up?|... finally...
I don't know!|Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?|Ok.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|Nothing.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Oh, but of course it is!
Hi!|Hey.
Incentive For Men?|On Melanie Griffith in "Working girl". I think what you want is over here.
Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin|I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|Yeah! But that is not what they're looking for.  OOOH!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Seriously? Its.. its just these rooms? <moves hands around motioning 'just these rooms'> <To Ross> I thought you were a doctor.
oh I dunno I dunno, you know I mean I like him but am I ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market.|you know I really admire your whole dating attitude, it's so healthy I'm always like is this moving to fast? Is this moving to slow? Where's this going?
We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.|If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!
Previously on Friends...|I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!|Fine, I'll give you her number.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Cindy Crawford, Christie Brinkley, Heidi Klum, Claudia Schiffer...
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|It's open!  Hi, Joe!
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."|We have to get out of here, baby!
What?|So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|Kinda stepped on the toes of what I was going to say.
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|That's off, right?
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.|Then it's okaaay!
Yeah!|It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
Hey, what are you working on?|It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.|Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?
She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message.  "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"|Are you trying to do a British accent?
Sure.|I wasn't staring. I was leering.
All right fine, I pick you.|Y-Y-YEEESSS! Make "groom" for Chandler.
Sure.|What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.
But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?|No.
I don't get older. I just get better!|You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.|Walls are pretty thin, guys!
OH!|You look familiar, have we...
I think so.|Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
I don’t think you do.|You didn’t propose to me. Joey did.
No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.|Its such a slap in the face. I'm your sister and you would give your baby to these strangers over me.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|And what did she say?
Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!|Now... what do you think we should do?
No.|Oh, you're so screwed.
Uh-huh.|You're really not coming back?
Yeaah.|Oh, sweety, you can’t pull this off.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Which one are you?
Haha, no thanks!|That was a nice pep-talk.
A friend-ship...|It's like the cheapest college ever.
You do?!|Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
Hey, hey!|Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-
Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing around. I don't wanna mess this up again.|Me neither, okay? We are - we're done being stupid.
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!|What!? You faked it?
Hey, they were popular when I left!|Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
Bye, see ya.|How do you feel about all this?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.|Thank you!
Good weird?|Wonderful weird.
I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!|You ready to go?
Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.|That's great.  Can I see the book?
Wow! This place is beautiful!|I'm sorry, I don't own a TV.
What?|Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together. If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
I’m saying that… .|Man, tough week for Estelle!
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|How hard could it be? You do it.
Whoo-hoo!|Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!
Careful. <hands Chandler a china plate> Careful. CAREFUL!|I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..
It's to my apartment.|Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Top of act two. This is my entrance. You got it?
Yeaah.|Oh, I can’t, honey. I’m gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.  Oh... sure you wanna eat that?
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?|OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?
He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!|Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.
So, you lied to him?|What are you . ..� � Why are you dressed like that?
Interestingly... no.|Kinda playing fast and loose with the word "interesting".
Nighty-night!|What are you barking at?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|How is it going with Charlie?
Oh God!|Rach, I'm so sorry.
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?
Nighty-night!|Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
How can you come here?|How could you not tell me you worked here?
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!|That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!|Good for you Pheebs!
You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.|Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
Oh!|Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.|Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
Oh, this could take a while.|Get out of my line.
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.|That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?|Professor Geller?
Hey, hey!|I know… I mugged Ross!
No, that wouldn’t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.|I don’t know. She’s got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I’m guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she’s not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I’m gonna call her and hire her again.
Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!|Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.|But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.
Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.|Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
If you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend I swear to Lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers RIGHT NOW!|well Phoebe, I think you'll feel better when you know a little bit about Vicrum, His a Kite designer
Are you serious?|Oh my God.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|Food.
Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?|Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
Hey, you only heard Monica�s side of that. That little fatso was a terror.|Ish. I just don�t think I can bear it.
Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.|Ah, yes, The Plan!
WHAT! WHY?|well he seemed to bum hard that you'd never been in a serious relationship.
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|Look, we have enough, just walk away.
What are you taking amoxicillin for?|How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that�s
Well, welcome to the Winner Circle. Joey and Gene, you guys ready?|
Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!|Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
Seriously?|Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?|Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!
Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...|But, I mean, you have met... humans before, right? Look, why don't you go talk to my mom?
Who is it?|This is gonna make me very popular.
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!|Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces.
Ok. Oh God.  Get the camera, it’s in the diaper bag.|Ok!  Ow!
Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.|So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
You still don't know my name, do you?|I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
This room’s available.|Go get back on that case honey!
Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three.|Well... I like how you look, what are you?
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!|Uh, good hands.  Healing hands.
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|What was the other one Ross?
I wasn't. Let's get going!|Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|No, no, no.� When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . .� courtside!
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Yeah.� Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
Can I adopt you?|You know how to use a compass?
this is my wife, Nancy.|Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?|What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
Hi.|Above all, even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great, you never know! So, keep having sex on a regular basis.
Hey!|Oh, yeah, right! And after I took a shower this morning I just threw my towel on the floor! Oh God, it hurts to even joke about it.
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.|I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.
She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.|Okay I put most of the stuff away.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|Oh yeah? Since when?
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?|It's in Barbados.
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Courtside?� Oh my God.
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.|I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
Oh!|Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.|Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
Wher-where have you been?|Y�guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?
Oh... Okay, sorry!|Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape...
Oh yeah.|Haha!
What are you taking amoxicillin for?|Hi, and I am also Emma�s mother.
Hey Phoebe!|Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.|Ooh, what happened?
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|Uhm... Ha ha!
What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.|Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
No, I-I-I love it there.|Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
Yeaah.|Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.
It does, really?|Yeah.
I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!|I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion, I was looking at her skirt. Or was it pants? I didn't really see what happened below the ass area.
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!|That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
Hello... Hey, ok, stop screaming! Ok? So, halibut. All right, so salmon, either way. I don't-I don't... it doesn't matter to me!|Well, it matters to me!
We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time|So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
Oh well that’s what I thought about my first husband, now I’m lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.|Really?
Oh, why? What's up?|It was ok...
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.
Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?|Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.|How about tomorrow?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!
No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!|What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?
Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah!|Hey you guys I’m gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.
Everything was delicious!|What musician?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Hey Ross!
I know.|You know what? Uhm, I have some goodbye stuff that I wanted to say to each of you and I was gonna save it until the end of the night, but come here .
You are not at Thanksgiving?|No, we're late!
Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!|Well, do you wanna marry him?
Isn’t she beautiful?|What?! Why does she think that?
No, but you know what I mean.|Ross..
Oh! They're in the table!|Well, that can't be good!
Arghhh! Double standards!|While drinking...
Hey. Where've you been?|I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|Oh my God, Mike!
You have to get a ticket to get past security.|What? We're never gonna make it!
You gonna tell her?|Nope...  Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.
I think we found a place.|Okay.
Ok.|Oh, you’re not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...|No, no, it's not that.  Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.
What are you doing?|Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
Ok, we're still on that.|Tiny portions?
Wh-what's going on?|Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog.
I do love Mike.|Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.|All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?
You're mean!|Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller
A little more.|Okay.
If you want to check your email, just ask!|Oh, no, no, no dear God, no!
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|Oh, please darling, let's be honest. You can have all the... sailor fun you want with that one, but... let's be real...
There isn't a piano here.|That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
I'll let you get acquainted.|I don't think that's exactly...
Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.|Fine.
Oh hi, come on in. I'm Catherine, the listing agent.|Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Yeah, Ross is here so...|Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
Dad seriously! Y’know you really should see someone about that!|Noted.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!|Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!
You can't move. You just... you just can't.|You know, sometimes when I'm alone in my apartment, I look over here and you guys... are just having dinner or... watching TV or something, but... it makes me feel better. And now when I look over, who am I gonna see? The Gottliebs, the Yangs? They don't make me feel so good.
Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.|That's what we were gonna name the baby.
Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.|What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh?  I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on! Good God! You try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these, they'll snap like a piece of licorice.
Well, that's it. Everything's packed.|Wow, this is weird.
No it's not!|Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.
Yeah...|Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!" Huh!
Whoo-hoo!|I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.
Jack, look at this.|I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
Well, I guess they�re not coming. You wanna just order?|Thank you.
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|You put this on a sandwich.
Incentive For Men?|Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
Why?|I don�t know.
Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.|What is that?
May I help you?|Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
Miss?|Yes, I do.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.
All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life; my time-machine."|Did that movie ever get made?
You're not making the pies yourself?|This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
Oh thank you so much.|Thanks.....
It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.|Oh my God!
Thank you.|Yeah, I changed them. I-I sent you a fax about it!
Ah, so glad you decided to come.|Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
Hey, how was the Met?|The museum was amazing!
Ranion's theory of species variegation?|Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!
Good morning Phoebe.|Good morning receptionist.
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Salami, anchovies, jam!
I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."|Honey? Leave it to the pros.
You broke the pact!|Ross, that was 16 years ago!
Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.|Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.
Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right?� You go have fun.|Okay.� You too.� And I hope you score.�  Bye.
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|They went in together. So sorry.
Again, you're welcome.|Oh, you bought me a present! Why?
But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me we’re getting rid of her.|Joey, I can’t do that!
Okay.|You know what I really really want?
Ross...|This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!|My dad told me. They play golf together.
Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?|We weren't doing anything!
Hi!|Hey.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|What? What carrer?
Oh! That feels sooo good!|Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!
Hi there!|Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?
Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...|Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|I got that!
Ah, let me see!  Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?|I think I am.
Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?|I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.
Yeah, his name is Ross.  What?|Oh, nothing, it’s just, it’s close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
Isn’t she beautiful?|Well, what did she say?
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.
Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!|She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.|I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
Hey Joey, want come with me to… are you ok?|Yeah, I just… I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
What do you really want to do?|No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
There. Here's their card.|Hey!
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|My God! Aren't you freezing?
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.|That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!
If you hold a spider.|WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
What about your massage client?|What?
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|See ya. Well, this is just us.
Of course, I'd be honored!|Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!
No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.|Why?
Level 1 alert. I repeat, level 1. This is not a drill. Okay we've got a situation. The minister just called. He's snowed in. He can't make it.|Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.
Oh... Okay, sorry!|There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Thank you.|I can't believe we're gonna be the only people that aren't in this wedding.
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.|Hey, how'd the interview go?
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|Oh
Hey!|Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Did you tell her what we talked about?
I can't imagine what he sees in her.|She actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his.  Oh, hello dear...
So, you lied to him?|Achhh.� It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.� � Except with you.
How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you slept together last night.|Yeah, and she still wants to go! It's pretty clear where she is.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|uh huh.
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?|No.
That’s fine, for now we’ll just call her Baby Girl Green.|Hello baby girl.
Yeah uh look Rach, there’s something I gotta tell ya.|It’s all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but don’t worry. It’ll happen.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.
What?!|You were gonna propose to me?
Oh my God!|Excellent!
Yeah.|Really? Excited?
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|So who's gonna tell them?
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|I think I'm gonna take off.
It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.|Sorry.
I have to break up with Charlie?|Hey, you got one right!
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!|Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
Your age?|I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.
If you want I could loan you some money?|Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.
You didn't like that?|Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second .
You still don't know my name, do you?|Clever.  So how are you?
Why don't you tell her my name?|Crap Bag?
It's really gone?|Yeah, well you should! I mean, nude pictures of Anna Kournikova? I mean, she's never even won a major tournament!
Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.|Oh man, I can't believe you guys are leaving this place.
What?|Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|I do.
|That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
If you want to check your email, just ask!|Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.|Wha... what you really think we can do that?
well watching sharks? Are you sure that's what he was doing?|: do you know how many times I've seen him jump up like that, believe me I know what he was doing.
Hey!|Hey!
well then I didn't need to bother you or the four other Mike Hanagens I bothered.|hey wait wait wait wait wait! Is that true what you said Phoebe's never had a serious relationship?
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!|I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!|I can’t. Please, you do it for me.
Molly ... people don't study acting ...|Sure, I'll go check on Emma.
No.|Hey. What was that all about?
Hey guys!|Hi!
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Oh, that's crazy!
Huh, and no cuddling.|And no kissing your neck.
This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.|Why would he break up with me?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|I know, she's been such a big part of my life. And it feels like when Melrose Place got cancelled.  I mean... oh, forget it. I miss Melrose Place!
Me.|Really?
So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...|Oh... Well...
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.|God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
Here goes...|I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.
Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!|Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.
She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.|In the hospital.
Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.|I don't understand.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hello? Yeah, um. Hang on one sec. <to Ross and Rachel> Can I take this upstairs?
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.|<points to Chandler> This guy? Seriously?
Hey guys!|Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state.  And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.|Was your cabin pressurised?
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.|I beg to differ .
What?|That's impossible.
I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.|Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
You got to tell me exactly what to do there.|Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
Spend more time with the tie. That�ll make a baby.|Look, I can�t do this. I can�t make luv to you while we�re fighting this way.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?
What does she do there?|Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
Well, the club lost it's power.|I know.
Yeah.|I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.
No, no, look. All I’m saying is that you’re my agent, ok? And you’re not getting me into any auditions and I’m tired of it.|What are you saying?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|A spoon. Your hands. Your face!
That sounds like fun.|Hey! Hi, how's my girl?
You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.|Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?|Amen.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Great! I'll call ya!
Chandler, you don't wanna miss this. This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!|Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|I really doubt that.
You guys, what was the Powerball number again?|Seven.
This place is awesome!|Ah, this place is great!
That sounds like fun.|Ta-daaa!
Well umm, if you have sometime y’know and maybe you might want to visit someone else…|Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.|I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
Oh screw her, that part is mine!|Right...  ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.|Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
You were going to cut me out?|Well...kinda.
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
I'll tell you at the wedding.|I want you to be Crazy Bitch again.
Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?|Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
I wasn't. Let's get going!|No, not yet.
Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin!|Why!?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
Nighty-night!|Right.
Arghhh! Double standards!|Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Uh.. who has to die for me to get her?
Oh, you did it!|It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|"Wendy" is a fat girl name.
What...how is it going with Drake?|Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!|No, I couldn't let you do that.
Oh... then I overpaid.|Well, I would like to have the option!!
About what?|He slept with you and then never called you.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.
You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them.|Okay, what did we say was your one gift to us?
We're back!|Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
Sex!|Seriously, answer faster!
Hey, hey!|A superhuman thirst for knowledge.
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.
I say ‘cheesy line’, but ok.|What’s the matter?
She's still at dinner?|I guess. Why? Who's she with?
Okay...|Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?
Aww!|Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...|Right!
Oh and you know what, it will be even better tomorrow, because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet. .|Hey guys!
Oh... Okay, sorry!|What?
We'll call you!|Okay.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Rachel?
What? What's the matter?|What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|And about this Nancy thing... If you're not sleeping with her, should I?
Hey! How was lunch?|
How do you think I should propose?|David, I'm pretending to read here!!
No, but you know what I mean.|It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
Oh!|Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!
No, you didn’t!|Hey, she just woke up! She’s hungry. Why don’t we give this another try?
So, you lied to him?|Hey!� Open the door.� What's going on?�
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?
Really? Even more humiliating than…|Hey, let's not do this!
Oh, look at these little bunnies!|I know! You ready to trade?
Oh my God!|And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat!
O-okay.  So, is she gonna take the test?|Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?|Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.|Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
Oh yeah!|Right, fine, I�ll do it, but no talking.
Can somebody please go in?|Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.|I think you're better than you think you are.
Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.|Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Don't touch my coat!
What did you do to my mom?|Not her!
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.|Hi Amy!
Nighty-night!|Joey? How could you just let them leave?
Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.|Hey, there's Phoebe! Is that Mike she's with?
No, that seems about right.|Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Hey, where's Rach?
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|Whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t think so! Aren’t you ovulating?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
Thank you guys for having us over.|You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.|I'm kind of funny looking.
Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.|I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
Why not?|Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani . Hey, why don’t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|Cut! That was good.  That was very good. You did everything I asked for.
How's it going?|Good. I'm just getting some coffee. So I'm alert for the wedding.
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|This is how I look when I'm turned on!
What's going on?|You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!|Stinky?!
Hey!|Hi!
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...|Oh, that's really ok.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|...should be playing with the star of "General Hospital" Leslie Charleson.  Welcome everybody. Good luck to all of you. Let's play Pyramid. All right? Now... we flipped a coin before the show, Gene, you won the toss, so you're gonna start. Which category would you like?
Yay!|Oh, just tell us! We’re not gonna want it!
OH!|No, I told you...get out!
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|I decided to pee.
We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!|I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
Ok, not that you need it but good...GOD!Is that Chase Lassiter?He's straight, right?|Rach, I gotta say...if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay I don't know if I could do this!
Chandler gets pedicures!|Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|HI!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|I got it! How about, if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster?
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!
Ok, we're still on that.|Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?|A doctor at this hospital?
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious  That's not how she used it...?
What?|ALL FOOD!
Hey!|You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!
Monica!|Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|What the hell is that dog doing here?!
Will the stable boy never get the princess??|What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|oh... hi.. <goes to Rachel with open arms>
I know, I hate being left out of things.|Hey guys, how is it going?
Should we send something?|How did the job stuff go?
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp!  Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.|Ohhh!  Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn’t he?
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|Hey.
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.|Yeah, is that okay?
Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!|Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...|Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Oh, yeah.|She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.|Hello.
Aah... I bet you're right.|So...
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?|Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
Okay Marjorie, hit it.|It's the dog.
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Ugh.
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.|One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this.
It's never gonna happen again right?|I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number
Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say "neither".|I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.
Yeah!|has your girlfriend got the butt?
Huh?|I never stopped loving you.
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.|Connected? I mean.. to what? She's.. she's  a lump.
Going go to the bathroom.|Well, I think you should wait.
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.|What?
You might want to keep practicing.|All right, I'm going in.
Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you, don't I?|Hi!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.|Ooh... Dr. Geller!
Oh, time's up! Joey! You were, uh, almost on a roll there...|Yeah...
Ah, yeaaah!|DO YOU?
Oh man.|I know that too.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Yeah, sure!
No it is awesome!|Hi guys.
Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?|I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
What are you guys doing?|All right, Rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there's a lot to do. Now, Ross, you got Geller blood, you're in charge of these yahoos!
Oh!|Joey. Erica, baby!
I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...|Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?|Yeah! I think that's great!
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
Kiss him, you fool!!|What?
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?|Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.|That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?
Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!|Fine.
Bye.|Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Please?
Do you have to go?|Not you.
: how do you know I have one of those?|
Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?|Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...
Alright. My job here is done.|Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!
I'm *happily* married.|Oh. - What's *that* like?
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|I'll do it!
Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.|Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
Alright-y then.|But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
I understand...|Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|O-Okay!
That sounds like fun.|Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.
Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.|What? You really think she's hot?
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
Oh!|Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?
What? Who?|The guy you gave your number to.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|PHOE-BE.
Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!|Well, I-I said yes.
Thank you guys for having us over.|No, no. I-I'm good.
Eww!|Well, what happened?
Oh man.|I know.
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.|I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
You guys, we�ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.|No, no, it�s okay, I already told the waiter what they want.
We’re seriously asking for our money back?|So you’re asking us to refund your donation to the children?
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!
Hey, finished my recommendation.  Here. And I think you’ll be very, very happy. It’s the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.|I don’t... uh... understand.
It's a... It's a boy!|Is he okay?
I got it.|So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?
Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.|Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...
Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!|So? What do you think?
What?!|What?!
I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.|Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying "Go to your room! You're grounded"?
No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.|Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.
Hey, what are you doing?|That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
No. Here|HEY!
All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica|Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn"
Oh, we are so lucky!|Okay.
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
Ye....|
So, I guess you're next. You're ready?|Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years.
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.|Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!|Cool!
Honey, that's gorgeous!|Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!
Why?!!|Uh well umm…we’re just not in that place, y’know? But we’re very excited about this.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|What?
Did she go out with him?|No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
Oh, water would be fine.|Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We’re really excited about getting this process started.
You got sprayed with two two' s and...|I'm a four?
Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!|Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
I got you something from Vermont!|Sheldon Epps
How do you know about that?|Emma.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
Your age?|Thank you.
I love you.|I love you.
Hey!|The three of us?
So... how many guys have your key?|No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.
Okay, okay... Okay, I feel a little better.|Ooh! Are you sure?
Totally.|Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|Hey.
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?|Good to see you, too.
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|Damn it.
Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?|Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!|Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmental
It�s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it�s like you lose a boyfriend,|Uh-ah!
Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...|Damnit. OH!  Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
Oh, incredible! Oh! Champagne, candle-lit dinners, moonlight walks on the beach, it was sooo ro-man-tic!|Oh!
...Valentine's day...|Oh yeah!
Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe...|Seriously, we're gonna do this?
Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?|Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.
You're fly is open, Geller!|You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!|Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
Phoebe did the signs!|Oh you guys thanks for doing this.
m'ap|mah
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|What, you, you really quit your job?
Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out.  You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.|The job is in Paris.
Incentive For Men?|She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!
Well, I bet you are all thinkin' "Now would be a really great time for an intermission", huh?|oh yes, God yes!!
oh it was great.|: Here why don't you sit down, get yourself comfortable because I.  have a little surprise for you.
I understand...|I have a date.
No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...|Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?
Oh, she’s so beautiful.|Here.
You were under the pile of coats?|I was the pile of coats!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Amy. I'm going to save you some time, ok. <spins finger around in circle> All me.
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.|Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.|Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both.
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!|Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..|Oh! That is so thoughtful.
What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.|Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|I'll take care of it
Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?|If I help, we can find 'em faster!
Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!|You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite!  Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.|Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
Are you on board?|Yes.
What if he reads it in the paper?|Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?|I�m so sorry �
Oh... then I overpaid.|Hey, what's this?
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!
I can't think of anything.|Thanks!
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|Not it! Damn it!
Oh, it's fine.� Actually, I, I invited Mike over.|Phoebe's Mike?
Arghhh! Double standards!|Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.|Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...
What?|Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.
I'm sorry, what?|Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.
Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.|Ok...
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|Lucky bastard!
Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.|Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...|So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|Yeah, and y’know what? I love them both, so why don’t you just pick one and that’ll be it.
Yes|I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
Nighty-night!|Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.|Don't you just love it?
Oh... oh...|Yeah, I should have told you.
God, I wish Mike were here.|Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Help me.
Oh, damn it!|Game, point!
Oh sure, now you�re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle�s funeral|That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I�m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?
Oh, no! Who did that?|Chandler... hey...
Thanks!|What's wrong? Are you okay?
Hi.|Hi.
I'm still looking through mine...|Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
Previously on Friends...|So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
Hey!|Interesting...
Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. .|Ah-haah! I win!!
All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.|I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?|Oh yeah, let's do that!
Ross! She's giving us her baby. She can eat you if she wants.|I'll be right back.
Wow!� That didn't take long.� I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.|Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
Oh no, she took down Monica... And I'm the crier in the family. Oh God! I could be next. Maybe she won't talk with me if it looks like we're deep in converstation. Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It really made me think about that other thing.|Uh, Rach?
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|What?
Oh, my first love!|Oh!
From... Cosmo??|Yeah, yeah... It's... "climax your way to better skin".
Previously on Friends...|You okay with this?
Previously on Friends...|Good for you!
Well, it�s too late now.|Well, ??? think that�s us?
So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?|Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
Archery?|No.
Uhuh.|All right, I trust you.
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!|This is so cool!
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?|Yes!
Previously on Friends...|Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|Okay, you're on.
Nighty-night!|A monologue? I don't have..  Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.|Yeah. I'm sorry too. I'm even more sorry that that phone call didn't come before I told you about looking through the window.
Wh-what's going on?|I thought you came to say you were sick.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|"Pick up grandma at the airport"?
Isn’t she beautiful?|And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|What? Yes, I am!
Oh, ok, which one?|Uh, why, it’s a... . And while he rocked her, he sang “I’ll love you forever, I’ll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you’ll be”.
No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you|Why?
Your place is just lovely.|Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?|
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Oh, Monica made me send her to my mother's. Apparently babies and weddings don't mix.
Wow! So, how are you?|I'm, I'm okay.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|So?
I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.|Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
Isn’t she beautiful?|Yay! It’s so exciting! Wow, you could’ve done that with us there.
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|But hey, it's courtside.� The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . � That's not the way to convince you.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Oh.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|We got the house.
Estrangement .|But it happens?  I�m gotta go to the bathroom.
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.|Yeah!
Hey!|I know... Honey, seriously, I did it all. The luggage that I'm taking is in the bedroom, this is Emma's Paris stuff, these are the boxes that I'm having shipped, and that's the sandwich that I made for the plane...
I'm out of here|It was nice meeting you!
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.
What do you really want to do?|Thanks!
Hey!|Hey!
What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!|Barbados.
What are you doing?|Hey!
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|"I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now."
Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?|Oh no, we have to!
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!|Hi, glad you could come.
Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.|I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed
ROSS!|Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|So, a professor, uh?
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?|Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
Wiener, Wiener!!!|Rachel!!!
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.|Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!|I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
It's just a little bit more, honey.|Help me! This hurts!
Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?|Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We’re very proud of it.
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Monica.
Okay. Oh, yeah...  Oh he's cute!|So... your resumé is quite impressive.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Again, what?!
That was a test and you just failed.|I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.|Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
Yeah! It really has been great too, you know, some of this people must have seen me play before because they were requesting a bunch of my songs! Yeah, "You suck" and "shut up and go home".|Listen Phoebe...
If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.|I've lost the will to live.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!|Hi!
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy.
Joey, give me the bag.|Hit me!
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.|Ooh, maybe that's him!
I said it's still nap time.|Joey, NO!
Hey!|Hey!
I’m in the middle…|Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|That's different! I was drunk and stupid!
Well, the club lost it's power.|Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.
this is my wife, Nancy.|Hey, you ok?
Ooh, Joey.|Hey.
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.|No.
Hey!|At what point did it stop being funny that I took her passport?
Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it.|Sorry...we were just leaving
Well, I hope, you got some room left.|That�s the best birthday ever.
Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine!  Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!|That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?
Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy...|Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.
Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.|What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?|No...
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|What room should we see next?
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
Hi.|Umh... Kurts Baley?
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.|Ross!
Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?|Ok.
No|oh it's just you have that look
No, you don't! She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's... It's a city of Gunthers!|Hey!
Uh-huh.|Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
Hey Joe!|Hey!
Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?|I am happy.
She's yours!|SHE'S YOURS!
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Alright, wait, so what you're saying is that the chef is at the Hamilton Club, but the food is not and the drinks are there, but the bartender is not? Are you, are you FREAKING KIDDING ME!?
So, you're ready to do this?|Oh, thank you.
...If-you-say-so.|All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?
Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of...  Hey!|I'm in college and I'm in a band.
No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.|Hello! I just go and get Emma.
All right.|Have fun.
Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!|Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.|I just can't believe this... Why?
What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross’s baby! It’s-it’s so inappropriate. No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong. It’s… It is bigger than mine!|I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.
Well, this is very generous!|And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Nice to see you.
EH, what do you know!|You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
Ok...|This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
Good job.|Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?
Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?|Y’know what? This one is.
Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?|Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Heey man, I work out.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.
Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.|Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|We sure are.
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.|Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Emma.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
Yeah... Now I have something...|I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.|Damn it!
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.|Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.
No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.|Good morning!
Do you have to go?|There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
Previously on Friends...|Yeah, yeah!  You sure this is what you want?
What? They will be!|All right, that’s it, I’m getting out of here.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
Uh!|Still on Amelia Earhart?
Nighty-night!|Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|That's some gentle comedy, dude.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!|Always nice to meet a fan!
She has a lot of crap!|Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.
Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.|The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn!
Whoa! You were down on one knee?|Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn’t…I didn’t propose!
No it is awesome!|Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?|SON OF A BITCH!  (To the
Oh!|Why would you say that?
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.|Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|Hey!
What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like|You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|Ok, I'm gonna take off.
Hey Phoebe.|Hey. Everything ok?
You still don't know my name, do you?|Oh.
Alright-y then.|Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.|Really? Did you count Mississipily?
Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress.  Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!|Uvula!
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?|No!
Oh... That's true.|Thank you!
What? Hey, hey, listen..|Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hi.
What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.|My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.|Word!
|Welcome home. I�ve missed you. join me in the bedroom?
So seriously...rodeo clown?|One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
Hey, hey!|Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony… I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer…
pelle|pel.
well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!|: Ok
Do you have to go?|No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!
Oh!|Look at Emma!
You might want to keep practicing.|NO!
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!|What are you talking about?
I'm still looking through mine...|Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.|Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
Don�t joke  with me, okay? I�m very, very upset right now.|Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?
I am Mike.|Atta boy!
Everything doesn't sound fine!|You can't make this stuff up!
What about your massage client?|I've been here the whole time!
Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?|Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|So I guess we’re back to uh, Baby Girl.
Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.|M-m.
You still don't know my name, do you?|I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!|But I insist harder!
Calm ourselves?|Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
|No thanks, I�m good.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Yeah I.. I think so. <sticks her hand out to shake hands with Phoebe and says to her> It's nice to meet you Emma.
Hi, Mike's place.|Hey, it's Mike.
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family.
What did you get her?|But equally real!
Nighty-night!|Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?|It's over/Joe!
Count of three?|One!
Hey, hey!|That's it.
Olivia.|Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.
Wh… wh…what?|When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn’t that great?
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.|Morning.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.
I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...|Feel me up?
Everything was delicious!|It was. The duck in particular was superb.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.|Stupid Gap on every corner!
What's going on?|Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
It was ...  oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just "Tag". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.|But it was a deap meaningful relationship.
Yeah, Ross is here so...|Pants off Bing!
Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.|What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?
That’s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.|Thankfully you don’t need me at all .
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself <Ross and Rachel knock on wood> um you wouldn't get the baby.
Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?|Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...
Oh, I hear divorce bells.|Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|I never want to leave you again!
Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!|NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.|I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.
Uh-hmm.|I love you so much.
Okay.|Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.
Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!|It was Jones.
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.|What is with you?
You still don't know my name, do you?|Ross, what is taking you so long?
I guess so, can I. can I think it's cool that you kiss me and also wanna kiss you again  and umm, be a little concerned about the magic markers.|Definitely
Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?|Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.
Ross?|Ross?  Can we just close the door?
Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!|Well, I've never gone this fast before.
Molly ... people don't study acting ...|Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!|No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
So, you're ready to do this?|Oh Phoebe, I'm so happy for you honey.
Good weird?|Honey don’t worry, it was my mistake.
You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.|Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
Oh, we are so lucky!|I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What are you doing?|What are you guys doing?
Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?|Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!|Yeah. What are we gonna do?
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|No!
Okay.|I'm serious!
You need both hands for that?|I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.
Hell yeah!|So shake it!
I said it's still nap time.|What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
I’m gonna go.|No, come on Ross!  Look, Ross, we have to get past this.
Look. Phoebe, I-I love you. Very much. But I never want to get married again.|Oh. Wow.
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!|SARAH!
Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?� I mean, they said thirty minutes or less.� Well, how long has it been?|� And now twelve.� So, do you like the beer?
All right, all right, all right, let's play one more time, ok? And remember, if I win you do not move to Paris.|Ok! Can't believe I'm risking this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.
Well, not anything, I mean...|Yeah... anything.
Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...|Monica told me you had a blind date.
Do you have any ideas?|Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!|So now, what are you doing here?
All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.|Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
Hi|How was the honeymoon?
Jack, look at this.|
Wow, so glad I changed. Almost wore my ??? outfit that can�t contain my breasts.|This is not, what I�m wearing. I�m ovulating and Chandler�s gonna be home any minute, so I thought we would try before dinner.
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!|So how's the piano playing going?
I have to go to the bathroom.|I can hear traffic and birds!  I can hear the voices in my head again!
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|What is so funny about that?
We'll call you!|Have fun at church-camp!
Well it stupid, unfair question!|
You took the same class twice.|Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
You're not making the pies yourself?|2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
Who's that?|I ordered Chinese food.
Wha... what do you mean?|It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
I'm still looking through mine...|Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
Nice to meet you.|Yes, yes, you did.
Yay.|Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Peeeeeooooooooch  "Hang up that phone!" One take!
Look it's not about who I would marry. And I was certain the first time I got married it would last forever. And I was totally wrong!|But it's just...
Believe me, if I did see with someone, there’s no way I...|WHO DID YOU SEE HIM WITH?
Great, ok faster! "je"|je.
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.|Wow.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
Amy, hi!|I took your advice, I left Myron.
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.|I'll...
What are they?|What am I supposed to do with these?
Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!|Awesome, the name really stands out.
Nighty-night!|Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?|Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.|I know, right?  Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?
Oh, thanks guys!|I thought... it was wonderful!
What are those?|I don't know but they don't sound like spa treatments. You have to get rid of it!
Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.|Because of Emma.
I have nothing to say to you.|Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.
And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.|So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.|Yeah...
I can't believe this.|But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|What?
Honey, you're screaming.|YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.
Thank you!|Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
Yeah! This feels really good.|Hey, that’s not fair! A person’s wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn’t have a graduation party! And I didn’t go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to “kill me” or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|God she is unbelievable.
Ok|Ok ...  Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.
Really?|Uhuh.
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?|Hey!
Bye, see ya.|Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.|Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|Hey, well, in a couple of weeks I won't be able to travel.
Hey, hey!|Hey, you'll never guess what just happened… Phoebe and I got mugged!
We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.|Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?
Okay...|And she's a little mannish...
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|OK Thanks.
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?|I know, it's pretty great.
Yay.|Excuse me, sir, where are you going?
Really?|No!
Hey, hey!|Why?
It's just a cold|Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
We need to talk to you about something.|What?
Thank you. I got a job in advertising.|Oh, honey, that's incredible!
Oh, give me!|Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.|Yeah, I thought we'd be groomsmen, but wouldn't they have asked us by now? When did they ask you to be their bridesmaid?
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.|Uhm... no. Although I did have an uncle who voted for Dukakis.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hi.
No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.|Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
What about your massage client?|NO, no science camp!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|He's right, man.
Ewww, is that what that is?|Sorry!
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|Blueberry.
Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.|So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy...|Hey!
Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?|Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?|Well then why did you give me a ring?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Paper, snow, a ghost!
I know.|A meatball Sub? Thanks!
What?|Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
Hands.|816, thank you!
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.
I don't know.� We could look it up.|Things are about to get wild.
Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?|Look at this. My two best friends!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Okay.  And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.|Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|No, I'm not talking about you. <to Rachel> It was your fat
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
Hello?|Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
The Metsss!|Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don�t know if I can take anymore|Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!|Alright here’s something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|Phoebe is going to say "yes"? That's, that's great!
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.|She does?
Thats not how you see me, is it?|I lie better then that, right?
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.|Why do you care so much?
I just talked him into it, don’t tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.|I just don’t know! It just doesn’t feel right.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
... is it weird that it's not with each other?|Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
There. Here's their card.|Thanks.
Ranion's theory of species variegation?|So, did you two have fun?
Yay!|Well, I’ll just ask for it back!
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Well, I do bring a certain credibility to the role.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Uh.... its Emma.
Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.|Man, those two dogs are going at it!
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Really?
I've got good news!|You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Shocking!
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.|It's pretty much all the information you need.
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.|I don't see her.
I am not doing this over the phone.|Yeah.
Yeah.|It's his dad.
Hey, here you go.|Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.
OOH! God! Sorry!|I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!|It does?
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.|Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
You stepped on my egg roll?|I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what…|Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!
I lent them to Ross.|I left them at the park.
You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.|
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Thank you so much!
|
You really think so?|Hey!
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.|Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
Nighty-night!|Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
I'm still looking through mine...|Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys.  Hey, Steve.
And the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  What were the things you said?|Don’t you love the huge yard?
At least you took me down with you!|I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?
I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!|Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.
Hey!|Hey!
Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?|Are you kidding, I love it!
Oh, you did it!|Well, that's spongy.
My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.|Oh, thank you.
Arghhh! Double standards!|It's just, I'm not good at singing.
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|No, no, it's not, don't listen to him!
You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one|It�s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
Puerto Rican.|Two, I think a two.
But you two were supposed to be together.|Well, I thought so too, but then she said she’d marry you.
Come on, Ross, that didn’t mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.|Yeah that’s what she said.
NO!|ADRIENNE TURNER!!
I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.|Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
Thank you so much for this.|Oh, d'you like it?
Hey!|Hey.
yeah I really, really need to talk to you about something.|Ok, unless you're not gonna try to get me to join a cult are you?
That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.|Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.
Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.|Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!
Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.|Thanks doctor.
Good for you. That was really mature.|You're a strange kind of grown-up.
Again, you're welcome.|Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . "From Gavin"
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?|He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.
'Cause we will appreciate it more when she’s gone?|No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.
There it is, you're blushing!|No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.
Then what did happen?|Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t!  Well then why didn’t you tell me that before?!
Yay!|I don’t think you can do that!
Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said|Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,
|I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
I got bottled breast milk.|Eh, why don't we start with the beer?
Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.|This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners.  Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.|Joey, you're so sweet.
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Yah, I�ll have the soup and the salmon.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
What are you talking about? These aren't mine.|Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!
She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.|Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!|Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?|Yes you did!
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Hmm, the game's at one.
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.|Well thank you, I'll give you a tour later. It's actually three floors.
Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?|Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...
You told us both we could be in the wedding?|Rachel, only one of us can do it, you have to choose. You and me together again.
Yeah, yeah, and directing.|Ah!
Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!|Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.|That's really nice.
so how'd the date go?|well it was awful every time I thought about what you said I started crying.
They could be our neighbors, what are they like?|Sure.
No, I arranged that...|Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.
I hope Ross isn't too upset.|Tell me about it.
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!|What?
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|I... I don't know..
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
Oh sure.�|Oh my God, you're giving your real number.
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?|Yes, you did!
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.|Seriously?
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...|Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.
One thousand...|To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
Okay, my turn. My turn.  I won’t.|What’s the matter?
...I hate waste.|...Ross?
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?|What's going on?
Well it stupid, unfair question!|What the hell are doing?!!
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.|Hey dad!
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|
I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.|Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|Phoebe is going to say "Yes" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...|Oh my God! Chandler!
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.|Me too.
Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.|Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?
Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.|Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question.  Do you guys do random drug testing?
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.|Well, I’m staying with you guys!
Oh, Rachel!|Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.
Incentive For Men?|Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?
Hey!|Oh hi.
Arghhh! Double standards!|I thought you hated him?
Hey!|Okay.
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.|Ah.
All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?|I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.|Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?|Well, this is going well.
DO NOT DISTURB DO NOT DISTURB! Monica:|: is everything all right?
Oh no no no|So I had fun last night
You really should have been more clear about that!|Hey!
Bye, see ya.|What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!
Have you seen him throw a ball?|Is Rachel here?
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|How's that?
Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...|Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?
Phoebe did the signs!|Look at all the stuff people sent!
What?|Ah, it’s beautiful.
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.|I know. Have you considered pageanting?
Miss? Are you boarding the plane?|Hey, hey. I know you love me. I know you do.
Oh yeah! Hey, save the cork and then we can fill the bottle with water and put it back so they don't charge you.|Oh my God, I love you.
You're late!|I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?
Uh... What can I do for you?|Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.|Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Hey!
Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. <pinches Ross' arm>|Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring!|So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or  Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?|Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later!
So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!|Yeah...
You sure you're alright?|Yep.
And the fireplace in the bedroom.|And Nancy said that it's really under price, because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents!
Hey.|Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?|That's not what we talked about!!
Oh, look at her, so happy!|No, he’s picking up dinner, why, what’s up?
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this|Oh? Isn�t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
Yay.|I wouldn't worry about it. She's always coming up with stuff like this, and you know what? She's almost never right.
Yes, it's also 2003.|Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can’t sleep without it.|Oh, well, she’s asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
Whenever you're ready Joey.|I'm sorry, what's going on?
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!|Umm, she Rach, not it, she.
Yay!|Well what are we going to do?
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?
Yeah, but you can't do that.|Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.|It really was.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|What?
Hey.|Hey.
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?|Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, it�s chilling.|I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.
Previously on Friends...|Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
I'm crazy about her.|And she feels the same way?
There isn't. There is totally isn't.|You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|uhm... Is everything okay?
I understand...|Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.|We really need to take those tests?
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Where is Emma?
Oh, I like my job.|
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Ew! Gross.
It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!|You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
That’s it? That’s why you won’t go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!|Hey, hey, look! It’s not about a few fries... it’s about what the fries represent.
Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?|That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
: how do you know I have one of those?|I would love to go out with you.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Hi! Oh my gosh!
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Uh-huh... right... yeah...
Yeah, who is that?|Do ya?
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Hey, I'm not that fond of you either, ok buddy? But I'm just trying to be nice for the kids!
Oh, good for you!|I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!|Have I got a surprise for you? Pack your bags!
I'm not going along with some lie you made Ross, No I'm just gonna be honest with him.|Good yeah just be honest with him.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Ew. <walks into Rachel's room, I'm guessing>
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to come over>
Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.|Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!
You might want to keep practicing.|Look I, I can't.� What's going on?
We only ordered one!|You know it's twins, right?
Good weird?|No, Rach, I should’ve told you sooner. It’s just that…Man! That kid is going to town!
|
No, I arranged that...|The game's over! Take off your robe!
Thank you for letting us see the house again.|Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.
Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.|Oh...
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|I have a question I was kinda gonna ask her myself.
Okay.|Okay, you ready?
No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.|So, tell me about it.
Oh. You mind if I join you?|Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.
Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.|Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
I can say I told you so but she’s kinda doing that for me.|Oh I’m sorry mummy’s so sorry go back to sleep go back to sleep. Shh.   Shhh! Go back to sleep
Hi!|Hey.
I'm the hell person whose office this is!|Good one, Rach.
Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?|Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
Miss?|I'm sorry.
You really think so?|Hi!
Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!|Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
Yes, it was.|No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old…
Congratulatioooons!|Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
Oh my God!|Relax! We just get her some antacids.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
Hey!|What? Maybe I put it in here . Oh, oh, it's not in there! Oh, no! I must have packed it in one of these boxes!
No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.|You sure?
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.|Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.|Mrs Hannigan?
Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.|Okay.
Yeah...|And you are...
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?
let ME be a part of this!|: I saw what you were doing in Tulsa. angry sharks turn you on!
Oh my God! You got her to stop crying!|Yes I did, I’m Monica, Super Aunt
Can I offer you a drink?|Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book...
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
Sure.|Oh, that was our favourite game show ever!
Joey, we know that's you.|no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|Don't go.
What are you doing here?|Phoebe called me.
Yeah.|I did, too.
Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.|Phoebe!
Okay, that helps.|Cut!
Oh.|But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
Oh!|The cranberries...?
I know, I still need to talk to you.|Oh hey but, before you guys do that  I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.
Sorry!|Well this is romantic!
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!
Oh, thank you. I hope... I hope you know how much you mean to me.|I don't want you to see your father cry, GO TO YOUR ROOM!
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|We can have any future you want.
Previously on Friends...|Of course we can. Congratulations.  Joey...
Well, it's a little low... pick up a little...  Now throw it away!|C'mon! This looks good!
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|No, you gotta pick one!
Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?|Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead.  Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|Can I ask you a question?
Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?|Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
No one, I’m just saying if...|TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW!
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|Joseph.
Incentive For Men?|I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.|You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!|Ross...
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|I don't know all the words.
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?|I don't know!
I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?|Done. Oh good, really?
Your age?|The cold weather hurts my hip!
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.
Well, that’s what I’m here for.  Want me to get that?|No its really okay… Monica!
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|I put it on to scare Chandler!
Awe!  Oh my God! Looks, she’s a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?|Oh, absolutely!
Isn’t she beautiful?|Well of course Ben, I meant my first granddaughter.  Wow.
Ok!|Why?
Seriously?|You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if… You’re wearing the ring.|Wh-what’s that?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|no, no, then I would get the baby. I mean you know it would be just like a movie. Like at first I wouldn't know what to do with her, then I would rise to the occasion and and then I would get a makeover and then I'd get married.
Isn’t she beautiful?|It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!
Whoo-hoo!|You're kicking me out?
Hey!|Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.
Uh, no.� I just left.|Well, you have to go back in.
All right.|It's gonna be so hot!�
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|I can't believe we are at a real college party!  I have to pee so bad!
You didn't like that?|Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Really?
She has a lot of crap!|She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.
Well, now’s a good time. I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.|Joey asked me marry him.
Oh!|He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
Oh right, right.� � So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?|Yeah, yeah.� Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun.� And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.|What do you think?
Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go  ohhhh!|So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
Yay.|Yeah, okay.
Uh huh...we're playing you two.|I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Because you don't want me to be happy. You.. you have always been jealous of me.
I lent them to Ross.|Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
No, I-I-I love it there.|That's Hugo Boss?
Well, I took it.|YAY! WHOO! YAY!
We’re seriously asking for our money back?|Gay, go.
Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.|Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.
All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.|Hey.
I am not doing this over the phone.|For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.
Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.|No you didn't.
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!|Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?
...If-you-say-so.|So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Great.
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?|Yes, you did!
Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?|You dropped it off?
Yay.|Yeah! The left Philange!
You still don't know my name, do you?|Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?|Hey!
Are they still looking for us?|I don't think they saw us.
I know.|Seriously you guys, what's going on? What are these for?
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.|I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.
Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway… and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.|Is it a good play?
Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.|Not necessary.
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
Damnit!|Hey!
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!|Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
Sure.|Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.
I am Mike.|Okay, look...
Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?|Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
Hey, hey!|Yeah?
You really think so?|I'm telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song.  "Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."
this is my wife, Nancy.|Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Paper, snow, a ghost!
Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.|Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture,
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.

Bye, see ya.|All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?
A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.|Who's Gladys?  Oh! What a tragic loss!
Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.|I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.|The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. <whiny voice> And they all got to meet Santa!
Really?|Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?|Tsz... NO! .
Oh... Okay, sorry!|Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?
Hey, hey!|No… actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street… that's where stabby Joe works.
Hi!|So you gave in and decided to call someone?
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|I bet you did!
That's terrible!|Oh yeah?

Yay.|There is no Philange!
Wow.� So, what did you guys do?|Well, good bye.

Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|That must have been one lousy movie.
I was in the car with Nancy all day.|Nancy doesn’t smoke!

Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
Oh.|He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he’s not into anything weird sexually.
All right, all right.|What?
Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.|No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Hey Rach, hey you.
Jack, look at this.|To be fair this one does have nuts.
I know I am!  ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?|It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Hey! I-I-I don't care if he's hot, you know. If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.  This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?|Heeeyy! Hey!
Great! Come on in!|Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!
No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.|You're not serious, right?
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.|Seriously, where did this happen?
Do you think I'm someone else?|Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
Just give us the cheapest room you have.|Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
Jack, look at this.|I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.|There's a third guy?
No problem! Next week: stealing...|Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?
Incentive For Men?|Really?
I know, yeah!|And first, I have to see the MET!
You like me?|Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Well you proved them wrong.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.|Let her off the plane!
You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..|Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! . Did you hear that?
She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.|Linen closet.
I can't... I can't hear it again.|And I'm fine never having heard it...  Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?

Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?|Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?
You don't know that.|Somebody is gonna pick us.
I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.|Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
Can I adopt you?|You were?
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.|Oh, try and stop me!
Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. . Tails! Monica, she's yours!|No, that landed in your food!
Give me the bag.|No, hit me
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|What's up Joe?
You can't move at all?|Oh, well, I can move...
No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.|Monica is Ross' sister.
Yeah...|I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.|And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?|JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.|Me too.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
The chocolates aren't here yet.|Damnit!
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.|Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.
|Oh my God. Was Mike with him?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Why-why aren't you more excited?
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...|Why?
Totally.|I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.|Well, first of all, they're not called "sneakers" anymore. Apparently, they're called "kicks" or "skids" and I think I heard somebody say "slorps".  Would you help me try to sell these?
Oooh.� Let's do.� Let's send them mashed potatoes.|No!� Wait!� No, no.� Don't do that!� That's going to make them think they can come over here.
Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!|Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
Yes, you’ll be all grown up by then. We’ll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.|That’s true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!
Okay.|Bye.
You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..|Actually, I don’t think we have to.
Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!|Yeah I know.
We're just making conversation.|Ravioli's delicious!
That's great! You changed you name?|Yes I did! Meet: Princess Consuela Banana Hammock!
All right, Chandler get the coats. Erica let's go. Phoebe and Joey, keep packing! Oh my God we're gonna have a baby. All right. We're gonna have a baby! OH MY GOD, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY! Oh God, oh God, I got to sit down, I got to sit down. Ooh!|You can do this. Just breathe.
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|You have to get out of here. You slept with
Is Monica not here?|No.
You can't move. You just... you just can't.|Yeah, you don't wanna live in Westchester. That's like the worst of the Chesters.
Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?|Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.
YOU’RE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND  IT’S OUR ANNIVERSARY!|Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|What? What happened?
Look, I'm, I'm married!|So? I'm married.
Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?|Cool!
Oh! How's it going?|It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
Oh stupid metric system!|Oh my. We’re gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.|Where is she?
Wow you guys got a hospital?  Fancy!|Alright thanks, oh Ross could you stop by the coffee house and get me a muffin?
What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like|Actually about an hour and a half.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Everyday use.
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|NO!!
Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...|You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?
"Dude, Where's My Car?"|What?
I think you know.|I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|There's a forest right outside.
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.  Yes?|If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?
Hey, hey!|Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|No.
You really think so?|Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Wha. . . hey!|Better!
To use the bathroom.|You can't leave me alone with her.
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|Oh, ok. I'm just always afraid that people think I'm just fat with big breasts.
Why don't you use your Thesaurus?|What did I just say?
I can't do that!|Oh give me , , ,� � Hi, Mike?� Hi.� Listen.� I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?� If you do this I . . . Phoebe will . . . do anything you want.� Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
Congratulatioooons!|Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
Rachel, this is yours.|You'll see.
Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!|Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!
Then what did happen?|Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.
I've nothing to say to you.|You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!|No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Wow, you catch on quick.|You sprayed my front twice!
Good! Now I need you to be careful and efficient. And remember, if I am harsh with you, it is only because you are doing it wrong.|Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are.
Hi!|There she is!
Mississippi? I said count to five'!|Mississippilesly?  Well, how bad is it?
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off!  Oh my God! I can't play!
Yeah, and I wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.|Hotel? Why isn't she staying with you guys?
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know any Spanish words.
Oh man.|Of course I will call you. I love you.
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...|Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?
What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.|Phoebe, we lost half of them.
Where did you go to do it?|YOU NEVER DID IT!
Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.|All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!|Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
And you told Phoebe you were engaged.|I’m sorry, what?
Hands.|Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He’s a patient of mine, I’ve been treating him for years!
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|No-ohoh.
Right, totally.|Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.
I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.|Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what…|Let's get past the moment.
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|Mandy.
Hey!|Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|I'll take "You crossed the line".
Age?|Can’t you figure that out based on my date of birth?
I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?|Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.
Nice, put it with the others.|And I also got... two more apples.
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.|Yes, he is. Me.
Okay.  Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.|So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
this is my wife, Nancy.|Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.|I have to talk to you!!
That’s it. That’s it.|Yeah it was.
Thank you.  I think I just had a tiny orgasm.|I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
See ya!|Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.
I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.|"The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well?  What's up?
No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.|Ok, maybe you're right.
I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.|Uh huh.
Not gonna find any clothes in there!|Hey, you guys!
Is this cool, huh?|It really is.
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.
Oh God.|... she's being unreasonable!
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Okay, I�ll have the fixed salad and the duck.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|I'm so sorry Pheebs.
Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!|Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!|Great!
Really?|Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.|He had to board.
this is my wife, Nancy.|I knew that was him!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh I was just thinking. You know what would be incredible? If you guys died.
So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me.|Rach!
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|But if you wanna get married why didn't you say something before?
Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!|Wow!
Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?|Ah, did I leave the stove on?
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!|Please, you're going down!
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|What?
I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?|Oh, because his penis was too big.  They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|We think if you saw it, you'd understand. I mean you guys were there.  It is beautiful, isn't it?
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?|Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?
Oh.|Hey!� How come the door's locked?
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.|Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer.
ok|
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Is this Emmett? <pointing to EMMA>
Promise?|I promise.
Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. There's no way we're gonna make it in time.|She's got her cell, you could call her.
You still don't know my name, do you?|
see ordinarily I would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken did I sleep with her? Did I not sleep with her?|you know maybe this is a wake up call, about your whole dating attitude. Your in your thirty's and you've never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship, here you go from woman to woman, meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it doesn't tern into anything serious.
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|So, I�m, I�m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?
I lent them to Ross.|Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say "No", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.|Man, that's some bad advice!
You might want to keep practicing.|COME . . .� HOME.
Oh my God.� I can't believe you live in that building.� My grandmother lives in that building.� Ida Green?� No sense of personal space?� Kind of smells like chicken?� Looks like a potato.|"Spuds" is your grandmother?
I understand...|Aaah... you're not good at this...
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|OOOOOHHHHH!
Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?|Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Hello? Rachel?
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words .
We’re seriously asking for our money back?|The donation we made earlier, we k…, we w…, we want it back.
Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.|But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
My fajitas!!|Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
Well, it is, all right? When we were out there today, all I kept thinking was: I can't believe Chandler is screwing this woman, but MAN this would be a nice place to live!|Yeah, but so is this.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Ok, use it in a sentence.
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Cool!
Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.|The doctor will be right with you sir.
Jack, look at this.|Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
I know.|Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house.
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!|Well, it was an accident...You know, it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips!
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.|Gary Halvorson
Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.|Why are they doing this?
Who is it?|Okay, you got it.
Shake it!|Shake it!
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|That's because I'm pregnant!
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|I'm a cool, fun aunt!
What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?|You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldn’t say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!|Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!
Ok!|That's why!
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Oh no, no. I can't choose between you two! I love you both so much!
well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?|Well, what is going on with you two?
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|That's okay, we understand.
Hey bear, I need some career advice.|Tracy Reilly
I'm so sorry...|No, come on, I'm totally ok.  I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.
Barbados!|I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.
Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.|Is he gonna introduce us?
My dear, sweet Rach.|Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
Of course, I'd be honored!|Wow! Don't you look nice?!
Hi.|Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.
How come?|Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Oh whose side are you on? <back to Amy> I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.
Yeah, it takes two incomes.|Hey, is Chandler here? We talked about catching a movie.
Oh, my first love!|What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?
Yeah!|Come on Ben.
Oh, that's great.|Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.
Here we go!|Oh! Oh! She’s upside down but she’s coming! She’s coming!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Listen, um about the hair straightener, honey.. I really need one. I'm going to have dinner at my boyfriend's house.
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Hey, I forgot my scarf.
Thank you.|Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red.|You need to learn some new slang.
And that would have made the official party line.  Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.|Yeah, I know.
You won awards?|I'm not! I'm making it easier! Pick me!
Oh my God!|Phoebe, I...
this is my wife, Nancy.|I guess. There was hum...  else.
Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.|Next time, can I say breathe?
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|That's not a thing!
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
I'm still looking through mine...|Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow .
|No... It's lovely. The lights and the snow. I could look at them forever.
Hi!|Hey!
Hi.|Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  Well, why are you laughing?
I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?|I read a lot.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|"... Sarah. I dig you", Uh? "Doctor Ross Geller".
Hi|Hey! Hi!
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Is that what you say to Chandler?
Oh... Okay, sorry!|Get there faster!
No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.|Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
… everybody we know? Yeah.|Great. Thanks!
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet’s still available?|I’m so tired.  Yeah okay, but no foreplay.
I understand...|No, I'll do it.
What, the blonde with no bra?|She was blonde?  Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.
Actually, he is buying a much bigger place. It's got a great view of Central Pa.....|mmm That's enough about you!
Well, I hope, you got some room left.|Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear �
NO!|Yes?
Nighty-night!|They left.
Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.|Ben Weiss
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.|That bad?
Hey!|You were incredible!
Were you there?|No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...
So, you just let her go?|Yeah?
Are you kidding? I’m like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.|And you really think this is a good idea?
Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.|Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are.
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|I love you too...
Wher-where have you been?|You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy.  Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn�t it? How d�you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.
Why didn�t I get that message?|What?
Sure.|Really? Which one?
No it is awesome!|Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.|You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?|I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?
All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.|
I know, yeah.|I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
Aaah.�|So, ah . . . So, how was it?�� Uh, did you guys. . . Did you guys have a good time?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said "Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's" and he said.. <pause> He said.. "Joey you stink at lying." What am I going to do?
Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress.  Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!|Oh, then pass.
No problem! Next week: stealing...|Uhm...  Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...
I know.� �� So, what's going on with you and Ross?|Well, um . . . I don't know.� I mean, for a long time nothing.� But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.
No, I arranged that...|
And they love me!|Oh my God!
Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.|Steven Rosenhaus
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|Yeah?
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.|Ok, here we go!
I can't imagine what he sees in her.|By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? Tom and Sue's daughter Jen.
Do you have to go?|We were gonna go see the Jets!
What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like|I told you it wasn�t long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
Why am I hearing cheering?|Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
Uh!|Ok  Alright! Lets do it!
Well, I don't care, so you pick!|Did you just hung up on me?  All right, look, I need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.
You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the|But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?|Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
Hey, hey!|You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?
MIKE!!!|Yeah?
Hey!|I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!|I did?
Hey, here you go.|Maybe.
Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?|
this is my wife, Nancy.|Yes, please!  So, what's going on?
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.
Oh my God! Let me see.|Who's that dirty old lady?
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!|But I want to.
Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.|B - O - S ...
Really, you want to wait a year?|It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer."  It'll probably be more than a year.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Correct. Her actual favorite movie is...
So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable?  Yeah, sounds about right.|Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.
Ooh, this is it!  Oh, that’s him! That’s him!|Great! Go get him.
Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?|I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
Incentive For Men?|Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.
After you, miss Banana Hammock.|Oh hi Rita! Good!  Oh, Rita's a massage client.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|"And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.|Plus hotels are fun! My room has this little fridge full of free snacks!
Hey!|Yeah, let's go.  Thanks Ross.
Here we go!|Oh God!
Hey!|Okay, try it.
Okay.|No... It's all glued together.
I understand...|You have... have a girlfriend?
Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I’m looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he’s like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.|I think I know who you’re talking about.
Oh... Yes, I'm sure. Oh honey, let's go. Okay bye everyone.|Chandler, wait, wait, wait...
Bedsprings, unmistakable!|You do realise that's your brother?
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Uh.. To name a few.  You know.. You know.. You've just always been like this. You just have to have everything. And I couldn't have anything. Like in junior high, when you stole Timmy from me. I mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?
Ok, Ross, what�s going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?|I don�t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
I... I'm Phoebe.|Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...|Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
Ok.|Do you smell beets?
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|Yeah, didn�t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven�t being going out for too long, but rather there is this
Then what did happen?|No, I didn’t!
Yeah, where were you!|And I won!
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!|Honey.
But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes�no big deal.|Oh, blablablabaybaybay.
Guess we'll never know how it ends.|Good. You?
Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.|Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.|Check it out!
Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.|I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...
Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.|When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
Previously on Friends...|The job is in Paris.
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|May I have a word with you, please?
It's a science.|Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on "Days". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.
Oh my God! How long has she been crying?|Well alright, looks like you guys have got it under control so I’m just gonna go.
Hey honey! I missed you today!|Oh, yeah?
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Well, at least we got these little guys out.
Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.|Well, what would we be doing?
Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.|E-e-excuse me?
... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...|Erectus?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>
Really? Like you have a routine?|No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.
Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.|Tip of the iceberg.
Serve the ball, chump!|: Serve the ball, chump.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|And last but not least.
No, come on, you know that's not true.|What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Thank you Amy.
I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.|Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"|Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.
That was going to be my next argument.|Hey!
I love you!|I love you too!
Don't judge me, I'm only human!|Did you take that tape?
No, no, no!|Probably.
So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing.� Fascinating isn't it.|Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|She spit up. Judy! She spi�Judy! Look alive, Judy!  Thank you.
Hey!|Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?|Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
Thanks.|It feels like we’re cheating on our house. And if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won’t do?
Yeah?|Yeah.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Oh, wow, Molly is just great!
Because it is too damn hard Ross. I can't even begin to explain to you how much I'm gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go... Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong. It's because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there's your goodbye... Oh!|Rach!
That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?|Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
Bye, see ya.|Yeah.
That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.|But please, let's just forget the whole thing.
You said that was sexy!|�kay, look: Can we just drop this? I�m not gonna smoke again.
Hey.|Hey.
Well, that’s what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!|Phoebe, that’s huge!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Are they right?
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
: yeah he has to stay in Tulsa this weekend|how come?
Oh... okay.|Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!|So how've you been?
Miss?|No, you don't.
That was a test and you just failed.|I have sex with dinosaurs??
And so engaged.|What?  Oh my God! She-she thinks we’re engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we’re engaged?!
Ooh, that was fast.|Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
What?!|What?!
Okay.|The rest of the scene.
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?
Congratulations! I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey ‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.|What, that we had a baby? Come on let’s give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o� clock. So I was hoping you and I could have a
Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?|Huh.
"Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in this|I gotta stop this.
Oh... then I overpaid.|Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
What do you mean?|Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.|Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
Emma's down for the night.|Oh, good.
Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .|Excuse us!
nothing, I'm excited about our date, Mike this is Ross Geller this is Mike Haaaaa|Hey, so are you sure your ready to go.
Gotcha.|Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!|Hey!
Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.|Well, not at all...
Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?|That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
No-ot for me it doesn’t.|Do you have any question for Erica?
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|No, thank you.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch "Access Hollywood".
Great novels?|Fine ... mediocre porn
Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?|O K.
Oh man!|There's an indoor pool, you can swim there!
I'm still all those things!|You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!
You're from Yonkers! Your last name is Buffo-Martisis!|Hello? Is someone on the line?
Name?  I know Ross but what’s it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.|Just Ross!
You still don't know my name, do you?|What? You don't want me to get a job?
You said you’d marry Joey?|Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married!  I’m not helping.
To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.|Oh, I know how you feel...
I know.|Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?
Yay.|I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left Philange.
pelle|pel.
Yeah that’s true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.|Look, we’ve been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby.  Oh that’s…now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we’re doing really, we’re doing really well right now.
What? What?|Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the same way, but I do. And, and when I'm in a café, having coffee, or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I'll think of you. Aw.
Ok if everyone’s on board, it’s settled, Chandler,  Chandler?|Yep.
I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.|Brian Buckner and Sebastian Jones
A teacher?|Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
Isn’t she beautiful?|Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Uh Joey...
Whoo-hoo!|Joey, where are those bags?
No, no. No.|But... ergo...
...If-you-say-so.|How old is your phonebook?
I'll get it.� � It's for you.|I don't understand what just happened here.
Incentive For Men?|Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|You put this in your coffee.
Oh man.|I love you too.
You know the book says that whenever she’s sleeping I should be sleeping so…|We’re moving to Tulsa
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh we just put her down for a nap.
Ah! The high road...|You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!|Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!
I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.|Well, I just lost my erection.
I am Mike.|Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
But you didn’t give it to her?|No!
Joey's bare ass!|Ok. Monica?
Why?|Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.
Phoebe did the signs!|He’s downstairs getting the rest of the stuff out of the cab.
Hey!|I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
I don’t think so.|Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.
Yeah...|I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|No, Mike's here.
So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.|So where did you study?
I guess not.|I can't believe you thought I was cheating.�  You own me an apology.
I can’t believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?|That’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
Arghhh! Double standards!|You kissed him?
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Hey, hey!!
Really?|Robert Carlock and Wendy Knoller
I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff .  Who the hell are you!?|Who the hell are you?
Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!|Oh, that's right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|Where do you think Mike really is?
Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!|Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.
Oh uh, up or down?|Oh down please.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I�m never leaving her again.|I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: �Mommy, I�m a girl, take me with you.�
Oh, why? What's up?|Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
Your age?|You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's….  You did you come up with that?
What about your massage client?|Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
Sure I do.  Coule?|No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.|Look at you all grown up.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Okay. Shhh...
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!|Hey!
I'm dead?|And so young.
Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.|Got stood up, huh?
No problem! Next week: stealing...|Bye plates!
Really? So this is... this is my big send off in the married life? Rachel this is the only bachelorette party I'm ever gonna have! I've got a big wad of ones in my purse! Really? I mean, really? It's just tea?|Nooo! Phoebe, of course there is more! I mean, I'll just go and talk to Monica and get an ETA on the pee-pee's!
Strike two!|You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?
Okay, how long was I watching that woman?|I’m just saying that y’know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and…he’s gonna have his own life. Right?
Hey Mike sorry to just drop by like this, can I come in?|Sure  who are you?
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Deal!
You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!|Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
Should we send something?|That's great!
Great game, huh?|Uhuh, uhuh...
I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.|You are not going to regret this.
Yay!|Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
No, no, no!|But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
No, I arranged that...|Ok... I mean...
Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.|Mmmm! Mmm!
|Kevin Bright
She has a lot of crap!|Seriously?
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!|Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
Isn’t she beautiful?|
Oh, DAMN IT!|Ok, given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy, or insemination using a sperm donor.
It's really gone?|Well, what do you do?
Sure.|Ohh! Fish, seaweed, a sunken ship.
I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.|Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.|Rach, she's not going to remember this.
What?|Okay.
Here you are|I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.|I'm so lucky I married you.
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.|Where's Ross?
What?|It's what you want. You should go.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|A match, a candle...
Yay!|So, so is she still going to Paris?
That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!|Really?
Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, you’re gonna get together right?|I don’t think that we are.
Oh, I like my job.|No!
Ohh.|Okay, one thing at a time.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.|You guys have such a great place here.
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.|Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
Arghhh! Double standards!|Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
And you’re Okay with that?|Yes. I mean, it’s what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  That’s why they call them plans.  Hello?  I’m fine.
Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.|Phoebe, where's your purse?
I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?|How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
Incentive For Men?|Oh, I'll take some of that.
Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.|Little people?
I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.|Why did you go along with that?
Unbelievable. She says goodbye to everyone but me.|Well, maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be, you know, implicit.
Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum...  There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.|Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.|Who ?
Hey guys!|Hey!
Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.|What are you gonna do?
|It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.|Just ah… just put roommate.
Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?|Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.|Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
I gave you my number, you never called me.|No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
Hey, where's Rachel?|She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
Bye...|RACHEL!
I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.|Hey.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.
What's that?|It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.
This is harder than I thought it would be.|Oh, it's gonna be okay.
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.|Fine, I'll give the suit back.
Ok honey. that was close.|: Hey Rach its me ok I just got the Chandler's room and I caught him molesting himself.
Ok honey. that was close.|Oh that couldn't have been pretty. but you know guys do that.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|"I'd like to go for a walk", uhm "scratch my belly".
What?|This doesn't feel weird!
Hey.|Hey. So, what did he say?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|A guy who won two.
D�you want to?|Yeah, let�s celebrate life!
Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!|You don't like him.
I lent them to Ross.|Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?|I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.
Hey you guys.|Oh! Any word on casting yet?
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Hey.
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity?  Damnit!
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Adoption.
Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.|Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!|Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!
well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?|Oh yeah, that�s what she says. But maybe you�re not ovulating at all, maybe it�s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.
Oh, no, no. That is a doll.|Oh, thank God, 'cause that thing's really creepy!
It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".|I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?
That's terrible!|Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic.  Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.|Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
Celebrity.|Chandler?
You won awards?|I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump!  Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.|Did you get it?
Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.|Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.|Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
We need to talk to you about something.|Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.|No, she was just much better at job than me!
Heh.|Oh, man!
Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée and it was just sooo beautiful.|Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Who in God's name are you?
Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection.  Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.|Honey?
I know, it�s the first time, we�re leaving the baby and � hey, I know how hard it is for you, but � but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. She�s great with kids.|She is?
Yay.|Well...
Oh, look at her, so happy!|If only there were a smaller one to clean this one!
It’s pretty, Okay date of birth?|You know my birthday.
Who is it?|Oh,  Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..|Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.|I don't believe this, hold on a second. You guys die and I don't get your baby?
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|Ok!  Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Oh, What's the matter?
Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?|My name is Precious.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?|How do you think I got him in the first place?
Oh, good for you.|She's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and... well, it's actually because of you, really, that we're together, I mean, I saw what you had with that Mike guy, and I just said "Boy, I want that".
Nana liked it rough!|Hi!
Yes.|Then, I might as well � . Not really sure what to do now.
Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.|He’s not really my type.
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|These are for Erica!
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just � she loves it when I'm dramatic.
Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.|Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|I can't believe Emma is already one!
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|Can any of you watch Emma?
: how do you know I have one of those?|that would've been better, I'll try that Hi I'm Joey.
Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.|Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.|Ooy.
Especially Ross!|
Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.|He's a brilliant diagnostician!
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.  "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
And they love me!|Yes, she gives the people what they want.
You know, the strippers, and the guys dancing, and you know, pee-pee's flying about.|Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!|Oh my God.
Hands.|He’s in room 816.
Me too.  You know what? I just realised something. I don't wanna go home.|Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.
Oh, what were the other two?|Well, let�s see. The first one is: I don�t want to. And, you know, I�m not going.
You never cooked since 1996.|Is the window open? Because if there�s a window open, a bird could fly in there.
Who cares, it got you here.|Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.|I'm really sorry you guys.
Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.|Yeah, you do that, and I go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding.
Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.|It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
Hey!|Where's your passport?
Oh, wow, can you believe you're like three weeks away?|I know.
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?|Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino’s.
Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.|You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.|And you... Your home is lovely.
From the guy in the bar, why didn�t I get that message?|Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
Do you have to go?|I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.
Incentive For Men?|Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.|Holy crap!
Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!|Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one.  Mandy.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.|Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.|Let's ditch him!
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|No, no, no.
She has a lot of crap!|Oh, I can give you that.
How was everything, sir?|Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.
Can I adopt you?|Huh?
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
I'll let you get acquainted.|That's what our friends call us.
m'ap|mah
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Yeah.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!|Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
Wha . . .?� Go back?� To the "land where time stands still"?|I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.� So, you have to intercept all his calls.
Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?|Great!  This baby'd better to be really good.
Previously on Friends...|Or facing a bitch of a commute.
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?
Okay.|Okay, let's try this one more time.
Y’know what? I don’t like you without mom.|Hello sir, you know Monica.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?
Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!|But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
Uhuh.|Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!|CUT!
Wow, really?|Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
Where you going, Joe?|For a walk.
Good!|Ah well, I-I'm seeing someone.
Whenever you're ready Joey.|Dude, come on! French it u-up!
Alright-y then.|Then why you work here?
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Yeah...
Your age?|Oh, thank you, sir… or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me
Other wall, people! Other wall!|That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
Nighty-night!|No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
Previously on Friends...|Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
Previously on Friends...|Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
Ah I had a little thing with Joey, if you think this is bad you should see him.|Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit.  You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?
Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.|Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
Hey, Rach!|This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
Alright-y then.|Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around?  Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
|Yeah!
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Oh, oh, oh...
Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. . Can’t believe it's been a whole year!|I know. This has been the best year...  THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!
Yeah?�|I don't know what to say.� We shouldn't have lied to you.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Yeah.
Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.|Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
All right.� All right.� Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?� � Bwa-ah-ah!|What is he doing?
Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you, don't I?|Hey Rach!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Damnit! anybody got anything?
Ross?|I never gave it to you.
But then how do we know who wins?|Nobody wins!
Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...|Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Okay...
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.|Hey.
Ah, so glad you decided to come.|What?
Incentive For Men?|Yeah.
Congratulatioooons!|It's a day to be thankful.
Wow!|Wow!
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Hello?
Yeah?|Can you come here with me for a minute?
Sssshhhh!|Rachel?
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?|I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.|Bye!
But you were going to propose?|No!!
No, I don't think so.|Mine was a humdinger
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|I won, hey!
Of course, I'd be honored!|Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."
Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?|Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
Uh, Joe?|Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now. Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
Hey, Zack!|Hey Chandler.
Ok honey. that was close.|: Yes! Chandler Watches Shark Porn!
I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.|So, did you know Ross well?
Whoa, whoa.� Wait a minute.� Wait a minute.� If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?|I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
You took the same class twice.|It was hard!
Oh for the love of God!|It’s coming! It’s coming!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
Oh-oh, wait, my mother is gonna be here any minute. And she has the keys.|Alright, I can�t, I can�t wait that long. You have to do something�knock that door down!
Oh, water would be fine.|Oh, because we love kids. Love ‘em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?|It doesn’t make any sense.
We're just making conversation.|Ok. I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny...
Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?|You hand-wrote it?
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Ok fine. I'll handle this.  Phoebe?
Wher-where have you been?|You mean the lully story?
�s a good toast.|Could you please get her attention?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Aren't you...?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that!
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Are you okay Mon?
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|I need to talk to you.
Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?|Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!
Enjoy!|Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|Is it ok if I hug you now?
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Um... hi.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Oh, man! I can't believe she's actually leaving. How am I gonna say goodbye to Rachel?
Nana liked it rough!|How was your night?
well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?|Uch, you see, I�m ovulating.
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|"What?"
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|Thank you!
You might want to keep practicing.|All right look.� � If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna.
Oh God! Is that veal?|Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?
Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?|You could do that?
Really? What happened?|Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!|Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!|Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
How do you fix the chair?|Except that!  Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
I�m serious. C�mon, you should go. Here.  No, uh-uh, just go.|What � Oh!
Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh!  Have you ever done that?|No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
Wow! This place is beautiful!|No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called "The Days of Our Lives".
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|Phoebe, will you marry me?
Could you press up too please?|Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
Sure.|I think it's sweet.
You are an amazing wife.  No really you're amazing you were actually gonna do this for me, I mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that.|: Im very, very drunk right now.
Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get…|Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it!  You can relax now. Yeah.
Really? What's that like?|Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
What do you really want to do?|Thank you.
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|I know.� You're right.� I want to see you too.� I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?� He's really looking forward to this.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
What do you really want to do?|Now give me my real gift.
Nighty-night!|Joey! It's Estelle!
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?
Yeah!|Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
"You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for – Bang – End Scene!"|Absolutely amazing!  The part is yours.
Oh man.|you. This is just something I have to do.
I don’t think the next patient is very far along.|Okay, well then bring her in.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Exactly!
Hey!|Bring it.
Humiliating and noble!|Ross, you did not come up with "got milk?"
Oh ok.|Err... Kind of.
Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I�m never leaving her again.|Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.
Well, it matters to me.|Why?
What! When?|I dunno!
Hell, yeah!|Did you know this about him?
Ok, we're still on that.|Well...it's not about quality.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?
No, I arranged that...|What party?
Alright, we�ll just, uh, see when you get here. Bye.  Huh, that was my mom, she�s stuck in terrible traffic.|Okay, well that�s now the third sign that I should not leave Emma.
She was nice!|Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!
Ok.|Here we go!
We’re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I’m glad you’re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this . I don’t know if you wanna use it, but…|Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won’t be needing a veil, I actually won’t be wearing a dress at all!
There. Here's their card.|Hey Pheebs!
Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?|Yeah.  Don't do the dance.
Emma's awake.|Yeah?
That’s it. That’s it.|Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
Why do you keep looking at the screen?|I'm not. I'm praying.  Where... where are you going?
No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.|No, Ross' sister was really fat.
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.|HEY! I never have an off night ok although sometimes when I'm a little bloated I don't feel very sexy BUT EVEN THEN I'M BETTER THEN MOST!
Yeah... Yeah, that's true.|Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Two seconds...
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Are you a paleontologist?
Sure.|They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.
You told us both we could be in the wedding?|Well, in my defense, you were not supposed to tell each other.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
Arghhh! Double standards!|So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because �
|He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?|No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.|Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.|Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
Phoebe did the signs!|Yeah, I’m not so sure you should be here when he comes up.
Best out of three?|That's what I'm thinking.
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|I know why I don't remember her, huh?
Oh, she’s so beautiful.|What?
How do you fix the chair?|Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping.
You won awards?|What d'you want?
Me! I'm up for puppets!|Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Stupid Jane Rogers!!
It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!|Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
I have a weird feeling about this place.  How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.|Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
So far so good!|Honey, I'm old!
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|No, NO!  Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
Ok!|When did you stop sucking?
I know.|I love this.
We gotta get them out of there!|How?
A MONTH??|What the... DIAL IT DOWN!  Ok, dial it up a little!
So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?|Oh, it's perfect.
I really, really am sorry.|How could you know. Why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?
I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.|You can come to my house!
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?
Isn’t she beautiful?|Oh, I like that. Yeah…
Uh-huh.|What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog!  Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
Miss?|I really thought she'd stay.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?
How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?|No, I sat in the paint.
Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.|Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
How do you fix the chair?|What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
Who is it?|Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.|What else?
It's open.|Hey!
Hey!|Oh, that smells good!
And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.|He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
Son of a gun, it is!|Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest. I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat?  Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?|What?
|I'm not scared.  HE CAN SENSE MY FEAR. MY THROAT IS EXPOSED.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
What?|So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
That’s your new job, day and night, she starts crying I need you here.|Oh no no no no!
I'm still looking through mine...|Just double checking  No!
oh umm Mike's picking me up for a date.|oh yea now um how is that going, is it getting serious?
All right, me too.  Should we wake her up?|No! No, come on let her sleep! She’s so exhausted.
And that's not all I'm allergic to.|Oh, it's not over!
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!|But I insist!
That's alright. Listen, listen.|Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.
Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.|David is going to propose to Phoebe.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?|You're gonna do it?
Hello.|Hey.
Oh, happy my wedding day to you!|Ok-dokey, Joey, listen. This is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right? We're gonna have hair and make-up going on in the bathroom and oh, I had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?
Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!|What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.
Hi! I’m Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.|Really? I’ve been dealing with Dr. Wells.
Oh my God, that's Charlie!|She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...|He said "erectus"!
Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?|No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!|I FEEL THE SAME WAY!
Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...|No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
Thanks!|What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
Hey, hey!|So?
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Isn't that amazing?
I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...|Oh, damn you Geller!
Previously on Friends...|How did the job stuff go?
So how is this for our big double date tonight?|Oh my God!
Does that mean we have to bust it open?|I don't know. Maybe.
That was me.|Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.
|Thanks!
Yeah...|We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
Och, god.  Oh, thank god, you�re okay. I�m so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.|Great. So let�s get going?
Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.|Oh my god.
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
Hey, where have you been?|Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
...If-you-say-so.|Oh, God!
Okay.|Bye.
no it's not ringing any bells.|my god woman! How many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this?
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Do you want to know why you don't want  me to have the baby?
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.|What are you doing?
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk?  "Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..." Spit it out, David!
Why? What was it?|That I was going to eat him.
Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.|You're welcome, sweetheart.
Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!|Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!
Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!|Oh my God!
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|Ok, Rach!
Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.|Seriously. Wanna make one of those?
Yeah, where were you!|Yes!  Y-E-S. Yes!
Then don't go!|Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.
Good weird?|She’s perfect.
See? Intuitive!|What? Where did you hear that?
Nighty-night!|
Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.|Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!
God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!|Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
Yes.|Well uh if you must know I’m a widower.
Celebrity.|What...? NO!
It's just a little bit more, honey.|Is it really that bad?
Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.|And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.
Gotcha.|Oh really!
Hey, if you need a tour guide...|Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?|How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. . I just heard it as you must have heard it and that’s not good. Let me start again. I’m a paleontologist, you’ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones… fossils!
What about your massage client?|Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.|I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
What?|Because she's just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
Why? What's the big deal?|Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
She's mine!|She's mine!
Uh-huh.|I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
Okay.|Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?
I am sooo drunk.|For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|I would love your autograph.
Everyone gets a goodbye but me? What have I got to do to get a goodbye, huh? Be best friends with you? Uh, go out with you? Have a baby with you? Oh wait a minute, wait a minute, I did all those things.|Ross...
That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.|But pleasure is important,  and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?
Hey, listen to me, listen to me…you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that’s not gonna happen.|Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!|And I can't stop you.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|What are you going to do?
Oh... my...|Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
I got off the plane.|You got off the plane.
Bye, see ya.|I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
Gotcha.|You really liked it?
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there!  I’ll guard the door!
14?|No, 19.
Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!|Well, you are not doing a very good job!
Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.|Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"
Okay.|Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!
What the hell am I supposed to do!|All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
Yeah.|Oh my God, we did it!
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better!
Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.|Woah. Woah... <nearly really drops the plate and more seriously> Woah.
Yay!|And if it’s a girl?
You're married more than once?|No.
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|What?
Thanks for coming.|Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Yeah.|Ok. See you, bye.
Nighty-night!|Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|They are delicious
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|Me too. Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again. I love you all so much.
What?|Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.
Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don’t think you’ve met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist’s office. Thank God for adult acne huh?|What’d he say?
Wow! You look like... like my mom.|I'm wearing pantyhose!
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
Nighty-night!|You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.|Ok, ok, I'll throw away the traps.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?
Ohhh.|So, do you know what you’re gonna call her yet?
No Mon, you want to put them in concentric circles. I want to do this.|It smells really bad in here.
No!|A little bit more.
You wouldn’t let her have a grape?|Oh no! Not me! Emma!
Oh my God, that's Charlie!|Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
Incentive For Men?|Who else?
Oh, I like my job.|Did I not mention that?
uh huh|do you have a compact in your purse?
Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?|No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
You know what I just realized? We have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.|What's up?
Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.|Look, doctor!
Other wall, people! Other wall!|No idea what it means.
Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice.|More foosball?
"Gimme your money, punk!"|Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you… you mugged me?
|FYI..
Eva Trorro... womba...|Kate Miller?
Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..|I will explain it to her.
Ross...|I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?|Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
I’m telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they’re gonna be there until they start their real family.|Well I—That’s never gonna happen with Ross.
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Hey you guys!
You won awards?|Mm-mh. I printed them out on my computer.
Hey!|Happy wedding day!
Okay, my turn. My turn.  I won’t.|Oh nothing I… Sorry, I just can’t stop crying.
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in|Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.
You might wanna get back in there.|Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello?  The same thing happened again!
Who is it?|That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
Okay.  Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.|But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
Insane.|I know.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy.  I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.
Is something wrong?|No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea...  Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.
Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. .|That's fire. Beats everything.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much. I love you. Good night.
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.|I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.
Yay!|But you already gave all your money to charity!
What have you got there?|Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.|You'd do that for us?
I'm dead and no one cares?|Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.|Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?|So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?
� Oh yeah.� I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.|There's nobody here Joe.
No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!|Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
You know that’s… that’s her.|Oh god look at her sleeping.  Oh, I love her so much!  Oh, I think I’m gonna wake her up.
What? They will be!|No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there’s other stuff. Here’s a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.|Ah ah...
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?|Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.
I don't even know what that's for.|Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
Well, the club lost it's power.|What?
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.|And Joey?
Barbados!|Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
Yeah.� What do you think?|Well, it looks great.� It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.� So . . .
I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.|No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.|Oh, right.
It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.|That's great!
You really think this man is speaking French?|Sa-sa-saw!
That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.|Clifford Burnett.
I would, but you're the last one.|Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?
Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...|Is this your first appology?
Incentive For Men?|Oh my God!
No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.|Come on! Joe!
Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!|Okay mister! Fertilize me!
He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.|Did I go to this school?
I am not doing this over the phone.|Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?
Hey, hey!|Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Don't come any closer!
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.|Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
She’s just so cute! I just wanna bite her ear off and use it and a sucking candy.|The diapers?
Yes, please!|Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?|What?
THAT'S NOT ME!|What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
What a small world!|You two know each other?
Hey!|Hey!
I can't imagine what he sees in her.|Hey, what's going on?
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery. I’ll take you now. If you want, but  I really want to talk to you.
What happened?|Who cares, AND?
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Joey, hang on for a second. Lennart, can we talk to you for a moment?
I'm gonna get the lasagna.|Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
The comedian? USO?!|Uhm, it's USA, sir.
I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.|I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...|Ok, good!  I think I broke your bowl.
Oh! What are we gonna do?|Just be honest with her.
Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?|No. I was just going to do this myself.
Yeah.|So you took off my pants and shoes?
Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?|I had a great time.
Sure.|Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|"I think you know!"
Two thousand dollars?|Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?
Sure, what do you have in mind?|I think you know.
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|What?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.
Rachel used to live in that room.|Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
Really?|Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|Cafeteria.
I'm so sorry...|Oh, I really could.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Okay!
That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!|Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Guess where they are?
Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?|All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...
Oh God!|No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift, I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!|Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|She really left.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|By the way, that fight was totally arousing.
Oh! Why don't you introduce me?|Yeah.
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.|Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
You guys ready to go?|Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.|Hey.
Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start.|Ok well, before you do, I know we weren't supposed to get you going away presents,  but I do have something for you.
Hey, Phoebs|Hey.
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...
I lent them to Ross.|My cranberries!
Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.|I don't have a *job*!
You, you want me to help you with that?|Why, does it look like I’m having trouble with my misshapen claw?
Who is this?|This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "yes" but I know she really wants to be with you!
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|I'm not interested.
Well, this is very generous!|Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, y�you know, everything is gonna be fine. The baby�s sleeping.|What if she jumped out the bassinet?
It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".|Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Yeah, I know the type.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|What are you, what are you doing here?
Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.|I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
Again, you're welcome.|Awww, awww, it's beautiful.
now I feel terrible this is all my fault.|well you not what you should feel terrible about, this could have been my serious guy he was sweet and smart and funny. Do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?
So you forfeit?|You can't do that!
Yeah, wow.|Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.|You're gonna be great.
Well, I guess they�re not coming. You wanna just order?|Er�does not.
so it was kind of a shock after 25 years of marriage my parents, a perfect couple getting divorced, I kinda took it the hardest cause I was the youngest.|Uh huh, sure, yeah. How can you not remember me?
Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?|Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...|What?
Yay!|It’s okay honey, you’ll find a name.
Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.|No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!|Rachel... I heard you guys whispering.
We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.|Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!
You'll be fine. Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.|Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth!
What about your massage client?|Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
Previously on Friends...|I think it is.
That sounds like fun.|Yeah!
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?|Yeah.
Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.|Then I'm happy too.
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!|Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
Oh, in my head he's done some pretty "not-gay-stuff"!|Oh, wish me luck!
Look, I just don’t want you to think that we’re animals who do it whenever we want.|What?
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.|I think we may have really done it this time.
|What?
I'll let you get acquainted.|Ok.
How are we gonna decide who gets this?|Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row? Head she wins, tails I lose.  Wait a minute...
this is my wife, Nancy.|
Oh.|and you don't have to worry about glue sniffing with me. although I do smell the occasional magic marker, yeah ah anyway I just think I can make you happy.
I'm parked in a garage on Morton!|I was?
Hey, here you go.|No, no, Rachel?
Yep!|Alright, what was this sentence originally?
You really think this man is speaking French?|Écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé.
I don’t think the next patient is very far along.|OH….MY….GAWD!!!
Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?|Ooh... Not so good.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Sarah.
It's a one-woman play called "Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life".|It sounds interesting!
Are you serious?|When we found out that we're gonna get this baby, Chandler and I started talking and we decided that we didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|But I thought if you left, you get fired.
Thats not how you see me, is it?|No you're all about the fun.
I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.|Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?
I am sorry, I don’t know, I am sorry, I don’t know why I did that!|Okay
If you want to check your email, just ask!|Actually the wet season is June to December.
Everything was delicious!|The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
Hey!|Can you ever feel your ears?
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!|oooh! Oh oh!
Both it is, thank you.|Hey, hi, hi!
Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...|Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!|Oh no!You guys aren't supposed to get divorced for 7 years!
Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?|So this is what a stroke feels like.
Oh my God!|Hey, you know what might help?
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Sure.
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Ooh! But the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from New Jersey!
Uh!|Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!
Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!|Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?
: how do you know I have one of those?|really, great, did I actually ask you?
No.|Are you kidding? Oh my God...
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|What's happenin'?
Especially Ross!|Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I’ll guess just…I’ll come back.
Yay.|But she is sometimes.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Joey!
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.|You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|. Good choice Ross.
Your age?|A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know… maybe he falls… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: "Not suitable for adults!"
Now that Rachel's gone?|So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.
You took the same class twice.|Hi.
Oh man.|Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?|And then Rachel wasn�t sure she could leave the baby.
You still don't know my name, do you?|I hate that guy.
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|All right let's just do this.
well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?|Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can�t get enough.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Oh, we have one too!!
Oh, I like my job.|It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!|Oh no, no, no, don't stop!
So you forfeit?|No, you didn't.
Dead.  Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.|Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?
All right.|You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.|Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
What?|Joey proposed to me.
Oh... then I overpaid.|Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|I have a question I need to ask you.
Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?|Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
How...how...?|I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
What about your massage client?|Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
Hi!|Hello!
Wher-where have you been?|Well, we had a little fight.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|Okay, here we go...
After you, miss Banana Hammock.|Oh hey, how are you?
Again, you're welcome.|I do have feelings for you.
I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say…|There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.
Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.|Well, actually, I think this might help.
Jack, look at this.|Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!!
Thank you guys for having us over.|Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?|Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Hi you guys.
What? Oh my God! To who?|This guy! He has a killer apartment.
So bad.|So bad.
Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...|Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.
But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?|I'm adopted?!
Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.|Hey Joey, I don’t think we can use this.
Okay.|Okay, from the top, people!
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in|Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!
Oh my god!|Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.|Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
Oh, ‘They are warm, nice, people with big hearts’.|And that became ‘they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
Hey!|Oh, well. Everything that I need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that I will be needing them.
It's because I'm scrappy.|Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.
You did? How?|Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used.
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?|Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"!  Yeah... that's a funny cup!
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Yeah... for three years.
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".|Fresh!
Previously on Friends...|I didn't say we were brothers.
Miss?|They're waiting for me, Ross. I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?|What? When was this?
No, you didn’t!|Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.
Good job.|Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?|What do you think Pheebs?
I have to go to the bathroom.|
Hey, what's-what's going on?!|Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica.
What? What?|Could you get me a muffin?
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?|Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?|Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...
Hey guys!|Hey, let me tell them!
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??
Bye.|Oh my God! I’m sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.|What is the point of having them if we never use them?
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.
Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make… uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid…|Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.
I lent them to Ross.|Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?|Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok.  Hmmmm... raunchy!|Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?|Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Really? Are you sure?
That's the perfect amount!|Y'know what's weird?
No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.|Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Someday.
Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?|Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
Do you have any ideas?|Real estate, huh? Hmmm...
...If-you-say-so.|Rachel?
You might want to keep practicing.|No! Wait!
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|It's not the same.
Hey!|Hey!
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?
Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.|What do you mean?
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.|Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... tzz-zzz, mmm.|Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?
I don't have to tell you everything!|Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
Kiss me.|Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
Kiss me.|What?
Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.|Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...
So uh... I guess I wanna take off.|Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
Jack, look at this.|And you know, I have a massage client soon.
I lent them to Ross.|I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.|I could fall asleep at a play.
Hey, you said that without gagging!|I know!
Uh!|Hey will you get me tickets too?
Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...|Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
Good!|Are you okay?
Just put it on a plate and leave.|Okay, let's find these birds.
Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?|Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.
What are you doing?|Oh, you'll see my friend.
She has a lot of crap!|Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.
I'll put a pillowcase over my head.|Hey!
Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.|Hi!
Yeah… but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.|Still… this is amazing… Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.
no it's not ringing any bells.|Hey Hayley you've really gotta fix that doorknob. Joey!
You might want to keep practicing.|I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin' on ya.� I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
�s a good toast.|W-oa � Mommy!
Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!|Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.|Okay, the thing is..
Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .|Mmm hmm.
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and  "Oh My God"!
It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.|Okay.
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?|No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!
Ok, for my next song I think I�ll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer|Oh you�ll probably take care of that on your hands.
Well do you love him?|Sure.
HEY! Mike called were going out again! YAY! YAY!|YAY!  quick thing, I went to talk to Mike.
Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.|Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
See? Intuitive!|He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it.  But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|You know, on the one hand you're happy for them, but on the other hand it's hard to let go.
Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.|You too. Last night was just wonderful.
You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.|I don't know...
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!|I don't have a choice...
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!|.
Hey|Welcome back!
Fine.|
Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.|Oh Chandler, stop talking!
Ok honey. that was close.|: yea well the weird part is... he was getting off to a shark attack show!
Yay.|Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!|Twenty-one hours, you’re a hero.
Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...|So, shall we?
Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.|Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.
Oh, that�s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?|Well, call me!
Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!|He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
Ice sculpture? That sounds really fancy! I told you I just want a simple wedding.|Please... honey, leave the details to me. Now I wanna make this day as special for you as I can. Now, ok, I was thinking that the harpist should wear white.
Hi... I'm on a date...|That's great!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Okay, what does it mean?
You should be. You’re really on top of stuff..|We don’t?
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Weekend at Bernie’s.
Hey!|Ha!
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Yeah?
Can you?|Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
I lent them to Ross.|It's really starting to hurt.
Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?|Because she is!
Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.|I understand.
All right... Oh, Emma loves him!|Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?|Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|Why don't I show you the baby's room?
Ooh...|Still nervous?
Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?|Hm-hmm!
Hey, hey!|She was a drug dealer!
Arghhh! Double standards!|Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
It's ok, it's ok. You know what?|Okay good.
No don�t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.|Oh, yeah, yeah that�s Michelle.
You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?|That�s a great story�can I eat it?
I like those odds!|Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
Wow!|So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern  "I could go right now, maaan!"
Again, you're welcome.|You do?
Honey why don’t you go lie down.|Couldn’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldn’t sleep.  Y’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now I’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now I’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldn’t fall asleep.
You can�t order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.|Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there�s still some food left on their place, okay, what�s the restaurant�s policy about people eatin� that?
Well, come on...|So... where does everyone summer?
Joey!|You should scream at me, or-or-or curse me, or hit me.
You can do the presentation.|No, I can't, I have a baby.
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here.  No... Oh God... Oh!|What?
Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...|Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls. (Joey bangs on
You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".|um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".
Uh-uh. Ok. What time is that.|You don't know military time?
Do you have any ideas?|Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Yes!
So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.|Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|I did not care for that!
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|This is unbelievable.
Excuse me?|Rach we have a code brown situation.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|One, two, three!
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.
I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.|Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|I'm gonna get some more coffee.
All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.|Ow!
Yeah.|Good-bye.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|We are gonna be great parents.
Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!|Alright.
Uh!|Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.|Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet our friends?
Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.|Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at  ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...
I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have… have a great one!|It's not the best!
well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?|What�s the matter with me? Why I�m such a girl?
Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.|No.
But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...|He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
Nighty-night!|What audition?
Congratulatioooons!|Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
...If-you-say-so.|Are you kidding?
Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.|Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?
Calm ourselves?|No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|YEAH...! How great is this...?
Two!|Three!
Ah, who is Emma?|I told you about my daughter.
Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.|Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
Hey Mom! No, that's just my secretary.|Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.
I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.|Okay.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Yeah!
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.
Yeah.|Bye.
Ouh…|Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?
Hey!|Hi.
The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?|Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!|Wow.
Okay.|God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|Yeah... The woman you what?
No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.|Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that...  what happens to cranberry sauce?
Yay.|Uhm, actually no. No, you've... You have to get off the plane.
Good job.|Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound � and the breasts of a Greek goddess.|Pheebs?
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring!|Hey!
|I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
YAY!|Shhh!
Phoebe!|I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
You took the same class twice.|Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|Babies don't care if they're slim.
I don't know, but it sounds great.|Your agent called. You got that audition.
Yes, she jumped right back up.|Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!
Hey, hey!|You okay?!
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.|Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.
If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom.|Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!!
Then what did happen?|Yes, you did!
What do you really want to do?|I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.|But... you suck!
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|Right, is it painful?
Hey, I was looking out for you.|Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|How do you feel about that?
Sure.|Things you find in the ocean,  You're gonna be on "Pyramid"!!
We don't.� But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.� You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.|Oh that's so cute:� Ross and Mike's first date.� Is that going to be awkward?� I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
Wow!|Really? Do you not know Chandler?
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.|I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
I don't think so.|I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Hey, so what is the big surprise?
I lent them to Ross.|I don't care.
But he's the same.|Joey, come on!
Come on, I don't know what else to do.|Fine, fine.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds around again.
Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!|Wow. Ok.
Oh God, I can�t believe you�re making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!|Oh, really!
You can really arrange that?|You let Rachel come back, and it’s done.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said "Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani." Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.|Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose!  Did I? I haven’t slept in forty hours and…it does sound like something I would do.
Yeah.|My cousin's a paleontologist.
Thank you.|But I am going hunting!!
But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.|I see... Thanks very much.  Is this your son?
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.
No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?|I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.
I'm sorry, no.|Okay.
I lent them to Ross.|Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
Isn’t she beautiful?|As we all are at some point during the day.
Thank you guys for having us over.|I do, he's been working on that all day!
Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.|Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.
My fajitas!!|Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
So what? Don�t you have any will power?|Will power? I�ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs  without taking the tin foil off.
Alright-y then.|Ok, are they listening?
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.
Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.|Me too!
Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.|Sure, ok, yeah.
What do you really want to do?|"A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?|I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
You gonna tell her?|Like only if the queen comes?
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|What about the obsessive cleaning?
That's a, that's a long time.|You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?|Wendy Knoller
Oh, no problem.|And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.|Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
Oh, look at her, so happy!|Hey, is uhm... is Chandler here?
Right and then everybody finds out and they're like: "Oh, I knew all along"|I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: "Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay"
Dude!|Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?
Oh man.|Dude, you see right thru me!!
Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.|I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...?  That slayed me.
See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.|Break up with Charlie!
Seriously?|Yeah-uh!
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|Some people don't
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.|But also knowing it means a lot.
I'm not lying to you, I watched it!|Well, you lied again!
Erica, are you okay?|Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Yeah...|That's right I am!
no they don't|: then why were you watching them and giving YOURSELF a treat.
Oh, thank you so much!|Oh!
Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?|Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|So glad you came!
I’m sorry, I can’t believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!|Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don’t order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That’s a good way to lose some fingers!
Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.|That's great.
Oh...|What?
That was a test and you just failed.|Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
It’s the baby’s buttock, she’s breech.|Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
That's so sweet. Find anything?|Slim Pickings.
Oh!|Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
Oh yeah? How’d yours happen?|Well, it’s a long story. It’s kind of embarrassing. Let’s just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual.  How about you?
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.|I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now, Joe!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Oh my God!
Hey Gunther, can I get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?|Diapers huh?
Yeah. Me.  Hey uh, I take it you’re just visiting someone.|Uh-huh, yeah.
Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two  like that?|That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?
A pigeon, a pigeon.  are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.|Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that�s true.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|
How much were you thinking?|Ten bucks a game?
Her name is Deliah.|Oh, that's pretty.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|"Bastard"!
Isn’t she beautiful?|What about Ben?
Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.|That's great.
Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.|Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?
Ok|Have a seat through the glass doors.
May I help you?|Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.|Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...
Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..|Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.|Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it…
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|What, what, what, no, I don't wanna do that.
Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.|I can't believe this.
I don't know.� But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.� He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.� He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.|Yeah.
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|That doesn't matter! We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies! I don't care if the entire cast of "Eight is Enough" comes out of there! We are taking them home, because they are our children!
Oh my God!|Yeah, well, I guess you don�t need my help Victor Victoria!
You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.|No, it wasn't.
Nothing! What do you say to that?|Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!
You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well behaved and... single.|So what? I mean if even I can get past that, it shouldn't bother you. And you don't have to like her. You just have to accept the fact that I do. I mean, if you even can't be civil to the woman I love...
Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?|Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.
Hey!|Hey!
Hi!|Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
Hey!|Shoot. Oh, I can't believe I did this!
What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like|Are you kidding?
Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?|Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!
Oh, I like my job.|You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?|. Please tell me those are clip-ons.
… that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.|I see. You didn't happen to tell…
Hey, what are you doing?|Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
You don't mind me touching your belly, do you?|No, no, I knew .
Did he go out for a cigarette?|Yeah, four times.
Thank you.|Oh! I though the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian!
Okay.  Let's get this bad boy on the road.|Is it okay that I want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?
Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.|No, that's David.
Hey.|You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.|Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
Can you hear me say "You're grounded"?|You said that to me last week.
No, it's just... I was enganged to a guy who turned out to be gay!|Hey! High-five!
14?|Joey had an imaginary childhood friend. His name was?
Yeah, sure!|Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!
You know, he was just doing his job...|Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?|What? I get my own room?
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.
What?!|Um uh…We’re-we’re just having this baby together but uh, uh that’s all.
Yeah.|I didn't know you guys hung out.
We are NOT signing those papers.|Why not?
Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.|Hey, that was an honest mistake!
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.
Oh, look at her, so happy!|What?
Yeah.|Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
Good!|Keep pushing!
Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.|So, why are you still wearing it?
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Well, actually...
Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?|Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.
Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.|Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!
Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?|You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.|And I love Crap.
Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.|How do you think she's doing?
You've never said that in your life, have you?|Not once.
Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.|Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. (thinks for a few
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|Oh...  Well...
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?|Think he washed his hands?
Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.|What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
Okay, if Joey does the ceremony, then we have to find someone else to walk Phoebe down the isle.|I'll do it.
I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.|I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
Oh God!|No, it's okay, you didn't know.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Hey.
Five! Four! Three! Applause!|Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...
Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!|Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.
Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you�re right. I think � listen, listen!|Ubb.
You might want to keep practicing.|I heard him again!
Jack, look at this.|Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
Jack, look at this.|No, it did not.
What is the matter with us?|Well, I know what's the matter with me.
Whoo-hoo!|You put holes in my baby's ears!
I'll tell you at the wedding.|What?
I saw you.|Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for "Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal."
Wait! Whoa-whoa, you…you gave her the ring?|No, I didn’t!
So, do you guys wanna come and eat dinner at the restaurant sometime in the next few weeks?|Sure!
Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?|You don't trust him?
Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in|Not Joey.
Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.|Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
Really?|Yeah.
Okay.|Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
I….can’t….believe this!|And yet somehow it’s true!
Actually, I just gave up my practice.|What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…|Oh look, she’s pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?  She looks scared. Doesn’t she look scared?
Yeah...|Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.
We need to talk to you about something.|That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
Yeah...!?|How did she get me to settle down?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|You know, I had a chance to stop her too!
Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.|Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.|Ben Weiss
They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.|They thought Joey was a child?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
Nighty-night!|Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.
Ok!|Oh my God! You're good!
Gotcha.|No!
By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way, bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century.|It's great. You're gonna be the hit of the conference.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.
Your first marriage?|Yeah.
Dude, I was gonna ask her out.|I said it first, bro.
Nighty-night!|Hey, good race you guys.
Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.|No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.|Are you looking to meet somebody?
OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...|YEAH!
Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.|That is a bad interview.
People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin|Don't be. It's just bad timing.
Hey.|Hey.
Alright, Emma is napping...  what happened to your shirt?|We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time!  OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
Uh-huh.|It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
I wasn't. Let's get going!|Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.|Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
Sure!|Ok.  Thank you for coming with me today.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
Fifth day's a charm.|Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
So?|So I don’t wanna be just anybody.
Ow...Oh Gosh!|It’s umm, it has something to do with transponding.
You won awards?|Hi.
Oh!|Everyone. Erica, baby!
It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize,  whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.|Oh my God, I completely forgot! .
Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.|Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
Incentive For Men?|Pheebs, that's for men!
Because we're moving in a couple of days and it just didn't make sense.|Erica, those things aren't free. In fact they have one of the highest mark-ups of any consumer product...
Ross, say something. Anything.|Yeah.
No! Stop!|Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.
Thank you guys for having us over.|You too! What are the odds?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Get a room!
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|And... moment's over!  You know what? You're done.
What, oh my God. What did you do?|Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.|I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.
I'm out of here|I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!
Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?|I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.
Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".|je.
Well, not this second!|Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
We won!|Let me see!
Oh my God! He did it?|Well…did you know he was gonna ask me?
All right.|You can go.
Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.|No, no! Give it to me!
Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.|Sounds like he's with someone.
Joseph!  Thou needn�t worry, they shan�t be long.|It�s just that we do have some large parties waiting.
I lent them to Ross.|Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
Okay, well, bye!|Bye!
Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.|Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
Joey, do you speak French?|Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
Can somebody please go in?|Absolutely.
: how do you know I have one of those?|I said I think you're hot and now I'm embarrassed.
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.|Oh, hi Chandler. It's Phoebe. Uhm... I know that Monica is working today so... ...I was wondering if you want to come to the movies with me and Rachel.
What do you really want to do?|I have *not* thought this through!
You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?|Marta Kauffman & David Crane
I'm sorry.|I'm sorry too.
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Wow? Really? That's fantastic!
Doctor Connelly just called.|With good news?  "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
This is bringing out a lovely color in you!|So? Do you think we should get it?
Why not?|Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
No, it starts with a silent "M".|Oh come on!!
Wow, this place looks great.|Oh! You are gonna love it!  and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
This is Joey Tribbiani. Joey, these are the producers and, as you probably already know, this is Lennart Haze.|"I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't."
It's really gone?|Well, I tried Billy Jean King, but...
Yeah...|I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
Oh!|So, so sorry.
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!|It was nice to meet you Rachel.
Hi|Hey!
She has a lot of crap!|Did you just say Emma?
Who, who are they?|I know them from work.
Yeah it is.|What the hell are you doin'?
That’s fine, for now we’ll just call her Baby Girl Green.|Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
So.|Yeah.
Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.|Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?
Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.|Picturing that tree?
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|No, no!
Hey!|Hey!
Yeah.|Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
Jack, look at this.|Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|How?
You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you?  Now, I don't actually have a ring...|David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|What, hey!
No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.|Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.
Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?|Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
Yes, but we have to be fast.|You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|What are you doing here, Geller?
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Hair Straightener?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|You guys know where Rachel is?
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|Oh my God. It's like Sophie's Choice.
Baby got back|One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.|He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
Really?|I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.
Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.|That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark airport.
Well I don't mind, I'll cancel. I would never miss my secretary's birthday.|Shh!
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Now, what is this?
I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.|I don't know, I mean I'm not sure  ...
Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?|Not really.
Ok.  Wha...? where? Where are you going?|Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "who's more over who"!
Oh!  Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?|Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
Well, come on...|Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle.
Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.|Dana Klein
We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.|Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  I wish I'd thought this through.|I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
Look Phoebe, It's not about you. I just never wanna get married again.|Oh!
That's sweet. Drink your hair.|Hey, what's all this stuff?
Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.|Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? . Yeah!
Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.|Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?
|She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
Yeah...|Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!|I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|Okay. Wow.
That's great!  I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...|Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.
Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.|Yes, doctor.
What the hell are you doin'???|I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?...
Hey guys! Dinner's ready!|So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!
: how do you know I have one of those?|HA!
whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?|Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Well, he's with Charlie now.
Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.|You're right.  Maybe I shouldn't go.
Isn’t she beautiful?|What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|Phoebe and Rachel saw you with Nancy today and... em... they think you're having an affair.
You gonna tell her?|Maybe not even then.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|Ross, how about you. What would you give up, sex or food?
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|Thank you for a delightful stay.
No. It starts with a "v" and ends with an "x". Helpfully with a "to" in the middle.|You know, kinda think of it, the capital of Peru IS "vtox".  Oh god! Oh!
Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?|I sent them home.
Chandler, what are you talking about?|Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
But do you wanna get back together?|I don't know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Although...
Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?|Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.
Oh man.|Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.
And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.|...that center around work.
You got it!  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!|No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.
No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.|I quit and you learn what I do?
Hey!|Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
I don't know what... you're talking about.|Really?
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!|That's right, yeah.
He... he's gonna propose?|I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!
I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."|He isn't?!
Your age?|See all of you tomorrow.
After you, miss Banana Hammock.|Thank you, mister Bag.
No, honey, its. thats a special plate.  See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.|I can't believe I won.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?
Congratulatioooons!|That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
That's my bubby!|So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.� Um. . . maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
Hey Joey!|Hey!
Yeah, Ross is here so...|We're gonna have sex.
You're filthy!|Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
I'm gonna get the lasagna.|Hey Rach...
Hey!|Oh my God! I have nothing left to teach you!
Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well, umm…then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.|Yeah, maybe.
But I-I was going to see if y’know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that—I mean that-that was all, Rach.|Dude, step up! I proposed.
Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.|Oh, thank you...
God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.|Does he?
You might want to keep practicing.|Yah.
I’m just mad at my agent.|Estelle? Why?
|Well, hey! How about right above the TV? . That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!
My fajitas!!|Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
Je m'appelle Claude.|Je depli mblue.
Incentive For Men?|It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!
Ok, ok, so how should I do it?|
What did it say?|Nude... ... pictures of Anna Kournikova. I'm so sorry.
Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...|Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!
How late are we?|Forty-five minutes.
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|I don't know. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Wha... the next one?
Hey you.|You’re weird today.  Listen I uh, wanted to talk to you about something.
Again, you're welcome.|Look, I'll just give you this and go.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Uh ... Mommy?
What?|Wow!
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?|Uhh, uh...
Love it!|Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
Jack, look at this.|
Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.|Yeah, I guess you're right.
man sharks. I always knew there was something weird about that dude. But you promised to love him no matter what.|: what means if he gets like a disease or kills someone. not if he gets his jollys to jaws!
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|You wanna get married?
The nurse said they’re bringing in another woman.|Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn’t need to be; she’ll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.|I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
Don't you want to look through the rest?|I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
Merry Christmas.|Merry Christmas, you guys!
I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.|I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
Isn’t she beautiful?|No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!
Sorry. . You ok?|Yeah.
We’re seriously asking for our money back?|Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn’t want, but it turns out we do.
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|I uhm... I completely understand.
You still don't know my name, do you?|Yes.
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Yep.� That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn.� Single are ya?
Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.|Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
Estrangement .|No, you can�t go. No-no-no, I can�t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.
I can't believe you didn't know it's twins! This has never happened before.|Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.|I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Why the hell did you take her?
Wow!|Hey, check this out! It’s totally you!
I said it's still nap time.|18, uh?
Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.|Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.
It was great.|Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!|Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
I lent them to Ross.|And?
Time for your scalp massage!|
That's what I hear, yeah.|This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Are you leaving "The Supremes"?
I have nothing to say to you.|Wow, my flat is twice this size!
I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.|Yeah.... she's not so cute.
I have to go to the bathroom.|You must be a fireball in bed.
No! We're not borrowing money.|Why not?
You still don't know my name, do you?|I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?|You're kidding!
No! We're gonna do it my way.  Hello?|I'm glad we had this little talk.
Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this...  HUGE engagement ring!|My God!
Your lipstick's on his mouth.|No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.
Jack, look at this.|No.
What?|ooh...
You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.|Hey!
Who is he?|Some guy, Tom Gordon.
Joey proposed to you?|I can come back.
What did you get her?|Separate performances.
No you really think that's what it is?|You heard him! "No bigger!" "You're perfect!" "Just don't get any bigger!" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.
Uh huh...we're playing you two.|We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Oh. <opens door preparing herself and then happily says>
Nighty-night!|Bye, bye.
Uhm, right!|...It's kinda hard though!
Huh? Ooh  you mean like a… Huh?|Ross, I know you’re pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.
No, that seems about right.|Alright  I feel youger already!
Everything was delicious!|Thank you!
Gotcha.|So, how did you enjoy the play?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Oh.. man..
I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?|Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!
Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?|I really don't.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!|Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh!  Wow! You remember Joey?
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.|Are you serious?
No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!|Yes, but the batteries...
Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?|Absolutely! Or maybe just a little less pimp spit.
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|What? what is the matter with you?
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|I can't believe you guys went for that one!
What's going on?|We?
I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...|No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?
Hey... Wh... What are you doing?|I'm trying to get your parents to like me.
Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.|Wrong number?
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?
Oh, we are so lucky!|I know. He has your eyes.
So, what are we gonna do today?|They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
Right!|Yeah, that was an awesome day!
But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.|Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.|Alright, ok, let's do it.  And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.
Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!|Well, I have huge news.
And you would?|I did!
How drunk are you?|Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|Actually, we already found a house we love.
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|That was ME!
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Yeah.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Oh my God.
Sure.|I'm gonna take her back to the appartment.
Here we go!|Oh it’s okay. They’re just-they’re just wrapping her up.
Of course, I'd be honored!|Hey Phoebe!
Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?|I'd love to! Yeah!
Estrangement .|Pheebs, who the hell�uhuhh!
What?|How could you not remember that we slept together?
Previously on Friends...|All right, we'll work it out.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|You bitch. You just think you're so perfect. With your new baby and your, your small apartment. <directs this to Ross who in turns throws the towel in his hand down on the table> Well let me tell you something. Your baby isn't even that cute.
Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say "neither".|Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: "Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks..."
Tulsa, Oklahoma!|The Sooner State, whatever that is.
|All right! Well, uh...  we're gonna hit the beach?
Boss!|Mint!
Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.|So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|Pass!
I like those odds!|Kinda like Joey.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.|Well, don't be.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|I.. I.. I need a good lie.
Where is everyone? They�re forty minutes late.|I know, u-uch.
Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!|One Two Three...
Oh no, Rach, no no, you know you’re never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.|Well I can do whatever I want!  I made her!  Come on little girl, hi!
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
Joey, wait!|
Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.|So, what are you gonna do?
Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.|I don't care about any of that!!
Who is it?|Yes! yes!
How can you be so confident?|Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!
Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..|I haven't slept in four years!
Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.|Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...|So basically all nuts?
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Yeah?
Please... Chandler is the love of my life...|... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.
Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!|I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
Oh man.|Promise to call me when you land.
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.
Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who ever|OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
Why not?|You know what? You don’t need a thesaurus, just write from here,  your full sized aortic pump.
That was a test and you just failed.|I respectfully disagree.
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.|Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.|
Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.|No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|I ... I was just talking about Rachel.
Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?|Answer better, answer better!
Well, I might.|Right... Goodbye Phoebe.
Yeah!|fellas
So, we're just four losers... SUPER!|I'm not playing with you.
But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ain’t that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright . See, here’s the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she won’t go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is Italy—Please don’t make me go there!|Chandler, I…
Oh, thanks.|But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
Okay what’s up|Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Well, I've been better.
I know.|You're a really good kisser.
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|I do not.
Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?|I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.
It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?|And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
Yes.|I am the guy who�s taking care of our baby while you�re out at bars meeting guys!
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!|You know, I would give her up, for you.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....
Your Veal Chop is $34,95!|C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|I do yoga.
Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say "neither".|I knew you didn't get a 1400!
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|"I am what you made me! You know what?"
Hurry!|Good luck, good luck!
Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up.  Look Emma, look who's baaack!|Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
Work, Joe!|Damn it!
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|You know what, if you wanna look for a house, that's okay.
And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?|What kind?
What are you doing here?|Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
Oh, it’s the worst way to propose!|.
Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!|Did you just push me?
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!|Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!|Can you really live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?
No... he killed his father with a shovel.  But other than that, he's a great guy.|Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
Where?|Mexico!
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I�m not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she�s doing at home and I�m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!
No it's not!|When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.|I know. With Gukki
Heh.|Uhm... well, they're not in the wedding.
So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?|Yeah. It's actually our first official date
Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?|Hey.
Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!|Tails!
Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.|Can I talk now?
If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.|Has it always been purple?
Hey, what are you kidding me?|Right-o, right-o...
Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.|They did?
Well you can't! We're booked solid for the next month!|What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont !
Uh, Gene, you're gonna have a chance to go to the winner circle in the second half. But right now Henrietta you are going to the winner circle to try your luck for ten thousand dollars, right after this, don't go away.|Hey! I got a kid starting college. I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!
Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.|Exactly!!
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.|Ah, look who’s back!  Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?
Nighty-night!|Everybody get your toys!
Oh, ok, thank you.  Do you see what all the guys see in her?|Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.|Oh!
Lowell, is that you?|Phoebe?  Oh my god!
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.|Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus...
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Make me rich!!
Gotcha.|Oh, Very funny... Joey.
You're crazy.|Crazy, or... romantic?
Oh please, hit by a blimp?|It kills over one americans every year.
Whenever you're ready Joey.|Right.  Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?|It can be anything you want.
Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!|Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.|Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Oooh, I like that, "daddy"
No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?|That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!
Oh, she’s so beautiful.|It’s incredible, I mean one minute she’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Yeah.
Where the hell is everybody?|Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.
Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...|It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!
Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.|Is that a bit you guys do?
Oh man.|Bye Chandler.
Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.|Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Hey, did you stop by here?
What... for how long?|Only like a month!
I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.|Ross, we can solve this. I just heard your speech. We can recreate it! We've got all night!
Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress.  Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!|Oh, .. uh... uh... pass.  Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
Thank you.|Oh wow, this feels weird.
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at|Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|You put an offer on a house?
What? I-I don't.|You don't?
You really think so?|Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
|Bye!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Oh my God!
Previously on Friends...|Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
Hey!|No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
|Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller
Oh yeah, sure. No problem.|What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!|Ooh! We have a problem.
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Hey guys.
Yeah, where were you!|And it looks like she put makeup on her!
I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?|It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.
Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!|Oh, I'm so sorry!
What?|Newark airport. Why, where are you?
"Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?|Every little bit of you!
Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.|But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
Oh, Come on!|Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?|What the hell are you talking about??
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|That's not what we're gonna do!
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|That would be advice!!
Previously on Friends...|Okay.
Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!|This is... great...
Yeah, actually I am!|I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
Pleased to meet you.|Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Who is it?|
Wow! That was amazing!|I was not ready for this today!
Broke them all, huh?|Yep...
Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.|That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!
Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?|I can't believe he's that upset about this...
Uh huh...we're playing you two.|I hear wedding bells.
You're fly is open, Geller!|[looking outside the window] Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!|Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Oh my god, then...
Congratulatioooons!|Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
Hey, here you go.|Nobody, forget it!
How far outside?|Manhattan.
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was. Now the thing I wanna say is... maybe we should have talked about this before. Us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?|Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?|Not there.
Oh man.|I love you so much.
Well, Chandler’s my oldest friend, but Joey’s my—No! Ah!|Ooooo!
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. <gets up and walks into the kitchen> And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.
Everything doesn't sound fine!|Is he alright out there by himself?
I really, really think I would remember sleeping with you|come on, come on, search your brain all right. it was  here, here, here NOT there. Anything?
Don't tear it.|Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
We're just making conversation.|Ok listen, you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight and I'm flattered and... and quite frankly a little frightened. Can we just talk about something else?
Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.|No.
Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.|Don’t say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
Honey why don’t you go lie down.|No, no, Ross and Rachel will be back soon and then I gotta go to the office  Am I producing them?
I like those odds!|Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
Just a second.|No, no, no, no, no.� Joey can't know that I'm here.
Even if we want it really bad.|That's what we decided.
What happened?|I'll do it!
Yay.|This is ridiculous! I...
Look, if Phoebe wants to marry David, she should, I'm not gonna stand in the way of that and neither should you.|And there's not chance that will work?
What are you doin'?|Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
Yes! You know, in six months the Statute of Limitations runs out and I can travel internationally again!|I'm gonna miss you so much.
What?|OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
: Joey I am not going to objectify woman with you  but if her face is as nice as her ass woah mamma.|Alright thanks, Oh hey have you talked to Chandler?
Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what…|What's your news?
I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.|Okaaay... so eh... so tell me, how did you guys meet.
Oh, that's not cool.|Dude, none of this is cool.
I just realized why I remember this place.|Really? What is it?
Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!|So you'll be ok?
Tough crib.|Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
AH YEAAAAH!|Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy...|Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.
Incentive For Men?|Ok!
Sometimes just nodding is ok.  Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!|You’re right, you’re right! I’m gonna do it!
No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!|Wow, what's the bad news!
That sounds like fun.|You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?
What was that?|Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn… on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house!|Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that…
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
Mike and I broke up.|You're kidding me. Because I'm not seeing anybody, I've just totally made that up.
I don't care. <pauses and realizes...> Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.|She needs changing.
Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.|All right! Who is he?
I need to talk to you about Charlie.|Oh, do you, do you really?
I'll tell you at the wedding.|Uh.
Well, I took it.|You're excited, right?
Ah, you mean lager.|Ah yeah.� Good times.
Oh hey you guys, I couldn�t get a reservation for the night of my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.|Thursday? But that�s Halloween.
I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.|You're not sick!
Who's Nancy?|Uhm, she has been showing us houses outside of the city.
I�m starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate nothing all day.|What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.
I understand...|Oh...
Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.|When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.|Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.
Seriously? You divorce-o?|If you have to call me name, I prefer "Ross the Divorcer". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.
So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?|Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.|Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Who is it?
Awesome.|Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met.
Trust me, I will never...|Yeah I get that.
Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.� You know, like, "Hi, How do I look?"�  "Really sexy.� Could I BE any more turned on?"|Okay.� � Whoa, whoa.� Why are there two glasses of wine out?
Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.|This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.|No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?
Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.|We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
I'm still looking through mine...|Oh my God, congratulations!
Hi!|Hey!
Yeah, maybe.|Then you gotta let them go.
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|Phoebe, you have to calm down.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Christie Turlington, Kate Moss...
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|You heard them say that?
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Yeah, you too.
What's up?|Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
So, you just let her go?|Hey, maybe that's for the best.
I was just gonna call you! That’s weird.|It’s a little coincidental, but believable. . Listen, I’m sure you’re wondering why I didn’t get you an audition for that TV movie.
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!|I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?
You might want to keep practicing.|Dude, come home!
Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?|Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!|Hey guys!
Yes, but we have to be fast.|Hello?
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Oh.
Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?|Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
Haha!|You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
Well, mine was worse than that.|Well, what happened?
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|What? I don't get a goodbye?
Uh!|No thanks!
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Yeah.
Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.  Man, I really bug you, don't I?|Ready for your birthday lunch?
Jack, look at this.|Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh?  Ok!
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|Why would I eat my own arm?
Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.|I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|God! I can't believe she saved me for last.  Why are they taking so long?
Mmh-mmh.|Can you say Barbados?
Dude, you're shaking!|I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?|Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.
Crap Bag.|Mike Crap Bag?
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
|Yeah, I see what you mean.� By the way, nice Ross imitation.
IT'S THE HUMIDITY!|Phoebe, I love you. I mean, I missed you so much these last few months and I thought we were apart for a good reason, but then I suddenly realized that there was no reason good enough to keep me from spending the rest of my life with you.
Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!|He's the boss's son.
All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in|It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?
Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?|Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
Oh, why? What's up?|I did not know you spoke French.
Do you have to go?|I call their apartment!!!
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Actually what?
Where are Bill and Colleen?|They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Dude, it's just "Days of Our Lives"... there's no the.
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.|We’re gonna be roomies!  Come on!
New York.|The big apple!
Yeah.|I love ya.
Oh right, uhm, Don?|Close. Ron.
Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.|Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.|Scott Silveri
Right.|I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?  Not easy.
Of course, I'd be honored!|Hey!
Thanks!|Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
your ass?!?!?|Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!
Your thumb? That’s weird.  Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.|You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.
Hi Frank.|Hi, how you doin'?
Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.|Seriously? She actually said that?
Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."|Hear me out woman.� I'll go down the fire escape.� Then, I'll wait for a while.� Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.� Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
Hello?|I LOVE MY NEW JOB!
Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?|I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.
Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it...|Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt!  Here David, you should just go.
That's not how you really feel is it?|No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.
Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.|That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
It’s the baby’s buttock, she’s breech.|Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
yea you know you are a bit of a drama queen.|but you, your so much better off you just go from guy to guy having fun and never worrying that it terns into anything serious.
It's a... It's a boy!|He's just fine.
Hey, who's Phoebe with?|Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
Nighty-night!|No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose.  The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.|I missed most of the party  Charlie's a girl, right?
You are not at Thanksgiving?|We're late too!
yeah well  yeah you know Emma's birth certificate might say Geller but her eyes say Mookurgee.|that is so wrong and on top of that his a glue sniffer.
Rachel you’re gonna have to push even harder, nothing’s happening!|I’m sorry, I can’t!
Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!|Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
I did not see that coming.|Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
We're moving in a couple of days and we've got a lot of packing to do. It would be great if you guys could pitch in.|Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
Yay.|Well, I can't take this plane now.
How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.|From school.
No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!|I know, I'm her!
Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!|Who...?
You won awards?|YES, YES!
You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.|Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
I'm so sorry...|Oh!
Je m'appelle Claude.|Je do call blue!
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|Sure! Look, ok, bottom line: I love Mike... David! David. I love David. Don't look at me that way, Roseanne Rosannadanna!
Hey!|Hey, Rach, you're leaving tomorrow, shouldn't you be packing?
You had a rough day, uh?|Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
well, this is, this is, this is not over!  Hello?|So? Did have sex, right?
|O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?
I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!|Who's Amanda?
Yeaah.|Amy, that’s what I was supposed to wear today, that’s why I hung it on the door.
I've never given her a cookie. Have you?|No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!
Car accident.|Oh.
A place to eat spaghetti.|Very good!  What do you need it for anyway?
I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!|No, no, no, we’re not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.|I don't know, probably just invest it.
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|No problem roomie.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
Hey, hey!|Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?
Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.|You may wanna get some more of those too.
Thank you guys for having us over.|Ooh!
Nighty-night!|Way to go robot!
Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!|Hi there.
You didn't like that?|Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.
Can I adopt you?|What?
What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife?� Huh?� Do you think I'm like, "Duh."�|Joey?
All right, everybody open them!|Ooh! Oh wow this is so beautiful.
Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!|Yeah, yeah, oh!
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|So Rach.
Sure.|Joey is gonna be a celebrity guest on a game show!
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|Yeah, sure... uhm, I'm devastated, obviously...
...kiss him?|Yes, but uhm... You should know... she really likes you. I-In fact I-I-I don't think you realise j-just how lucky you are fella.
I'm still looking through mine...|Oh yeah.
Do you have to go?|I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
What!?|This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
through the glass doors.|Through the glass doors.
The chocolates aren't here yet.|Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
So?|So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?
That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.|Joey.
You're a pig. And you can't do this.|The hardware store is right down the street.
Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...|She won a thousand dollars!
How was your date with Joey?|Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!
Hey!|Ok, so you've done some good work!  What about your carry-ons?
What about your massage client?|Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.|Oh my God!
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you
Hey!|aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
Wher-where have you been?|Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!
No, that seems about right.|You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.
|Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|A torch, a bonfire...  uhm, your pee...
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Aaargh, sexual politics!!
How do you know about that?|When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!|Hey! Hey what's going on?
The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.|Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
Yeah, well, being a failed scientist doesn't pay quite as well as you might think. That's uhm... one seventieth of a karat. And the clarity is uhm... is quite poor.|See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?
Oh yeah.|Phoebe come here
I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?|What?
Uh. It's not... quite what I'm saying.|Really? It sounds exactly the same to me.
Wow.|You know what, it’s, it’s better this way anyway. I mean I don’t know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It’s just much easier if we’re just friends who have a kid.
Canoodling?|Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.|Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
The wife says "Hi!".|Ah. Fun conversation?
Congratulatioooons!|Don't make me come up there!
I have to go to the bathroom.|Have I gone deaf?
What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?|Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.
A-alright! I can do this.|There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game.|No, too late. You can't give it back!
What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?|Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
Should we send something?|He offered me one.
... all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!|No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
You got it!  Let's put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him!|Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|
yes, yeah I said something stupid about her never having had a serious relationship, but you should know she is so much fun, a wonderful person please don't blow her off.|I'm not blowing her off, I actually just got off the phone with her, were going out tomorrow night, I mean I hope that's ok with you stranger from the coffee house.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|My boyfriend canceled on me. I mean.. I I finally find a real relationship. I mean, someone that I can spend this day with and then his wife comes back into town. I swear, its almost not worth dating married guys.
We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.|Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|Uh actually, we-we’ve narrowed it down to two names.
You're... weird!|Your pants are undone!
Well, yeah.|Okay.� Well, thanks, ah, thanks for the beer.
Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "  You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!|Hey!
Yay.|We're all getting off. There is no Philange!
Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it!|Okay, you come up with an idea.
That's not really how it works.|Oh, how does it work?
Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?|Oh, yeah! Let's do it!
"You know!"|"I don't know!"
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|What are you doing here?
She has a lot of crap!|Ass and face.
What?!|They said it could be up to a year.
No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.|Oh,  hey, oh... I... I was-I was going for a hand shake.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Center ice.
Good, God's speed, good people!  You're not gonna go?|Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.
Good!|You have no idea how much this hurts.  Keep going! Keep going!
You took the same class twice.|Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back .
SSSHHHHTTT!!He's asking her a question!!|Don't say that...
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.|Hey!
Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.|Hi.
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!|Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
Aw � what?|N-no, Emma dropped her sock.
But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.|What have you heard me sing?
Oh hi!|Who’s this little guy?
Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.|Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...
Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!|Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...|It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
Yes.|Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.
Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!|Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.|Really?
Dear Lord.|I’m sorry honey, what were you saying?
You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.|There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.|Oh, my maple candy!
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|What do we do?
I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart...|Are you gay?
Uh, Joe?|Damn it!
Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...|We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this.
Yeah, yeah, and directing.|You saw that?
Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.|This is it. Unless we're on a break.
Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...|Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!
Really, really not.|Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.
Again, you're welcome.|Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.
Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents: Theodore and Bitsy.|Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!
We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.|Hi you guys!
Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?|Dr. Drake who?
You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.|Why?
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.|Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.|Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.|We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
What? Wha-wha-wha-did you do ROSS!|oh boy you got mad at that part. I went over there to tell him how great you are but you know me BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, and I ended up telling him that.
I like those odds!|Boohaki?
Have you seen him throw a ball?|Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.
She's mine!|She's m-i-i-ne!
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Y�know this ??? is incredible.
Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.|Oh good.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|Yeah, we'll be okay.
So.|Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?
What a small world!|And yet I never run into Beyonce!
Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.|No.
You have gotta stop!|But she liked us.
What!? They are totally ripping us off!|Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
I don't know...|One more fight!
Ooh...|Just the crab cakes.
You know, ah, I’ve been thinking about this and I gotta tell ya, it’s not my fault. It’s a natural instinct.|Hey, what you guys talking about?
What...that scene I saw was so good!|Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
14?|Correct, his profession was?
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.
I can't do that!|All right. � Hello?� Hi.� I'm sorry about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
Okay Marjorie, hit it.|Geez Ross, you could have showered.
He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...|Oh, well... That had been your window.
I got you something from Vermont!|Shana Goldberg-Meehan
Hey!|Hey!
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|What?
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.|I love you!
Oh!|"She never loved me, she only loved you."
Oh!|It's okay, it's just an egg roll.
Hey, Charlie!|Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.|Chandler, you're panicking!
Okay, so... allright... Which dress?  You can say "neither".|Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...
Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.|You're not Rachel.
Fine!|Thank you.
Previously on Friends.|Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Oh come on, that was 20 years ago. Get over it.
Yeah...|You know, by the way. I heard you tell her not to do anything. Thanks for sticking up for me. You are such a nice person.
Yay.|Phoebe? Is everything okay?
Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!|Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.
Alright, alright, let's do this!|Okay!
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|Hey!
Ok, careful.|Ok.
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|Umm, Delilah.
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.
whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!|See?
And that�s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?|Thanks. Oh.
|Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|It's not a word!
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Right. Except that I do want to get married.
Uhm... Stockholm.|Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
Ok!|It's like watching porn!
Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.|Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.
Hey!|Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.|Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
Dessert?|Grand Supreme Little Darling?
Again, you're welcome.|See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?
Oh my God! That’s the doctor who was in my room before!|Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Hey.
|Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Friends!
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?|She died.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Dude I just did something terrible.
Incentive For Men?|Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.
Thank you.|Hey, what do you say we celebrate? Champagne?
well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.|Emma.
Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!|Huh!
You might want to keep practicing.|Okay.� Great.� I'll see you when you get here.� I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.|Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?|Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!|You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.
Um, can I come back in?|
As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die.  So, excuse me for being a little skittish.|Oh, play them!
Me too!|Here
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|You son of a bitch!
Other wall, people! Other wall!|Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
Well, I might.|Okay, well... guys?
Name?|Chandler Bing.
I'm so sorry...|Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know?� I should just . . . move on with my life.|Really?� You're moving on from Ross?
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
Joey's gonna be *so* upset.|Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
Hey|Hey. So where's Mon?
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|Hey guys.
That's great! That's great! I-I'll propose to her!|What?
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?|I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
Come on in, how are ya?|I'm good!
Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.|Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know, I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate. She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.
Why?|Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.|Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.|I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
Okay...|Which... which... which... Which one is it?
Gotcha.|Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!
I am not doing this over the phone.|You don't have any other choice!
We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.|Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".|Right. I'll be there.
We only ordered one!|Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!
This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...|All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
Isn’t she beautiful?|Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
So you're not friends with him?|OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO!  No!
No, I'm saying...|but, but..
Wow! This place is beautiful!|Wow! This is very flattering, uh...
No!|Joking it is!
Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.|Hey!
So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?|You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.|Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...|Hey!
Hey, Charlie!|Oh, you bet.
I do love you.|I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.
Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?|Who am I?
Oh.|Oh no, no, no, let your dad get this.
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|We don't have a code word.
Okay, that helps.|And...Action!
Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!|I've missed you too.
Oh my god, this really hurts!!!|I couldn’t help it! When a fist comes at your face, you duck! Look!
Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!|...Missy?
Wow.� So, what did you guys do?|It's true.� I did.
Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!|Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|Wow!
Oh, she’s so beautiful.|Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we’re good.
Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?|Oh God! I am so sorry, but...  I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...
Okay.|Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Its a girl?
Great!|So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
Really?|Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
You really think this man is speaking French?|Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui...
It's just my first marriage was, you know such a disaster. I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.|Was it really that bad?
You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.|'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|You got me a cola drink?
Hey!|Oh, that sounds good!
I - I can't believe I�m crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.|Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair.  You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
Ok, we're still on that.|Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...|Homo.
...kiss him?|Oh, well, yeah...
It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.|Me too.
Hiccups.|Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
Oh, look at her, so happy!|We think Chandler might be having an affair.
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|Ready?
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!|Ok
Okay.|Thank you.  Thank you!
You did it!|Robert Carlock & Wendy Knoller
Bye.|Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we…we gotta be careful. We…we can’t let that happen again, y’know?
Oh my God, he's beautiful. Thank you so much.|I'm really happy for you guys.
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.|Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I can�t believe I did this. I can�t believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that|Sure.
Best out of three?|Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
: how do you know I have one of those?|gesundheit
|You got it!
What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?|Oh!  Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?
I'm still looking through mine...|Hey, that is so great about the job.
Bye.|That’s all right.  And so it begins.
Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.|Yeah...
You didn't like that?|Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.
Hey, what's-what's going on?!|Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
Hi! Sorry, I'm late.|Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?
Wow.� So, what did you guys do?|Oh, you know . . . we just drank some beer and Mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.
Well, this is very generous!|Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.
Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.|Congratulations!/Good for you!/Great!
� Why do I smell men's cologne?|I think that's you.
Nighty-night!|I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
Fine, it's fine...  I'll just shower by myself...|B, B, B, B, B!
Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need|Well, we're not.
Which one?|I don't know, what were the names I just said?
Give me twenty seconds on the clock. Ready? Go!|It's made from eggs!
Alright, let's see..|We could trade later.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Did I do something to you?
No! It�s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think it�s a little to soon to show my true colors.|Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma.  Which one of us should go to dinner?
Space is filled with orbiting children.  Look, please, just come on, you know, when you’ll see the look on Emma’s face, I swear you won’t regret it.|All right!
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Guest.
So, did you bring a little something for Ross?|Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?|Yeah, she never misses these conferences!  No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!
Oh, give me!|Yeah. We have rat babies now.
That's great. What kind of music do you play?|Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
Yay.|I'm not flying on it!
Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!|Oh, I missed you so much!
Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?|Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
You might want to keep practicing.|What? Why?
You still don't know my name, do you?|Oh, well,  you're not catching me on my best day.
What are you guys doing?|From?
Hey, here you go.|Ooh... oooh...  Can I ask you a question?
Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!|Call me.
Oh God! Is that veal?|Oh!
OH NO!|What? What is it?
Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!|Oh, you're mean!
If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.|Seriously?
That's the perfect amount!|Okay!
Of course, I'd be honored!|You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.
Yeah, I guess!|I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
Why don't you take Ross?|Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
Madame, you must have your boarding pass..|Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it|Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
Alright-y then.|Well, I think this is a great place to work!
I got you something from Vermont!|do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
Yeah.|Didn't see you there Geller.
Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?|Six!
Can I adopt you?|I got nothing.
No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..|Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|Oh my God!
No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...|Get to the problem!
Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.|But...
Uh, actually, that's..|What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
What?|What?
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?|
Hmm, yeah.  Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.|Mommy
Hey!|Well, it's not.
It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer...  What are you doing?|You don't wanna see what I just saw!
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
All right, let’s get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.|Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|Actually, I really need…
Strike three! You only get one more, Mike!|oh God.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
I can't imagine what he sees in her.|A little better.
Hey!|Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?
Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.|Damn it, I did not think this through!
But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?|Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
Arghhh! Double standards!|Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!|I don't have travel insurance.
Joey, we're not keeping this!|But it's an original Buffay...
Hey!|So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.|Then you're not gonna like what's coming.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|Yeah, well you know what I cannot believe. That my so-called sister, gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren and I still have to pay retail.
I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.|All right.� I've got a plan.� I'll go down the fire escape.
She has a lot of crap!|Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
Yay.|I have this feeling that something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left Philange.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.|Probably not. Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.
Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...|That's it, just sign right on the bra .
IF you hold a spider.|I know. (Rachel bends down to Emma and Ross looks over his shoulder again,
Nighty-night!|Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
Thanks for dinner.|I thought you paid.  Ha, guess we won’t be going back there!
What are you doing?|Oh, anything yet?
Uh!|You don't wanna win the lottery?
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.� Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.� Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
Ok.|Ok. Hold on.  Oh, how hard it is to make an ice sculpture?
I can't say, I just thought it was really good… and… maybe would be worth something some day.|You really thought "Science Boy" was worth saving!
What's wrong?|I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
Yeah, where were you!|Yeah. That's me!
Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!|3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right.I'm sorry, good luck!|Stopping you from marrying the wrong man and making the biggest mistake of your life.
All right.|Really?� You're gonna be okay?
All right. What's your news, Amy?|Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.
Okay. Give me sixty seconds on the clock please... Ready, GO!|Where?
I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart...|Sandy, that's exactly what it is...
Yeah.|Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
I'm still looking through mine...|Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
I don't know.� He was cute, and he liked me.� It was an impulse.|What about Ross?� What about your moment?� Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
I have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.|Oh yeah!
Space cowboy!|Correct! What is Chandler Bing’s job?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?
I am sooo drunk.|Soo... you girls having fun?
Oh, I like my job.|I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!
Hey!|Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
Hey hey hey! Don't mind if I do!|I'm sorry sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention
Jack, look at this.|No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us  We've been complaining the longest!
Hi!|Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
She is good!|Huh, I took a shot there.
Yeah! You bet roomy!|What are you talking about?
Alright, lo�look. I don�t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it�s fine.  So you all smoke then? That�s almost rude, that I�m not.|That�s not true. If you don�t wanna smoke �
Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!  "Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."|Morning!
Honey, that's gorgeous!|You know, the baby can't read, Mike!
Thats not how you see me, is it?|Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table>  she'd have to give her up.
Me too. Come here.|I just don't want to be alone tonight.
Morning.|Hey!
So bad.|go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
Nighty-night!|No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
I’m sorry, for the last time, why aren’t you two together again?  No, I know. I know, because you’re not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.|It’s…it’s complicated okay?
Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.|That's the door. He's gone...
Why are you wearing my apron?|I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
You smoked!|No! I just happened t�do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.
|Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
Groomsman, groomsman, why are you just standing there, where is your bridesmaid?  Oh, that's me.|I love you too.
What’s going on?|We’re moving to Tulsa!
Previously on Friends...|How is that gonna happen?
So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.|
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!
No, Lennart doesn't wait!|Look at that: still in character, I like it… I plant seeds I can't explain.
Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.|I like that poster!
Oh, hey, my pleasure.  So what are your intentions with my Phoebe?|I intend to marry her.
But now she'll never know how he feels!|Yeah, you are!
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?|Nope...
You're a pig. And you can't do this.|Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!
Ewww, is that what that is?|Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
You're welcome. And thank you for "Science Boy". I learned a lot from him|You're welcome.
Oh, I'm sorry honey, you know, but when she said "sex" I wasn't thinking about "sex with you"!|Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?
what, how do we know, we never slept with you.|and who's fault is that.
Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these|Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
Gotcha.|Did somebody sign your bra?
Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?|Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
I understand...|Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
Ross...|I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
Ok, hey Rach?|I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
Good job.|For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
What?|Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!
Oh, I know... I still have my old key!  We can just unlock the door.|Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
Bye.|No! No, of course not. No. That’s why I brought it up.  They didn’t have any sodas?
I don’t know. Phoebe, if one of us saw Mike with another woman would you want us to tell you?|Why? Who’d you seen him with?
Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!|Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!|How about those fries though, huh?
What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.|All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick|Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
Wh-what's going on?|And that horrible museum tour!
Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.|Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
I'm on it!|Anything?
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|I know there'll be other houses, but it's just so... I love that one so much.
Other wall, people! Other wall!|I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
Oh, is that you?|No!
What?|She’s doing it Look, she’s breast-feeding look!
This is like figure skating team all over again.  Help me!|FOOTBALL!
Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?|I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!
Nice to meet you.|H-Hi!! And you are...?
Oh God!|Great. I feel like an idiot.
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.|It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.
What are you doing?|Hey!
Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.|Me too!
So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...|Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.
Hey...|Hey!
Yeah, he's done some amazing works.|Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.
So? Congratulations you two, I didn’t even know you got married.|Oh we-we didn’t.
Bye, see ya.|Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Hi.
Watch.  Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.|Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm...  "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!
What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?|Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this?  Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
I know, that’s why I said again!|Alright you guys, we can’t turn on each other, Okay?  That’s just what she wants.
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!|I’ll tell you about it later. Be cool.
Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.|Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
|Eh, you got a spray-on tan?
Oooohh that’s interesting.|Monica categorizes her towels. How many categories are there?
Oh my God!|Wow, you look unbelievable.
Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.|Really!
I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young...|YES! Sandy you're hired.
|You don�t need a shower.
That’s funny, this conversation’s how I got the bullet hole in my head.|I don’t feel good right now.
Hey!|18th and East End.
Well, the club lost it's power.|What do you think?
Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.|I just want you to know.. Last night.. I'll never forget it.
Yeah, we're gonna let you be alone.|We're getting the house.  We're getting the house.
Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 'Cause my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.|What... What...
This is nice.|I know!
Some girl...!?|She hot?
Tips not included.|Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
Well it's okay. Chandler is talking to her.|Yeah!
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|I'm thinking about you...
Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.|Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
Rach, you sure you wanna do this?|Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... it’s just a little weird, it’s you, and it’s me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.
Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.|And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I�m not t�not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys!  Judy! Bye.|Oh thank god, if Phoebe�s going, can we please take Emma home?
Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word "puppy." Okay, so he said: "If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass."|I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!|Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off.  Not you guys. You got it going on!
Oh, wait a minute it’s not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!|Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
Hi!|Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
|I'll do it!
So, Saturday night!|I'd love to!
Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.|Look at them! Aw. I love you so much.  Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture.|Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. <throws hands out in the air>
Yay.|Uh, Rach, hang on.
If you have the time, I'd really appreciate the help.|Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like "Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!
Of course, I'd be honored!|Thank you!
Oh, I hear divorce bells.|O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.
Hey, here you go.|No reason.
Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this...  Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...|I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?
God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.|Pie eating contest?
What are you guys doing?|Jumping on the bed?
Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm"!|No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.
This kitty is Mittens and this one is Fitzhugh, and this little guy in the cat condo is Jinkies.|Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.|Okay, okay, okay!  You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on "action!" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle.
There are no tickets on the nightstand!|Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
Oooohh that’s interesting.|If you win, we give up the birds.
Hey, y’know what? I’m not waiting! I’m gonna push this baby out! I’m doing it! I mean it’s what? Three centimeters? That’s gotta be like this!|Actually it’s more like this.
No it's just tiring having to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died. I'll see you tomorrow.|Does seem pretty perfect.
what a great dinner.|yeah and hey thanks again for letting me having that last piece of cake at the restaurant.
Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day.|He just left.
I know.|Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.
Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.|Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.|Ah. All right. But my French was good?
Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?|I'm cold!
I would get a room with this cake. I think I could show this cake a good time!|If you had to, what would you give up, food or sex?
<laughs> Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.|Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, <shakes head no> not the same thing.
Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.|New York is awesome!
Oh, I hear divorce bells.|I have a gun
Just flip!|Ha, tails!
Don't look at me I never get his jokes.|No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.
You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.|Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.
Isn’t she beautiful?|Look at her, my first grandchild.
I tried, but apparantly singing "I will survive" in a helium voice - not helping.|Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.
What, what, wait a minute! You haven�t even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like|Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?|No. I can't be away from you for that long.
So now what do we do?|Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Hi Ross.
What is wrong with raising a kid in the city? I'm doing it, Ross is doing it, Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!|...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
You know sometimes your words... they hurt.|Bye bye Mike!/Cya mike!/Bye mike!/Bye bye now!
Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by|oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
Nothing, huh?|No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
Bye, see ya.|Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.
Wh-what's going on?|And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!
Guys, the drawing is about to start!|You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress.|I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.
Oh, mon Dieu!|Oh, de fuff!
Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.|Thank you, I think so too.
What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?|Oh my God. You and Rachel?
Oh wow, it's so beautiful...|Got ya.
Okay, shoot!|Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
Excuse me?|What's with the kissing?
"I need an answer now!"|"Alright, here, you want an answer… the answer… is…"
It was great.|
I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two  are on your own.|Hey Janice!
What are you doing?|You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Wher-where have you been?|Huh-huh, they already know it.
I'm gonna go.|Why??
You cried yesterday at the six o'clock news.|No, no, no, no!
I really wanna have a baby.|Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
What?|Why not?
She did?|You got it!
Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?|Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!
And I can even understand that you couldn’t tell Rachel, but why couldn’t you tell me, huh? You had all day to and you didn’t.|I know I should’ve.  "I’m sorry."
Guess what? You're almost an uncle!|Oh my God!
Maybe we finish this for him!  "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!|Alright, let's go!
What?|Still, he had to find out sometime.
Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.|You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!|Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!
So do you think that my dream means anything?|I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?|What's wrong?
No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.|What is it...?
Yeah. So don't move, okay? Just stay here and...  maybe close your blinds at night.|They passed. They said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.
No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.|I know, what are we gonna do?
Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said  "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I don’t need that kind of talk in my house!|Well Joey, uhm look, I know that she’s difficult, but I think it’s really good that she’s here.
How do you even know a woman like that?|What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"?  No? Divorce?|So, why is Erica coming to visit?
Oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.|Come here, I'll make you a drink.
Oh my God!|I knew it!
Ha, oh, of course.|Thank you.
: how do you know I have one of those?|no that's just where you were going I just figured that I'd help you out, you don't seem like the kind of guy that does this very a lot.
Joey, this is Al T. Booker,  I wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her at the Westside chapel, tomorrow at ten. Hope you can make it.|Estelle?
Ya know, I'm going to take off.|So soon?
Here we go!|Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she’s here.
What? What?|Oh... Bye guys.
That was a test and you just failed.|Damn it! Rookie mistake!
No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!|Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
I got you something from Vermont!|That's weird...it's empty!
Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?|Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.

Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.|Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
Well, do you think I should propose?|Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!
Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!|Oh my god, I am losing my mind.
Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!|So? What do you think of the house?
Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is|No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind
Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.|Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
Okay, then I'm Swedish...|So, what's your name?
That's how old you are.|Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
Of course, I'd be honored!|U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.
I think she looks cute.  ... but I am wrong!|Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?
Good morning everyone, it�s nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions?  Yes, Ken is it?|That�s right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?
Joey's bare ass!|I love you Phoebe.
You still don't know my name, do you?|
