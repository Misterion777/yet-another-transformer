There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!|C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!|All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!|Wait, does he eat chalk?
There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!|Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.|Sounds like a date to me.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.|Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.|Instead of...?
That's right.|Never had that dream.
That's right.|No.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.|And they weren't looking at you before?!
Hi.|This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
Hi.|Are you okay, sweetie?
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...|Cookie?
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...|Carol moved her stuff out today.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...|Ohh.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...|Let me get you some coffee.
Thanks.|Ooh! Oh!
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?|Fine!  Be murky!
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.|No you don't.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!|And you never knew she was a lesbian...
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?|Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.|Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?
Sorry.|Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
Sorry.|Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!|And I just want a million dollars!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!|Rachel?!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!|Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!|Can I get you some coffee?
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!|This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!|Hi, sure!
Hi.|So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Hi.|Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
Hi.|Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
Hi.|Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.|Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.|I'll have whatever Christine is having.

Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.|Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.|I say push her down the stairs.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.|Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.|C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.|You can see where he'd have trouble.
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.|Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...|Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...|bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...|I'm all better now.
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...|I helped!
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.|And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!|What, like there's a rule or something?
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!|Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!|It's, uh, it's Paul.
Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!|Who's Paul?
Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!|Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?|He finally asked you out?
Yes!|Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...|Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?|That'd be good...
Really?|No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Really?|What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.|Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.|I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...|A wandering?
Monicage!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.|Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Monicage!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.|Hey, Paul!
Monicage!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.|Yeah?
Monicage!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.|Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
Shut up, Joey!|So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
Shut up, Joey!|Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
Shut up, Joey!|Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
Shut up, Joey!|Yes, and we're very excited about it.
Shut up, Joey!|Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.
Shut up, Joey!|Okay, sure.
Shut up, Joey!|Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
Shut up, Joey!|Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.|I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.|It's a beautiful thing.
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.|What's this?
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.|I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.|Which goes where?

This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.|Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.|Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.|Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
You guys.|Oh, God.
You guys.|You got screwed.
You guys.|Oh my God!
Oh my God!|I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?|Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
-leg?|That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.|Ooh, steer clear of you.
I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!|Shut up!
I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!|You must stop!
That only took me an hour.|Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...|What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.|Stay out of my freezer!
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...|What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.|Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Isn't there?|Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform.  ...Sexually.|Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
It's okay...|I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Two years.|Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?|...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.|Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?|Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?|Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?|Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.|That is amazing.
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.|Congratulations.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.|If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.|Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.|Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.|Morning. Good morning.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.|Morning.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.|Morning, Paul.
Hello, Paul.|Hi, Paul, is it?
Hello, Paul.|Thank you!  Thank you so much!
Hello, Paul.|Stop!
Hello, Paul.|No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
Hello, Paul.|We'll talk later.
Hello, Paul.|Yeah.
Hello, Paul.|That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
Hello, Paul.|Shut up, and put my table back.
Hello, Paul.|Okayyy!
Hello, Paul.|All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
So, like, you guys all have jobs?|Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
So, like, you guys all have jobs?|Yeah, I'm an actor.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?|I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?|Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?|Look, it was a job all right?
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?|'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?|I will not take this abuse.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?|You're right, I'm sorry.  "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?|You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler?
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?|So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.|I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Oh, yeah.|Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.|Big time!
Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.|I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Oh, look, wish me luck!|What for?
Hey, Monica!|Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
You had sex, didn't you?|How do you do that?
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?|You know Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.|You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Of course it was a line!|Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
Of course it was a line!|I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
Of course it was a line!|I hate men!  I hate men!
Of course it was a line!|Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
Of course it was a line!|Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
Of course it was a line!|All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
Of course it was a line!|I just thought he was nice, y'know?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|Guess what?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|You got a job?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|Oh, how well you know me...
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|How'd you pay for them?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|Uh, credit card.
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|And who pays for that?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|Um... my... father.
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.|C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.|Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Thank you.|You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
Thank you.|The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
Thank you.|All right, you ready?
No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!|You can, I know you can!
I don't think so.|Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!
I don't think so.|C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
I don't think so.|Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...|Rachel!  That was a library card!
Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...|Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...|Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...|Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?|No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
You be okay?|Yeah.
You be okay?|Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.|Goodnight.

That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.|I knew.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.|You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.|I did.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.|Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.|Yeah, maybe...
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.|Okay... okay, maybe I will...

Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.|Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.|I'm just serving it.

What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.|Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.|Oh, yeah!
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.|Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Absolutely.|Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
Absolutely.|Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
Absolutely.|The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
Absolutely.|Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
Absolutely.|....Are we still talking about sex?
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?|Well, she has issues.
Does she.|He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?|Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
No. No.|Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Hi.|So.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.|Sorry. You look good too.
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...|A lesbian?
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?|Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
Why- why are you here, Carol?|I'm pregnant.
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.|...Then I've already seen this one!
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.|Are you through with that?
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.|Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.|Whose little ball of paper is this?!
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.|She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.|Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.|Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.|Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.|That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!|What?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|Eeaagh!
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|Yeah, it's beautiful.
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|No, look, don't touch that!
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|Oh! Yeah!
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?

Boys? We're going in.|W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
Boys? We're going in.|Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?|Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?|Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?|She is so great! I miss her.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?|What does she mean by 'involved'?
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.|Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.|So what are you gonna do?
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.|I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.|.....Well, this is still ruined, right?
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?|Curry.
Mmmm!|I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
Mmmm!|Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
They all had a thing for him.|Aw, Mom...
They all had a thing for him.|I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-|No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Well, they don't have to know that...|Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Well, they don't have to know that...|Yeah.
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.|I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.|I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...|What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.|No it's not.
Nothing! It's an expression.|Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.|No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.|Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.|And you knew about this?!
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Must pee.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|You're twins?
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|What does she do?
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|She's a waitress.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.

Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Oh.. a little..
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Mm-hmm..
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|A lot.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Mm.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Got me.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Remember when we were in high school together?
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Yeah.
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?

Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Me either...
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.|Hi.
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.|Ross, you remember Susan.
How could I forget?|Ross.
Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?|Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-|She.
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?|Yes, and she's very supportive.
Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh.|Thanks.
Quack, quack..|Ross? That opens my cervix.
Barry?|C'mon in.
Are you sure?|Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
Are you sure?|Huh?!
Are you sure?|So, how ya doin?

I dumped him.|Okay.
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?|Give me a 'for instance'.
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?|Marlon-
Marlon?!|-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
...As in Mouse?|As in my grandmother.
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?|Julia..
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?|We agreed on Minnie.
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?|Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Oh, that's great.|Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.|Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.|Me?!
No!  I went with Mindy.|Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.|Oh! Well, um..  You've got plugs!
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.|And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.|Okay..
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.|Wow.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.|What?
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.|Me.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.|Anyway, um,  I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
Well, thank you for giving it back.|Hello?!
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?|Helen Geller? I don't think so.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?|Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?|Thank you!
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?|No, I mean it's not Geller.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?|What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?|No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?|Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
It's my baby too.|Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!|All right, you two, stop it!
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!|No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!|Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!|Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!|My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!|Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!|Yeah. Yeah. A little.
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!|Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back..
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!|You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!|Oh my God.
Look at that.|I know.
Well? Isn't that amazing?|What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Well? Isn't that amazing?|I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
Well? Isn't that amazing?|You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
Then don't do that, alright?|Okay!
Monica. Whaddya think?|Mm-hmm.
Wh- are you welling up?|No.
You are, you're welling up.|Am not!
You're gonna be an aunt.|Oh shut up!
You're gonna be an aunt.|Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
Hi guys!|Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Hi guys!|Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'|Ohh. Ouch.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'|What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'|Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'|Since when?
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'|Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'|Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.|And everybody knows this?
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.|Yeah. Cushions the blow.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.|Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.|That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.|Uh, Ross.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.|What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"|"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Hey, that was really good!|Thanks! Let's keep going.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"|"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.|What?
Not so much!|Whoah!
Hey!|Hey!
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.|No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.|Y'miss it?
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.|That's ridiculous!
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.|Can I use.. either thumb?
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.|Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.|Yeah. Yeah, excellent.
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.|Good for me!
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.|Y'okay, Phoebe?
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.|Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
What did they do to you?|It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
What did they do to you?|Easy.
What did they do to you?|- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
What did they do to you?|Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
What did they do to you?|Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
What did they do to you?|What are you talking about? Keep it!
What did they do to you?|It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
What did they do to you?|Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
What did they do to you?|Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
We're with you. We got it.|Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
We're with you. We got it.|Chandler, what are you doing?
Hey. Whaddya doing?|Oh! Oh, God!
Hey. Whaddya doing?|What is this?!
Hey. Whaddya doing?|I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
Hey. Whaddya doing?|Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
Hey. Whaddya doing?|And this- is my reward!
Hey. Whaddya doing?|Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
Hey. Whaddya doing?|Okay, so this time I won't quit!
Hey. Whaddya doing?|Ohhh! Put it out!
Hey. Whaddya doing?|All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out.
Hey. Whaddya doing?|Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.|This Alan again? How's it goin'?
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.|So when do we get to meet the guy?
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.|Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.|What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.|Well, then can we meet him?
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.|Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.|Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Let it go, Ross.|Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
Let it go, Ross.|Do you all promise?
Let it go, Ross.|Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
Let it go, Ross.|Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!|Hey, Pheebs.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!|'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!|What bank is this?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!|Hey. It's him.  Who is it?
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!|It's Alan.
Chandler! He's here!|Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
Chandler! He's here!|Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
Chandler! He's here!|Hi.
Chandler! He's here!|Hi, Alan.
Chandler! He's here!|I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
C'mon!|...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
C'mon!|Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|Yeah!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|And did you notice...?
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|Yeah.
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|...What shoe?
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
Really!|Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
Really!|You know what I like most about him, though?
Really!|What?
Really!|The way he makes me feel about myself.
Really!|Yeah...
Hi.. how was the game?|Well..
Hi.. how was the game?|WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?|Alan.
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?|He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?|I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?|Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..|What?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?|Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?|Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
..I dunno, a little too Alan?|I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
Hey, Lizzie.|Hey, Weird Girl.
I brought you alphabet soup.|Did you pick out the vowels?
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.|Saltines?
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?|What?  Oh my God, there's really money in here.
I know.|Weird Girl, what are you doing?
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.|No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Oh, that's fine, no.|Would you like my tin-foil hat?
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.|Please, let me do something.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?|Okay.
Keep the change.  Sure you don't wanna pretzel?|No, I'm fine.
See ya.|Huh!
A thumb?!|Eww!
A thumb?!|I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
A thumb?!|Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
A thumb?!|Does, um, anyone wanna see?
A thumb?!|Nooo!
A thumb?!|Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!
A thumb?!|It's worse than the thumb!
A thumb?!|Hey, this is so unfair!
A thumb?!|Oh, why is it unfair?
A thumb?!|So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
A thumb?!|...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
A thumb?!|Well, I-I could live without it.
A thumb?!|Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.|Oh,  "you do, do you"?
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.|"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.|Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.|Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?|No.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.|Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.|Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!

So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?|Alright, c'mon!  Let's play Twister!
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.|What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.|He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
Look, it's just a little more complicated...|Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?

Green. To the green.|Ohhh... I'm fine.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.|Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.|Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.|We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.|Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.

Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.|Multiple orgasms!
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!|No plans, huh?
Not a one.|Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Oh, right, right, shut up.|Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.|Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.|You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|Tony?
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|Does anybody want anything else?
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|That guy, he burns me up.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Hi, Joey.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|My god, Angela.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Are you gonna go over there?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Joey.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|You look good.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|You don't say.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Who?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Sure.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|What?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|We're just friends.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|What four of us?
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.|Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...|Oh, god help us.
What?|Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.|What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.|Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.|It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Nuh-uh.|Yuh-huh.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?|Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
No.|Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.|There you go.
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?|Yep.
Which?|Which what?
You've never met Bob, have you?|No, but he's...
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...|Hey, Joey.
Where are they? Where are they?|This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.|Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Here we go.|Ok, have a good break-up.
Hey, Janice.|Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?|We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
What?|What?
What... did you get me there?|I got you...these.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.|Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?|No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's it?|Yeah, it was really hard.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.|Ok, you weren't there.
Comin' through. Move, move.|Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.|But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.|What?
No suds, no save. Ok?|What's goin' on?
No suds, no save. Ok?|Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
No suds, no save. Ok?|Was your basket on top?
No suds, no save. Ok?|Yeah, but, there were no suds.
No suds, no save. Ok?|So?
No suds, no save. Ok?|Well, you know, no suds, no save.
No suds, no save. Ok?|No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Ok, let's do laundry.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|What's that?
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Rach, have you never done this before?
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
So, where did you guys grow up?|Brooklyn Heights.
So, where did you guys grow up?|Cleveland.
How, how did that happen?|Oh my god.
What?|I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
So, you and Angela, huh?|Yep. Pretty much.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.|Huh, I never really noticed.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.|Monica, Monica is great.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.|Yeah, isn't he?
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.|You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.|Huh. That's nice.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.|Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.|All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.|That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?|Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross, what's the matter?|Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Come on, show me.|All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Oh, everything's pink.|Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Oh my god.|What?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.|Come on, they're close.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.|Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?|Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?|All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Oh!|Ow!
I'm outta here.|Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Really?|Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.|Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.|Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?|Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.|Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
Oh, I don't know, a million?|Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
I'm fine.|All right.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.|Wait here. Breathe.
How do you do that?|It's like a gift.
We should always always break up together.|Oh, I'd like that.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|Let go!
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|Yes! Did you see that?
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.|I could not have done this without you.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.|Are you sure?
Oh, are you sure you're ok?|Yeah.
Does it still hurt?|Yeah.
Does it still hurt?|What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
Does it still hurt?|Hi.
Does it still hurt?|Hey, how'd it go?
Does it still hurt?|Excellent.
Does it still hurt?|We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
Does it still hurt?|What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
Does it still hurt?|Oh, I'm sorry.
Where's Chandler?|Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Where's Chandler?|I'm free! I'm free!
Where's Chandler?|That oughta do it.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!|You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!|The exclamation point in the title scares me.  Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!

God. I feel violated.|Ross, ten o'clock.
God. I feel violated.|Is it? Feels like two.
God. I feel violated.|No, ten o'clock.
God. I feel violated.|What?
God. I feel violated.|There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
God. I feel violated.|Oh. Hel-lo!
God. I feel violated.|She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
God. I feel violated.|Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
God. I feel violated.|Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|Thank you, buddy.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.

Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|Y'think?
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|Yeah!

Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|Yes, you said that.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|Chandler?

Hey, kids.|Hey.
Hey, kids.|No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.|Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...|...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.|...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?|'We' would be me and Rick.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?|Who's Rick?
Who's Rick?|My husband.
Who's Rick?|Ooooohhh.
Oh, so you're divorced?|No.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?|No, I'm still married.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?|Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?|Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?|What?!
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?|I suppose mainly sexual.
...Hm.|Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?|Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|I couldn't do it.
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|Good for you, Joey.
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|Yeah! C'mon!
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
Tah-daaah!|Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.|Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Well, whaddya think?|Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
Well, whaddya think?|...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
Well, whaddya think?|Uh-oh...
Well, whaddya think?|How-how did that happen?
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|You guys, I am not that bad!
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know,  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|That is so unfair!
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|Why not?
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|I could do that.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.|Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.|Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...

Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.|Well, what's the part?
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.|Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"

Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.|Thank you!
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.|Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!|C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!
I warned you...|Who is being loud?
I warned you...|Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?|Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?|Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?|No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door?
Okay, everybody ready?|Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.|Me?
That would work.|Right. Okay. Losing the robe.  And the robe is lost.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?|Well, I'm- I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.|Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?|I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
God, I love these fingers...|Thank you.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.|
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..|Okay.
Don't go.|Okay. Oh no, I have to.
Too bad, she's leaving.|I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.|It's not Rick.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!|No, it's-it's Andrew.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?|He's... new.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?|No, that's not exactly what I was..
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.|So what do you want?
You.|You have me!
Nono, just you.|Whaddyou mean?
Lose the other guys.|...Like, ...all of them?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?|Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'|So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...|Which one?
...The second guy.|Well, call me if you change your mind.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?|Hey!
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?|Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?|Nope.
No? What happened, big guy?|"Big guy?"
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.|I got fired.
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.|Oh!
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.|Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.|Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.|My mom will.
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.|Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.|Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.|Maybe this wasn't your shot.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|Hard to tell, I was naked.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|Yeah? That's so nice!
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|Night.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|Uh-huh!
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever.
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.|Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go.  OK, thank you very much.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!|Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, you guys, this is big.|
Wow, you guys, this is big.|Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?
Wow, you guys, this is big.|Well, I never call me.
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.|Hi Mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!|Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.|I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Hi everyone.|And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.|Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.|That had to hurt!
You're definitely scaring here.|

I have no idea what you just said.|I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
I have no idea what you just said.|
I have no idea what you just said.|Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
Alright, somebody.|OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Alright, somebody.|Whoooaa!
Alright, somebody.|That's my sister.
Alright, somebody.|OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
Alright, somebody.|Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
Alright, somebody.|Pheebs, what about you?
Alright, somebody.|Oh... Milwaukee.
Um... Ross?|Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
Um... Ross?|No way!
Um... Ross?|The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
Um... Ross?|Oh, Rachel.
Oh come on, I already went.|You did not go!
Oh come on, I already went.|Come on.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.|Step back.
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.|We have a winner!
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.|Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.|Come on.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.|And you didn't marry him because...?
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...|Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Yeah right.|It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
OK.|But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
You don't.|Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Really?|Mmmm.
You do?|I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great.|It's never gonna happen.
Oh Ross, you're so great.|What?
Oh Ross, you're so great.|You and Rachel.
Oh Ross, you're so great.|Why not?
Oh Ross, you're so great.|Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
Oh Ross, you're so great.|No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
Oh Ross, you're so great.|Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
Oh Ross, you're so great.|I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
Oh Ross, you're so great.|Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
Oh Ross, you're so great.|I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?
Oh Ross, you're so great.|Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
Oh Ross, you're so great.|Shhhh!
What are you shushing?|We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?
Ahhhh!|See?
Would you like some gum?|Um, is it sugarless?
Sorry, it's not.|Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
|OK, here goes.
|Are you going to do it?
|I'm going to do it.
|Do you want any help?
|You come out there, you're a dead man.
|Good luck, man.
|Thanks.  OK.
|OK.
|Hey, where are you going?
|Outside.
|You can't go out there.
|Why not?
|Because of... the reason.
|And that would be?
|I, um, can't tell you.
|Joey, what's going on?
|OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
|About what?
|He's planning your birthday party.
|Oh my God! I love him!
|You'd better act surprised.
About what?|My surprise party!
What surprise party?|Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Well, he didn't tell me.|Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.|No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Hmmm... this is so nice.|OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
OK.|OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ohhh!!!!|Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh, look at the little cat!|What?  Ow!
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.|Sorry, that was wax.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.|Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.|Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.|During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.|Yeah?
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?|Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?|Er, yeah, it's mine.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?|Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Wait a minute. What's his name?|Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Wait a minute. What's his name?|Bob Buttons?
Wait a minute. What's his name?|Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
Oooh! You are a very bad man!|You owe me a cat.
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...|
Lucky sixes....|Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
Lucky sixes....|Hi!
Lucky sixes....|And Joey....
Lucky sixes....|Hi!
Lucky sixes....|And Ross.
Lucky sixes....|Hi!
Lucky sixes....|
Lucky sixes....|He doesn't speak much English.
Lucky sixes....|Monopoly!
Lucky sixes....|Look at that!
So, um... where did Paolo come from?|Oh... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.|Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.|Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.|Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.|Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.|Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.|
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.|You betcha!
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.|Are you alright?
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.|My God, you're choking!  That better?
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....|Perfection?
|Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
|Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
|I have absolutely no idea.
|That's... that's classic.
|Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
|If you want, I'll do it.
|I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip.  But I won't.
|God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
|You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
|Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
Paolo. Hi.|Ross!
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.|Thing?
Thing, yes. Thing.|Ah, you... have the sex?
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...|Bed?
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.|Oh!
Yeah! Se vice?|Si.
So you do know a little English.|Poco... a leetle.
Do you know the word crapweasel?|No.
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.|OK.
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...|Thank you.
Thanks.|Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Thanks.|Bwah-hah-hah!
Thanks.|OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
Thanks.|Oh.. oh... oh.
Thanks.|Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
Well, this has been fun.|Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.|Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Hey gorgeous, how's it going?|Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.|Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Do you want a date Saturday?|Yes please.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-|He's a he?
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?|Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
You did?|Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?|I did.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?|Yeah, I think so, yeah.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?|Not me.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?|Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?|No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?|I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?|Yeah! Right!
WHAT IS IT?!|Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
WHAT IS IT?!|Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.|Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.|Oh my God! Calling from Rome!  Bon giorno, caro mio.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.|So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.|Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.|Hey dad, what's up?  Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
So, uh, how's she doing?|The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
So, uh, how's she doing?|How-how are you, Mom?
So, uh, how's she doing?|Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?
So, uh, how's she doing?|What?
So, uh, how's she doing?|What's different?
So, uh, how's she doing?|Nothing.
So, uh, how's she doing?|Oh, maybe that's it.
So, uh, how's she doing?|She is unbelievable, our mother is...
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.|Oh God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.|Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.|Not just restaurants, from our house.
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.|Mrs. Geller?
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.|She looks so small.
I know.|Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
G'bye, Nana.|Bye, Nana.
Ross!|What is going on?!
Ross!|Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
Ross!|What?
Ross!|She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
Ross!|What's going on?
Ross!|She may have died.
Ross!|She may have died?
Ross!|We're looking into it.
Ross!|I, uh, I'll go see.
Ross!|This almost never happens!
Ross!|Now she's passed.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|So, um, did she...
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Twice.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Twice?
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Oh, that sucks!
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|You guys okay?
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Nono, she's gone.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|We checked. A lot.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?  Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Thanks!
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.|Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.|Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
I was just thinking. When my time comes-|Dad!
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.|You what?
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.|Define fun.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...|...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.|That's probably what they'll say.
Hey, gorgeous.|Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.|Oh! Okay! Phew!
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?|I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
...Quality, right, great.|Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?|What? He's cute!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.|Is Brian...?
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.|Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
This one?|No.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.|You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.|You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.|Wait! We need shoes!
Okay. Um, how about these?|That's really a day shoe.
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?|Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.|No, it really should be burgundy.
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.|Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
Oh my God..|Is everything all right, dear?
How we doing, you guys ready?|Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Some days it's all I can think about.|Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
Some days it's all I can think about.|Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
Some days it's all I can think about.|What'd I say?
Some days it's all I can think about.|Hm-m.
Some days it's all I can think about.|Are these the shoes?
Some days it's all I can think about.|Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?|Morning. We ready to go?
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?|Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
It was a really beautiful service.|It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart.  Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
It was a really beautiful service.|What?
It was a really beautiful service.|Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
It was a really beautiful service.|Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
It was a really beautiful service.|You're watching a football game at a funeral?
It was a really beautiful service.|No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
It was a really beautiful service.|You are a frightening, frightening man.
It was a really beautiful service.|Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
It was a really beautiful service.|Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
It was a really beautiful service.|God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
It was a really beautiful service.|I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
It was a really beautiful service.|God! Ross!
It was a really beautiful service.|I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.|What, what is it?
You missed a belt loop.|Oh! No-n-
Okay, it's in spasm.|Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Okay, it's in spasm.|Oh, no-
Okay, it's in spasm.|Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
Okay, it's in spasm.|Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?|I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?|Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?|Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister
Ooh! That's so nice...|...Chandler!
Ooh! That's so nice...|Hey.
Ooh! That's so nice...|And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
Ooh! That's so nice...|
Ooh! That's so nice...|Rachel. Rachel Rachel.  I love you the most.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Oh, well you know who I love the most?
Ooh! That's so nice...|No.
Ooh! That's so nice...|You!
Ooh! That's so nice...|Oh.. you don't get it!
Ooh! That's so nice...|Whaddya got there?
Ooh! That's so nice...|Just a, uh... hearing disability.
Ooh! That's so nice...|What's the score?
Ooh! That's so nice...|Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Beautiful!
Ooh! That's so nice...|Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
Ooh! That's so nice...|Your grandmother would have hated this.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
Ooh! That's so nice...|No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
Ooh! That's so nice...|That sounds like Nana.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
Ooh! That's so nice...|...I can imagine.
Ooh! That's so nice...|I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
Ooh! That's so nice...|That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
Ooh! That's so nice...|Tell her what?
Ooh! That's so nice...|How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
Ooh! That's so nice...|I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
Ooh! That's so nice...|...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Huh.
Ooh! That's so nice...|More wine, dear?
Ooh! That's so nice...|Oh, I think so.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Those earrings look really lovely on you.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Thank you. They're yours.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Actually they were Nana's.
Ooh! That's so nice...|Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?|That little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.|Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Aww, look at the little thing.|Who are those people?
Aww, look at the little thing.|Got me.
Aww, look at the little thing.|Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?|Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?|Looks like a fun gang.
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?|Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?|Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
Hey, Lowell.|Hey, Chandler.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?|It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.|I know. That's what I told her.
Really.|Yeah.
So- you can tell?|Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
So you don't think I have a, a quality?|Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
He is?|Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?|An advance?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.|Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?|Huh?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|No, they're not.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.

Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|What were you modeling for?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|You know those posters for the city free clinic?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those "healthy, healthy, healthy guys"?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Do you know which one you're gonna be?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so...
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Thanks.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|You know, they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Yeah.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Yes, every single one of them.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|So you're free Thursday, then.
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Yeah. Oh, can I come?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.|I thought it was $98.50.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.|Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.|Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.|Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?|No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.|What's it look like?
Kinda like a big face without skin.|Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.|Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.|Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?|What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?|Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?|Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Really?|But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Rach, here's your mail.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|No, here's your mail.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Would you just open it?
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|We all chipped in.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|We did?
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|You owe me 20 bucks.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Thank you. Thank you so much!
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|All right, I'm nine years old.
Oh, I hate this story.|We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Oh, I hate this story.|Oh my god.
Oh, I hate this story.|Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.|We did?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?|Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.|Get out.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.|Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?|Nothing.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?|Yeah.  Oh.
What's wrong?|I just remembered, I have to do something.
Oh. What?|Um, leave.
So I guess you all saw it.|Saw what?
So I guess you all saw it.|No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.|Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What?|I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|That's closer.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|Oh, you must stop shooping.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|Chandler, will you just come in already?
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
That's not a question.|But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.|Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Ah!|Ok, Mom never hit.
Ah!|Ok, all done.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!|Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?|Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.|Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.|The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.|The balloon?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.|No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.|I can't, I gotta go.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.|Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.|Almost never.
Got the keys? or Got the keys!|Ok.
Anytime you're ready.|Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.|Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.|Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.|Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.|Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.|No I don't.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."|No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".|Do either of you have the keys?
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".|The oven is on.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!|Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!|Well then get it, get it!
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!|That tone will not make me go any faster.
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!|Joey!
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!|That one will.
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.|Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?|Hi, how's it goin?
Shh!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?|I did.
Does it always, uh--?|No, no that was the first.
Does it always, uh--?|Keep singing! Keep singing!
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.|I felt it!
Nope, not that one.|Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|For an emergency just like this.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|right now. But I'm not.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|I swear you said you had the keys.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Why would I have the keys?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|But I didn't.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Well, you should have.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Why?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Because!
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Why?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Because!
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Well, the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?  Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.|Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
You call that delicious?|Stop it, stop it, stop it!
You call that delicious?|Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
Ooh.|What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.|I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.|Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
Shall I carve?|By all means.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?|I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?|Does anybody wanna split this with me?
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?|Oh, I will.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?|Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?|Make a wish?
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?|Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?|The bigger half.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.|That's so sweet.

My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.|That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.|Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.|Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...|Why don't you just get a roommate?

So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.|I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.|So what are you gonna be?
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.|Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.|Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.|Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.|Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
Yeah, you wish!|It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Yeah, you wish!|Yeah, okay. Alright.
Yeah, you wish!|Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
Yeah, you wish!|Woooo! Yeah!
Yeah, you wish!|Phoebe, you're on.
Oh, oh, good.|Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
|No. No, that's- that's okay.
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!|That guy's going home with a note!
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!|Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
Could you speak up please?|Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Could you speak up please?|Daryl Hannah.
Could you speak up please?|Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a
Could you speak up please?|Hard quality.
Could you speak up please?|-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling.
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.|Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.|Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Just a smidge.|David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
Just a smidge.|I think it's romantic.
Just a smidge.|Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
Just a smidge.|Yeah!
Just a smidge.|Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
Just a smidge.|Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
Just a smidge.|No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
Just a smidge.|Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
Just a smidge.|What?!
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!|I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!|Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!|I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.|Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Nice shoes, huh?|Aah, y'killing me!
Nice shoes, huh?|Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
Nice shoes, huh?|Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
Nice shoes, huh?|Do you always have to bring him here?
Nice shoes, huh?|I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
Nice shoes, huh?|Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
Nice shoes, huh?|Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
Nice shoes, huh?|Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.|Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Yuh.|Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be  yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.|Sure.
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.|Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Rrrreally.|Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
...Now? Now?|Oh yeah, right now.
Okay, okay, okay.|Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
Okay, what the hell, what the hell.  You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?|I can hop.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|Yeah.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|You know more than one Fun Bobby?
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|I happen to know a Fun Bob.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|Okay, here we go...
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|There. Now there is.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.|Uh, four.
Four.|Five.
Five.|Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Five.|Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?|Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.|What's the matter?
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...|That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Really.|Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
What, uh... what juggling thing?|With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
No.|Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
No.|Phoebe. Hi.
No.|Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
No.|No. Have you seen David?
No.|No, no, he hasn't been around.
No.|Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.
No.|Minsk?
No.|Minsk. It's in Russia.
No.|I know where Minsk is.
No.|We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.
No.|So when, when do you leave?
No.|January first.
Hello?|Hey!
Hi.|Hi!  What-what're you doing here?
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so  congratulations! This is so exciting!|It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Oh, you're not going?  Oh, why?|Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
Oh, you're not going?  Oh, why?|Thank you, Max. Thank you.
So-so you're really not going?|I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Oh don't do that.|Please.
Oh no no.|No, but I'm asking-
Oh, but I can't do that-|No, but I can't-
It's your thing, and-|-make the decision-
Okay, um, stay.|Stay.
Getting so good at that!|It was Max's stuff.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|You remember Janice.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Vividly.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Hi.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Hi, I'm Sandy.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Yeah. That's okay, right?
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Par-tay!
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|That thing is not coming in here.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Alright. Just keep him away from me.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Thank you.  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|And then... your face is bloated?
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.|Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Yeah.|Hey, kids...
Yeah.|Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
Yeah.|There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!
Yeah.|But you found me!
Yeah.|Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! You're on Janice Camera!
Yeah.|Kill me. Kill me now.
Yeah.|Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
Yeah.|Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!
Yeah.|Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Oh, no. Oh, no.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|I'm sorry you misunderstood...
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Oh, will you give me the thing.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Hi, Max!
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Yoko.  I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Wow.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Are you alright?
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|You're going to Minsk.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|No, I'm... not going to Minsk.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say  'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Uh, ow.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me.  And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|I'll never forget you.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it.  I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|There y'go, kids.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|You seen Sandy?
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|What?
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|The bll is drrbing!
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|And the moment of joy is upon us.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|I can't kiss anyone.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|So I'm kissing everyone?
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Alrightalrightalright.  There.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.|...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?|Why?
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.|Oh my God.  Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.|He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.|Nice hat.
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.|Thanks.
We should do something. Whistle.|We are not going to whistle.
Come on, do it.|No!
Do it!|No!
Do it do it do it!|Woo-woo!
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?|I just wish there was something we could do.  Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Phoebe, what are you doing?|Maybe nobody's tried this.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.|Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!|Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
I wish all guys could be like him.|I know.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?|He doesn't have anyone.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?|Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?|I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?|Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up!
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?|Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.|No way, forget it.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.|C'mon, she's your mom!
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?|Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'|C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
You can say that because she's not your mom.|Oh, please...
You can say that because she's not your mom.|Bona sera.
You can say that because she's not your mom.|Oh, hi sweetie.
You can say that because she's not your mom.|When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
You can say that because she's not your mom.|Last night.
You can say that because she's not your mom.|Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
You can say that because she's not your mom.|Hey hey hey! She's on!
You can say that because she's not your mom.|Ah! Nora Bing!
You can say that because she's not your mom.|...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
You can say that because she's not your mom.|Your mom was arrested?
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.|...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?|Shhh.
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?|...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!|Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!|Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!|Awww!
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.|Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.|Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.|Nah... not-not special enough.
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?|Waaay too special.
I am famished. What do I want...|Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?|Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?|What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.|I know I am.
Who's doing shots?|Yeah.
Who's doing shots?|I'm in.
There y'go. Ross?|Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
There y'go. Ross?|Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
There y'go. Ross?|...But a man can change.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?|Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?|Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?|Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
You okay there, slugger?|Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
What is with you tonight?|Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.|No. It's the one he's licking.
She's supposed to be with you.|You're good.
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?|The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.|When?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.|The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
No, it's you!|Please.
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...|Right.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.|Uh-oh...
You are gonna be fine, believe me.|Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
Hey, is Chandler here?|Yeah.
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?|Right. No big deal.
Okay.|In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
What code?|You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
What code?|What are you guys doing out here?
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.|Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.|Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.|Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.|Ross, how could you let this happen?

Well... not in the same way...|I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...|Hey.

How would I know? I-I wasn't here.|Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Oh my God.|You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?|Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
What?|I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
You knew about this?|Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!|Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!|Thanks, man, big help.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?|I wasn't- I mean, I-
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.|I know-
I can't believe you did this.|Chandler-
I can't believe you did this.|Me neither, y'know what-
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.|What are you mad at me for?!
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.|Chandler-
You gotta let me slam the door!|See what happens when you break the code?
You gotta let me slam the door!|Joey-

Hey.|Hey.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.|Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.|Hey Rach.
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.|Hey.
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.|Hello.
Hello.|Going to the hospital tonight?
No, you?|No, you?
You just asked me.|Okay, maybe it was a trick question.  Um, Rachel can we do this now?
You just asked me.|Okay.  I am so hot!
You just asked me.|Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
You just asked me.|I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
You just asked me.|C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
You just asked me.|Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
You just asked me.|Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me.
You just asked me.|Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
You just asked me.|What was that?
You just asked me.|Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
You just asked me.|Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser?
You just asked me.|I'll shut up.
You just asked me.|Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
You just asked me.|Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
You just asked me.|Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
You just asked me.|Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
You just asked me.|We're rehearsing a Greek play.
You just asked me.|That's very funny. We done now?
You just asked me.|No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
You just asked me.|That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
You just asked me.|Okay, 'you' can't, or  Still doing the play. Aaah!
Alright, whadyou do with him?|Oh! You're awake!
Look at you! How, how do you feel?|Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
Look at you! How, how do you feel?|You look good!
Look at you! How, how do you feel?|I feel good! ...Who are you?
Look at you! How, how do you feel?|Oh, sorry.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.|I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Well, we both have.|So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Well, actually it's just from me.|I got you the foot massager.
You know who shaved you? That was me.|I read to you.
I sang.  Hah!|Well,... thanks.
I sang.  Hah!|Oh, my pleasure.
You're welcome.|So. I guess I'll see you around.
What, that's it?|"See you around?"
What, that's it?|Well, what do you want me to say?
What, that's it?|Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"
What, that's it?|Alright, I'll call you.
I don't think you mean that.|This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?|No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.|You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.|Really stupid.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?|Yeah. No. No...
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.|Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
You're kidding.|No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Wow!|Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"|That makes more sense.
So, what's going on now?|I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!
Whaddya see?|Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Whaddya see?|You okay, kiddo?
Whaddya see?|Yeah, okay.
Whaddya see?|Alright.
Whaddya see?|Nice save.
Mrs. Bing.|Mr. Geller.
Mrs. Bing.|Hey.
You mean that?|Yeah, why not.  So I told her.
Yeah? How'd it go?|Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Well, howdya feel?|Pretty good! I told her.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.|What's a 'niffle'?
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.|You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...|Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!|Nooo!
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna.  Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.|Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna.  Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.|Yup!

Yeah, that's a big step.|...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration?  I could call immigration!
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...|Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Need a new table.|You think?
Hey hey, come on in!|Hey, hello! mmwa!  I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.

Well, thanks for the books.|All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
Hello?|
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?|That's the rule.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!|How'd you get to that?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio|You knew about that?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.|Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?|Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that?|Why not?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?|Why, are you moving out?
I'm not moving out.|You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...|Aw, I know all about Kip!

Uma Thurman.|Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
Uma Thurman.|Feminist issue. That's where I went!
She is gonna hate me.|Yeah, well...
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?|That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!|What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."|You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?|Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!|Not like that, I won't!
Hey!|Hi Pheebs!
Are you moving out?|No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?|Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,|Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ok, um,|Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies|All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.|I guess you don't.
So, what do you think?|I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!|So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
I know!|Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
I know!|Heads up Ross!  You suck!
Are you okay?|I need some milk.

I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!|Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!|I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?|I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Such a pig!|Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Oh he's like a...|He's like a big disgusting...
...like a...|...pig...pig man!
Yes, good! Ok...|Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...|Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
The end.|Oh, God...
Should I not have told you?|No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...|We should get over there and see if she's okay.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...|Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...|No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...|Come on, two on one.
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...|What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...|What, now?
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...|Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...|My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
How's it going?|Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
How's it going?|Ooh!
How's it going?|Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
How's it going?|Oh, ok bye-bye.
How's it going?|Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel,  but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
How's it going?|Grazie.
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...|Oh, just look at her...
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...|Oh, you're right.
Hey.|Hey.
You all right?|Ooh, I've been better...
Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.|Oh, Ross...
What?|I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Huh.|Oh Ross, you're so great!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Oh...
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|You ok?
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Yep!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|What?
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|What?
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Yes, you're having a boy!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Wha-
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Wha-
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|What is it?
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Hey!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Hey!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|We already knew that!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|I'm having a son. Um...
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!|Shut-out!!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!|Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!|Yeah, get out!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  and I'm gone.|One more game?
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  and I'm gone.|Oh yeah!
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock|I'm sorry!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!|Rachel, wait, wait.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!|Can I just say one thing?
What? What?!|That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.|That's pretty much it.
Oops!|But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.|Okay. I'll miss you.
Isn't he great?|He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?|So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|Okay.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|Did I, uh, did I miss something?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Huh.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Uhhuh, how did you know that?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|It's textbook.
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Hey, how long are you in the city?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  I don't know this one.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.|Hi.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.|Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.|You too, sir.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.|What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
Oh, this is my friend Roger.|Dad, dad.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.|Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife?  Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now|Did you know this isn't Ma?
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.|Sure. So how long you been...
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?|Since then?!
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?|...I d'know.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.|You're one to talk.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.|Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|What?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|Y'know, I don't see that happening?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|Hello?
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|It's Phoebe.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|And Rog.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|C'mon up.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|Oh, good. Rog is here.
What's the matter with Rog?|Yeah.
What's the matter with Rog?|Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
What's the matter with Rog?|What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
What's the matter with Rog?|Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
What's the matter with Rog?|I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
What's the matter with Rog?|Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
What's the matter with Rog?|I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
What's the matter with Rog?|Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
What's the matter with Rog?|Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
What's the matter with Rog?|That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
What's the matter with Rog?|Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
What's the matter with Rog?|Isn't he good?
What's the matter with Rog?|Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
What's the matter with Rog?|Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
What's the matter with Rog?|Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
What's the matter with Rog?|You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
What's the matter with Rog?|That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
What's the matter with Rog?|Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
What's the matter with Rog?|Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
What's the matter with Rog?|Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
What's the matter with Rog?|You're welcome.
What's the matter with Rog?|Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
What's the matter with Rog?|Hate that guy!
Night, you guys.|Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?|Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.|Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
I'm Joey Tribbiani.|Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.|Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
That's a good one!|Hey, Joe.
That's a good one!|Dad, Ronni's here.
That's a good one!|Huh?
Hi.|Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.|Thank you. Uh...
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.|So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.|I don't want you taking that thing.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?|Who-ah-ho.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?|We'll go to a hotel.
We'll go to a hotel.|No you won't.
No we won't.|If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
No we won't.|You're gonna keep an eye on us?
No we won't.|That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
Wow. He's strict.|Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.|C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.|Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.|What kinda change?
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.|Well, either you break it off with Ronni
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.|I can't do that!
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.|Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.|Yeah, but this is
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.|I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?|Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Well, you're gonna.|I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?|Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?|No.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."|You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.|Thanks, Chandler.
Hi.|Hi...May I help you?
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?|Okay...who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?|Oh, c'mon in.
Thanks.|Hi, I'm Rachel.
Hi.|Bathroom's up there.
Great.|Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?|Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time.  Hey, Mr. Trib.
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?|Hey. Morning, dear.
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?|Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?|What's the matter with you?!
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?|I thought it was Chandler!
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?|What? What?
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?|You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?|Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
Hey, Pheebs.|Hey.
Hey, Pheebs.|How's it going?
Hey, Pheebs.|Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
Hey, Pheebs.|So what's going on?
Hey, Pheebs.|Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
Hey, Pheebs.|I dunno, there's just something about...
Hey, Pheebs.|Basically we just feel that he's...
Hey, Pheebs.|We hate that guy.
Yeah. Hate him.|We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
Yeah. Hate him.|Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
...No, we hate him.|We're sorry.
Ma! What're you doing here?|I came to give you this
Oww! Big ring!|Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Hold on, you-you knew?|Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!|Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?|Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
I'm...happy...for you?|Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.|I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.|That's sweet. Could I take her?
What's wrong, sweetie?|Nothing, nothing.
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.|It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Oh. They don't.|But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
What?|Intense and creepy.
Oh.|But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.|You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
So you talked to your dad, huh.|Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
So you talked to your dad, huh.|Wow.
So you talked to your dad, huh.|Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
So you talked to your dad, huh.|So Joey, you okay?
So you talked to your dad, huh.|Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
So you talked to your dad, huh.|Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
So you talked to your dad, huh.|If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
So you talked to your dad, huh.|Hey.
So you talked to your dad, huh.|Hey, Pheebs.
How's it going?|Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
How's it going?|Awww.
How's it going?|Yeah, right.
How's it going?|Aaawwwwww!!
How's it going?|What happened?
How's it going?|I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?|Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
Hey, Joey. What's going on?|Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
Hey, Joey. What's going on?|Sorry. Wrong boobies.
Hey, Joey. What's going on?|Hello, Joey.
Hey, Joey. What's going on?|Oh! ...Hello, dear.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.|She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.|Any contact?
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.|She lent me an egg once.
You're in!|Aw, right.
You're in!|Hi, Ross.
You're in!|Hey.
You're in!|Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don't think we need a third...
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.|An egg?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."|I think it's winning.
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."|I think it's insane.
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."|She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
Think it'll work?|No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
You can not do this.|Do what, do what?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.|No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.|'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.|Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.|Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.|Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.|No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.|Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.|Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.|Hi. She said yes.
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.|Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?
How do I look?|Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
How do I look?|Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
How do I look?|...And what did you bring?
How do I look?|She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
How do I look?|Janice?
How do I look?|Oh.... my.... God.
How do I look?|Hey, it's Janice.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.|No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!|Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.|Which one was Pete Carney?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  "Was it good for you?"|Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy.  "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!|I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!|I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!|There's more beer, right?
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!|Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.|Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.|Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.|Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
Or?|Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
Or?|Burning's good.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|That's OK.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|We can't do that.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|What? What can't you do?
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|Uh, we might be leaving now.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|Tell me it's "you and me" we.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|Ok, you can not do this to me.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|I hope she throws up on you.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|So...
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|Just us.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|Oh, what a crappy night!
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|Excuse me.  How ya doin'?
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|So, do we have the best friends or what?
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|I will go for that drink.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|Each.
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know...
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?|No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Kiss me!|Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Kiss me!|Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Hi, Monica.|Ok, well, this was very special.
Hi, Monica.|Rach, come see who's out here!
Hi, Monica.|Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Hi, Monica.|Janice is gonna go away now.
Hi, Monica.|I'll be right back.
Hi, Monica.|Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Hi, Monica.|Whoa.
Hi, Monica.|Oh, good, Joey's home now.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.|Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to.  He just happened to call.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.|That's funny. Who are they?
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.|You mean they're lovers.
If you wanna put a label on it.|Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.|All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.|Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.|Can we just start throwing things in?
Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK.|Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.|Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.

Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.|Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?|I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.|Hello, funny Valentine.
Hi, Just Janice.|Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
Hi, Just Janice.|If you don't do it, I will.
So, um, what do you do for a living?|Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
So, um, what do you do for a living?|Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
So, um, what do you do for a living?|I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.|I guess.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?|Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
What do we got there?|A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture—Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
What do we got there?|You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
What do we got there?|It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
You're our third call tonight.|Really?
You're our third call tonight.|Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
I brought you something.|Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever.
I had them made special.|Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
That's fine.|It is?
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.|Oh no, you see, actually it is.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.|Oh, no I don't.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?|I did, but...
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.|Call me!
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.|You did so. I swear, I swear— How long has she been in the bathroom?
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.|Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
That could be it.|Oh, god.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny|No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Oh, I love you too. But...|No but, no but.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.|That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?|So, um, will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring the bell.|Oh, my god.
I'll even let you ring the bell.|See, there you go, the cleansing works!
I'll even let you ring the bell.|They're nice guys.
I'll even let you ring the bell.|Oh, they're firemen guys.
You guys tell them you were married?|No way!
You guys tell them you were married?|Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
|Thank you.
|Grazie.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.|Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?
Yeah?|Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Chandler.|Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Chandler.|Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
Chandler.|Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really.  Nothing.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...|Hey!
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...|Hey!
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|What's going on?
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|What is it?
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|That's great!
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|So.... I quit.
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|Why?
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
So was it a lot more money?|It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
So was it a lot more money?|... the WENUS?
So was it a lot more money?|Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
So was it a lot more money?|Oh. That WENUS.
So was it a lot more money?|So what're you going to do?
So was it a lot more money?|I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve?  Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.|Um... hi there.
Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....|Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Yeah, yeah!|Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.|Oh my God!
Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think?|Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?|No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?|Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."|Career counselor?
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.|I don't!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.|Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.|Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.|Ooh! Brian's Song!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.|The meeting with the guy went great?
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.|So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|What are you going to make?
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|Yummy noises.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|And Monica, what are you going to make?
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|Ooh! I know what you could make!
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
Who are you going out with?|Oh, is this the bug lady?
Who are you going out with?|Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
Who are you going out with?|Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
Who are you going out with?|So what are you guys going to do?
Who are you going out with?|Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.|huh-huh?
And he's not speaking metaphorically.|Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.
And he's not speaking metaphorically.|I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...|I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
OK, try this salmon mousse.|Mmmm. Good.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?|It's creamier.
Yeah, well, is that better?|I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Yeah, well, is that better?|My God! What happened to you?
Yeah, well, is that better?|Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Yeah, well, is that better?|That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Yeah, well, is that better?|Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Yeah, well, is that better?|Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.|Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.|Well.... it is amouz-ing...
|Ten dollars an hour for what?
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.|Waitressing?
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.|Uh-oh.
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...|But, but?
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.|Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.|You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.
Talk to me.|OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
No no no. Talk... dirty.|Wha... what, here?
Yes...|Ah....
Say something..... hot.|Er.... um.....
What?|Um... uh.... vulva.
Vulva?|Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??|Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.|Please be kidding.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.|OK.  I'm in my apartment...
....yeah... what else?|That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?|Joey, please.
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.|Wow.
Alright, now you say something.|I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Come on! You like this woman, right?|Yeah.
You want to see her again, right?|Sure.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!|OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.|Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!|I, er...
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!|I want to take my tongue... and...
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!|....and....
Say it... say it!|...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Say it... say it!|....with??
Say it... say it!|Funny story!
You're not going to believe this!|It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.|Again?
And again, and again, and again...  And again.|
Well?|Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Look at this!|Oh! You have a window!
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...|Oh look! That guy's peeing!
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.|OK.
|Who was that?
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.|Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Ten dollars an hour.|No.
Twelve dollars an hour.|Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour.|Done.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?|Hi Steve!
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?|Hello, Monica.  Hello, greeter girl.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?|This is Rachel.

Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?|Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?|I was just being polite, but, alright.
What's up?|In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
What?|Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.|
Let me, let me get you some wine!|Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. ... ginger.
Let me, let me get you some wine!|Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Let me, let me get you some wine!|I'm so glad you liked them!
Let me, let me get you some wine!|Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Let me, let me get you some wine!|Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Let me, let me get you some wine!|Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?|You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.

What a tool!|Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
So, er... how did it go with Celia?|Oh, I was unbelievable.
All right, Ross!|I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Whoa! And the...  huh-huh?|Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
You cuddled.|Yeah, which was nice.
You cuddled.|You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
You cuddled.|Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
How's this?|Eeeee!
Sorry. How about over here?|Aaaaah!
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?|No.
What about this?|Aaaaahhh!!
This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.|There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
It’s Phoebe! Hi!|Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?|Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now I’m here.
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?|No, no... how come you are working here?

How could you lose him?|Rachel lost Marcel.
How could you lose him?|Oh no, how?
How could you lose him?|He- he pooped in my shoe.
How could you lose him?|Which one?
How could you lose him?|Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
How could you lose him?|No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
How could you lose him?|C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?|Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?|Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?|Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?|Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?|Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?|Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
Whaddyou want?|Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?|No!
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?|Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
I wasn't ready for it.|A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Saw Regis Philbin once...|Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.|Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?|Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?|Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  Well-
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.|Okay, quick and painful.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.|Oh, what? What-what?
Y'know Marcel?|...Yeah?
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.|I know, I know, I'm sorry-
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.|Oh! Who is it?
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.|Animal Control.
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.|See? I've even called Animal Control!
You called Animal Control?|Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.|O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!|Hi, thanks for coming.
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!|Somebody called about a monkey?
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!|Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.|Turned out it was a hat.
Cat!|Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
Cat!|Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
Cat!|Marcel?
My uncle Marcel.|Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
My uncle Marcel.|Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
My uncle Marcel.|Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
My uncle Marcel.|Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
My uncle Marcel.|Yes, but there isn't always time!
My uncle Marcel.|Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
My uncle Marcel.|Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
My uncle Marcel.|Yeah!
My uncle Marcel.|Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
My uncle Marcel.|Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
My uncle Marcel.|The Luisa from home room!
My uncle Marcel.|Yes!!
My uncle Marcel.|You have no idea who I am, do you.
My uncle Marcel.|No, none at all.
My uncle Marcel.|None.
My uncle Marcel.|Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
My uncle Marcel.|Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
My uncle Marcel.|Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems.  But you? What a bitch!
My uncle Marcel.|What?!
My uncle Marcel.|Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
My uncle Marcel.|I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
My uncle Marcel.|Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
Marcel?|Marcel?
Marcel?|Marcel?
Marcel?|Hi, can I help you?
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...|A monkey.
Yes have you seen any?|No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Yes have you seen any?|Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
Yes have you seen any?|Of course.
Yes have you seen any?|Oh. Then, no.
Yes have you seen any?|Did I put too much rum in here?
Yes have you seen any?|Just a sec.
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.|Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.|We can't, alright?  We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.|Marcel?
Marcel?|Marcel?
Marcel?|Marcel?
Oh-my-God!|Whaaat!
Something just brushed up against my right leg!|What is it?
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.|Look, Phoebe!
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!|Step aside, ladies!
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!|What're you gonna do?
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!|Just a small tranquiliser.
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!|Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel!  Are you okay?
Yeah, think so. Oh!  Whoah.|Oh gosh.
Marcel?|Marcel?
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.|Ross, you don't know that.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.  And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.|Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!|Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...|Ross.
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...|Ross.
Oh, forget it, okay?|Ross!
What? What?|Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
What? What?|Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
Hi, did you order some bananas?|What about it?
Gimme back my monkey.|I don't have a monkey.
Gimme back my monkey.|Then what's with all the bananas?
Gimme back my monkey.|Potassium.
Marcel! What've you done to him?|That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.|C'mere, Patti.
C'mere, Marcel.|C'mere, Patti.
C'mere, Marcel.|Gotcha.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.|That's my monkey.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.|You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.|That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
Alright, I want my monkey.|No!
Alright, I want my monkey.|Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
Alright, I want my monkey.|Sorry, prom queen.
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.|Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.|Nope.
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.|Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will.  Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.|Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...|Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?|That'd be good.
Alright.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...|Rachel.
Alright.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...|Barry?!
Alright.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...|I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
Alright.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...|Oh!
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?|Nope.
That's because I'm in front of them.|Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.|I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.|Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?|Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.|No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.|I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy.
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.|Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.|I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.|Oh, that is so sick.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.|How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...|So have you called her yet?
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  I'm right, right?|Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  I'm right, right?|I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  I'm right, right?|Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.|Her answer machine?
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.|So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."|Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."|Okay, okay, what's going on?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."|Okay, they're just talking...
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."|Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."|No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."|What? What? What?!
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."|That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.|Oh!... Right!
Hey Rach!|How'd it go?
Hey Rach!|Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out...
Hey Rach!|Not a good day for birds...
Hey Rach!|Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...
Hey Rach!|That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?
Hey Rach!|Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!
Hey Rach!|That's, that's nice twice!
Hey Rach!|Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?
Hey Rach!|Duh, where've you been?
Hey Rach!|Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?
Yes!|Why?
I have my reasons.|Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
I have my reasons.|All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!
Wow... Wow!|Yeah.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.|Nooo, it wasn't.
Oh God!|That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Hey, I've been honing!|What was with the dishes?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.|Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.|Oh my God!  Stop looking in here!
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.|Great, now he's waving back.
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.|Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.|What kinda stuff?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.|Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.|You cook naked?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.|Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
What's the matter?|Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
No, it was. It was very very good.|Well, what about Mindy?
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.|No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.|No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.|Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.
Let's go away this weekend.|Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.|I had a bra.
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.|Hey, Dr. Farber.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.|What?!
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.|I'm twelve, I'm not stupid.
Can I use your phone?|Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?|Maybe she never got your message.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?|Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...|...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.|How many beeps?
She answered.|Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|Hey! Hi!
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|How'd he take it?
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|Pretty well, actually...
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|Oh, do I?
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|Uh huh.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|We ended up having sex in his chair.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|You-you had what?
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|Sex in his chair.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|What, uh... what were you thinking?
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|Please. If she said to you, "Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now," what would you say?
If it helps, I could slide over.|It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
If it helps, I could slide over.|Where are you going?
If it helps, I could slide over.|I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?
Hello? Hello?|Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
So how's Mindy?|Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry...  Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Brrrrrrr!|Hell is filled with people like you.
Brrrrrrr!|He's back! The peeper's back!
Brrrrrrr!|Get down!
Brrrrrrr!|Get down?
Brrrrrrr!|...And boogie!
Brrrrrrr!|Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.|Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.|Yeah?
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.|And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so..
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.|..Naughty!
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.|Right, I'll see you guys later...
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.|Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  That's fine, yeah...
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.|Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?
Why don't you just take it with you?|Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Why don't you just call her?|I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Do you?|No!  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Don't you have to pee?|'S'why I'm dancing...
Mindy.|Hey, you.
Hey, you.... So, what's up?|Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Sure we should... So.|Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Okay.|Will you be my maid of honour?
Of course!|Oh that's so great!
Was that all you wanted to ask me?|That's all!
Ohhhh!!  ...What? What?|That's not all.
Oh sure it is!|Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Um, what- what would make you think that?|Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.|Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
What? What's what you were afraid of?|Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
What?|I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.|What do you mean?
Smell familiar?|Oh no.
Oh, I am so sorry.|No me, I am so sorry...
Oh, I am so sorry.|Oh my.
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".|Ring dammit, ring!

Uh, we are here to break up with you.|Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
Uh, we are here to break up with you.|I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?|....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?|I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!|You did it twice?
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.|Okay...
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.|Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.|Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.|Oh God...  Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.|Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!|Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Oh God.|I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
You okay?|Yeah.
Really?|Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Aww...|Big day.

All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...|Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...|...I'm, I'm okay.

All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...|Second date!
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...|...I dunno.
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...|You don't know?!
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...|Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|I know. It's just such reckless spending.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|That's me.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|What? It's, it's just a phase.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Well, that's what we said about Joey...
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|What?
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.|This woman's living my life.
What?|She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You're not an artist.|Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.|Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...|Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Nooo...|This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
How about Joey... Pepponi?|No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Joey... Switzerland?|Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  Which I'm not.
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?|Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...|Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Might wanna try Joseph.|Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|Hi.  Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
Hey.|What are you doing?
Hey.|I'm going to tap class.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?|This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.|This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
What d'you think?|Lotsa things.
What d'you think?|Which one do you think she is?
What d'you think?|May I help you?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.|You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.|What does she mean?
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.|I think she means
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?|People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?|She could be you.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?|Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
Okay, I'm not getting this!|I'm totally getting it!
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?|What? You just click when they click.
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?|Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?|Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
Great. It's gym class all over again.|Aww.
Great. It's gym class all over again.|Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.|It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.|She's your partner.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.|Hi. I'm Monica.
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.|Monana?
Yeah. It's Dutch.|You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.|And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
Hi.|Hey.
Hi.|Where've you been?
At the vet.|She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.|Hey! He beat ya.
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.|So what does this mean?
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!|I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!|I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
Isn't there any way you can keep him?|No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?|I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?|Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?|Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?|Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?|What?
Did you call the cops?|Nope. We took her to lunch.
Did you call the cops?|Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
Did you call the cops?|What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
Did you call the cops?|Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
Did you call the cops?|Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
Did you call the cops?|...Take off their hats!
Did you call the cops?|Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
No way. No way did you do this.|Monana was very brave.
No way. No way did you do this.|It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
No way. No way did you do this.|So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
No way. No way did you do this.|...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|'Scuse me?
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|What?
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|Uh-huh.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.|I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?|Oh, somebody will.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?|You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?|You're kidding.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?|Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?|Y'know, you'd think I would've.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?|Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?|...Flame Boy.
Where exactly is your zoo?|Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Yes.|Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
No-no, he's, he's very docile.|Even if he were... cornered?
Well I, I don't know. Why?|Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...|How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Why- why- why would he need a blade?|Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?|He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
Why- why- why would he need a blade?|We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
Why- why- why would he need a blade?|...He's in.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!|You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
Yo- hooo!|Where the hell've you been?
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.|Are you drunk?!
Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.|Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.|Monica? Monica!
Water rules!|Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.|Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!|Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.|What?
Hi.|Hey.
How are you?|I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.|That I was not expecting.
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.|Oh. Thanks.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!|Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?|Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.|There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Not necessarily...|Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Um, I'm not actually Amish.|Really? Then why are you like that?
You by the door. In or out?|In.
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!|Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!

Hello Rachel.|Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?
Hello Rachel.|Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients.

Hey, hey. How was the first day?|Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
Hey, hey. How was the first day?|Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?|What are you talking about?

My scones.|'My scones.'
My scones.|Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true.
My scones.|That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!
Did not.|I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
How was that possible?|Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there?  Oh, ah. I should go.
Okay.|Okay.
Unless...|What?
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...|Yeah, I'd really like that.
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...|Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'|Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Ethan?|Yeah?
Are you a virgin?|Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Really?|Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Wow!|You keep saying that.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.|Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.|No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Oh.|Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Huh!|But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.|You're not a senior?
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.|Ok...ay.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.|I just had sex.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?|Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?|I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Don't say it.|...in love with you.
Really?|Sorry.
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.|Who?
Just easier that way.|Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Just easier that way.|No, forget it.
Just easier that way.|Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?
Just easier that way.|All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there.  Joey was there too.
Just easier that way.|All right.
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.|No.
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?|No, it was just the three of us.
Huh!|So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Huh!|You know what?
Huh!|What?
Huh!|There were times when it wasn't even me.

Huh!|Oh.
Are you not seeing him anymore?|No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Are you not seeing him anymore?|And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
Are you not seeing him anymore?|I, I didn't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. He stopped by.
Are you not seeing him anymore?|Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?

It's morphin time!|Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are.

Then, I don't get it.|Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.

I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great.
It was.|Then, what's the problem?
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.|Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...|No, don't say it.

God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.|What, it's ok when Chandler does it?
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.|You have to pick your moments.

Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.|Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Maybe you should.|Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?

Who the hell is Jordie?|Your son.
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.|Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.|Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
I got it.|I got it.
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.|No, you don't.

Breathe, breathe, breathe...|Oh, no.
Breathe, breathe, breathe...|Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?|Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Please. This is so your fault.|How, how is this my fault?
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.|Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?|You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Oh, I'm threatened by you?|Yes.
Oh, I'm threatened by you?|Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!
Yeah, Susan.|Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Yeah, Susan.|Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?
Help!|I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back.  Ow.
Are they here yet?|No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Ok.|Ok?
Ok.|Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating.
Ok.|It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel.  There you go, dear.
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?|Help! Help!
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?|la la la la la la.
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?|Help!
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.  Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.|Where have you been?
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.  Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.|Oh, just had a baby.
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.  Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.|Mazel tov!
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?|No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.|Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.|Oh.
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?|I'm a waitress.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...|Yeah. Gotcha.
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.|Ok. That's fine.
So how did you know I was even here?|Your mom called me. So is this her?
No, this is a loaner.|I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?|Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.  This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.|The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?|You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.|This is so great.
You wanna explain that?|I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.  I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Where are they?|I'm sure they'll be here soon.
Where are they?|Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this.
Where are they?|Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
Where are they?|You are really frightening me.
Where are they?|Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Anybody seen a nipple?
Where are they?|All right, ten centimeters, here we go.
Where are they?|All right, honey, time to start pushing.
But they're not here yet!|I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Ok, got the vent open.|Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.|What do you see?
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.|Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent.
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!|Wait! You forgot your legs!
Push, push!|We're here!
Push, push!|Where have you been?
Push, push!|Long story, honey.
Push, push!|All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need— Excuse me, could I have this?
Push, push!|All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!
Good luck!|Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
Good luck!|Out!
Good luck!|All right, he's crowning. Here he comes.
Good luck!|Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?
Good luck!|Not.... helping!
Good luck!|You're doing great, you're doing fine.
Good luck!|Oh, sorry.
Good luck!|What do you see? What do you see?
Good luck!|We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person.

I mean, this is unbelievable.|No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
I mean, this is unbelievable.|Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
I mean, this is unbelievable.|OK, is there a mute button on this woman?
I mean, this is unbelievable.|I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?|Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.|H-He's in China!
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.|The country.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.|No, no, wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.|What about the time difference?
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.|From here to the airport?
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.|Yes!  You're never gonna make it!
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.|Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?
I-I-I don't know.|Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
I-I-I don't know.|He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.
I-I-I don't know.|Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.|Here, look, alright, does this help?
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.|Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
|Alright!
Ni-chou chi-ma!|Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Ni-chou chi-ma!|Hi!
Ni-chou chi-ma!|Hi.
Ni-chou chi-ma!|May I see your boarding pass?
Ni-chou chi-ma!|Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend.
Ni-chou chi-ma!|Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.
Ni-chou chi-ma!|No, I know, but I—he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just...
Ni-chou chi-ma!|No no no! Federal regulations!
Ni-chou chi-ma!|OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important.
Ni-chou chi-ma!|Alright. What's the message?
Ni-chou chi-ma!|Uh... I don't know.
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.|What?
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.|: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!|Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!|Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
M-Me again?|Sure! Why not?
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.|How do you mean?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?|I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?|Sure.
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?|I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!|Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Another good point.|No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Another good point.|Huh?
Another good point.|Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?
Why isn't it working out?|I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Is he not cute enough for you?|No!
Does he not make enough money?|No, I'm just....
Does he not make enough money?|Maybe there's someone else.
Does he not make enough money?|Wha...
Is there? Is there someone else?|No! There is.. there is noone else!
Hey, big...|Shhhh!
...spender.|She's still asleep.
So how'd it go?|Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.|Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.|It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I didn't know you had another level.|I know! Neither did I!
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?|Yeah.
Oh, from who?|From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?|Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Oh, why?|Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!|Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.|Who is it?
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.|It's me, Carl.
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.|C'mon up.
Seven hundred bucks!|Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.|Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!|I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!|Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here.

I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!|So I'm thinking about you. So what?
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!|I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!|Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|Ross, it's too hard.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|Ross, you're like my best friend.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|I know.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|If we broke up, and I lost you...

I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|Well, start looking.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|Wow.
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!|Right! You're right!
Heh... y'know?|You know what?
What?|I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!|Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!|Oh, thanks, sweetie.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!|No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.

Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.|Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time.
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.|Bye.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?|Yeah, sure.
Thank you.|Hey, Rach, can I get...
Thank you.|Did you talk to him?
Thank you.|Not yet.
Thank you.|Then, no.
Thank you.|So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?|God?
It was you, pal.|Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.|Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.|Here's your lemonade.
I didn't order lemonade.|Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
But...|Go-go-go-go, come on!  So uh, what did you find out?
But...|He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.
But...|How is that the silver lining?
But...|You have to really wanna see it.
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?|Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.|All right, so what were you thinking?
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?|Ohh! No.
Why not?|Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
No you're not.|I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
No you're not.|
No you're not.|Hello? Hi.
No you're not.|Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
No you're not.|Needs some clothes altered?
No you're not.|No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
No you're not.|Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15.  All right, when was 1990?
No you're not.|Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
No you're not.|Well you didn't hang up either.
No you're not.|She didn't hang up either!
No you're not.|Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
No you're not.|Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
No you're not.|Rachel! I'll just call her back.
No you're not.|Okay!
No you're not.|
No you're not.|Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.|I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.|Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
You know, I think I was sixteen.|Please, just a little bit off the back.
You know, I think I was sixteen.|I'm still on "no."
You know, I think I was sixteen.|Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.|What's goin' on?
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.|Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.|What stupid thing did you do?
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.|Bon giorno tutti!
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.|Ewww!
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.|Rachel, how did this happen?
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.|Where?
At his apartment. Is this juice?|Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|People do stupid things when they're upset.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|Hi!
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|Hi. Sorry we're late but we were—well, there was touching.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|Hey, hey Ross.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|I do Raquel.
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|So, uh, he's back.
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?|No, not a problem.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.|Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.|Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.|Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.|Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.|You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.|All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.|I promise.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.|All right.  Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
All right, that's it, I quit.|What? I didn't say anything.
Yeah, but this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.|I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.|How who wears it?
Demi Moore.|Demi Moore is not a he.
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.|That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Oh.  Oh!|Oh my God!
Oh my God!|Oh my God!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?|She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.|I know!
How long do you want the cuffs?|At least as long as I have the pants.
How is she?|It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
How is she?|How's the hair?
How is she?|I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
How is she?|Can we see her?
How is she?|Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
How is she?|Yeah.
How is she?|How're you doing?
I'm okay.|Ooh, that bad, huh?
What?|Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.|You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?|What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
I don't know, I don't know.|Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
I don't know, I don't know.|Your tailor is a very bad man!
I don't know, I don't know.|Frankie? What're you talking about?
I don't know, I don't know.|
I don't know, I don't know.|Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
I don't know, I don't know.|What?
I don't know, I don't know.|No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
I don't know, I don't know.|Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
I don't know, I don't know.|What?
I don't know, I don't know.|Cupping.
I don't know, I don't know.|That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
I don't know, I don't know.|Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
I don't know, I don't know.|What? That's not?  Oh my God.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.|I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|Thank you.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|Wait, are you leaving?
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|Okay.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|That's ok.
What's goin' on?|Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?|No. No-no-no-no.
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.|Really?
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?|No, I think that was the whole all.
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?|Oh yeah!  Oh, I can do that.
Really?|You wanna do it right now?
Great!|Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
Great!|No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
Great!|Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
Great!|You're welcome.
|Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it.  Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
|Oh, is he hungry already?
|I guess so.
|You know, it's...
|I gotta get one, too.
|What are you guys doing?
|We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
|Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
|Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
|This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
|Carol?
|Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
|Sure.
|Uh, does it hurt?
|It did at first, but not anymore.
|Chandler?
|So, uh, how often can you do it?
|As much as he needs.
|Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?|Yeah, I forget which ones.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?|No thanks.
|What a bitch.
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?|I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?|Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Great.|Hi, honey.
Great.|Hey, sweetums.
Great.|Hello to the rest.
Great.|Hi!
Great.|Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Great.|It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Great.|Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Great.|But I'm...
Great.|Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Great.|So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Great.|Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Great.|It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Great.|You're welcome.
Great.|Woof, woof.
Hey Annabelle.|Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
Who?|Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
Who?|
What's he doin' in my section?|I guess he doesn't know.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok?  Hey, how ya doin'?|Mornin'.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.|Your territory, huh?
Yeah. Bijan for men?|No thanks.
Yeah. Bijan for men?|Hombre?
Yeah. Bijan for men?|Yeah. All right.
Yeah. Bijan for men?|You were saying?
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.|What?
We were shopping, and we had lunch.|Oh, all right. What did I have?
You had a salad.|Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
You had a salad.|Hey, guys, what's up.
You had a salad.|I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
You had a salad.|Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
You had a salad.|Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
You had a salad.|You went shopping for fur?
You had a salad.|Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some,  uh, boobs.
You had a salad.|You bought boobs?
You had a salad.|Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.|Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.|Ready, Annabelle?
Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.|You bet.  Maybe some other time?
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.|Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.|Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.|Oh, this is so cute.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.|Oh, I got that for him.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.|My mommies love me. That's clever.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.|Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju—
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.|Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.|Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
Ben, dinner!|Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.|What did you just do?
I licked my arm, what?|It's breast milk.
So?|Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
So?|What is the big deal?
So?|What did you just do?
So?|Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
You won't even taste it?|No!
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?|Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Hey, where is everybody?|They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.|Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way.
Okay.|Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.|And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.|Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Judy.|Who?
Julie.|What?!
Jody!|You were with Julie?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.|Oh. Oh my God.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.|Yeah, right.  Sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!|Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
That is not true!|Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?|Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
Hi, Steve.|Hey!
Hi, Steve.|How did we do?
Hi, Steve.|Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
Hi, Steve.|I did not freak out.
Hi, Steve.|Why'd you freak out?
Hi, Steve.|Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
Hi, Steve.|My breast milk is gross?
Hi, Steve.|This should be fun.
Hi, Steve.|No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
Hi, Steve.|Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
Hi, Steve.|Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
Hi, Steve.|That would be no.
Hi, Steve.|Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
Hi, Steve.|Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
Hi, Steve.|Cantaloupe juice.
Hi, Steve.|Exactly.
Hi, Steve.|You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
Hi, Steve.|Uh huh.
Hi, Steve.|Oh, you've tasted it.
Hi, Steve.|You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
Hi, Steve.|
Howdy.|Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.|Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.|I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?|Yeah I guess you're right.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.|I'm gonna do it.
I don't know what else to say.|Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
I feel terrible, I really do.|Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Rachel,  say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?|Yes.
It's that terrible?|Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,  you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.|I love you too.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,  you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.|You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?|I'd do anything for you, you know that.
|Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Mornin'.  I said, mornin'.|I heard ya.
Mornin'.  I said, mornin'.|All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
Mornin'.  I said, mornin'.|Ready.
Yeah, I'm ready.|You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
Yeah, I'm ready.|Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
Yeah, I'm ready.|I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I'm ready.|My god, what happened?
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?|Sure.
So.|So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.|Really? Me?
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.|Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Oy.|Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?|Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.|All right, Julie.
Bye.|Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
That's not bad.|Hey.
That's not bad.|So how was Joan?
That's not bad.|I broke up with her.
That's not bad.|They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them.
That's not bad.|Come on, they were not that huge.
That's not bad.|I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain.
That's not bad.|How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
That's not bad.|Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts.
That's not bad.|You or me?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.|You guys are messin' with me, right?
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.|Yeah.
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.|That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, "whoa."
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.|You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.|Maureen Rosilla.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|Hello, Mr. Heckles.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|You're doing it again.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|We're not doing anything.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|You don't have birds.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|I could have birds.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|All right, bye-bye.
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky.
We'll give you Janice.|I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
We'll give you Janice.|"Oh, my, god."
We'll give you Janice.|"Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"
We'll give you Janice.|Stop with the broom, we're not making noise.
We'll give you Janice.|We won. We won!
We'll give you Janice.|Mr. Heckles.
We'll give you Janice.|How did this happen?
We'll give you Janice.|He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
We'll give you Janice.|That's terrible.
We'll give you Janice.|I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS: Sure, sweepin'. You never know.
We'll give you Janice.|You never know.
We'll give you Janice.|Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!
We'll give you Janice.|Ok, Phoebe.
We'll give you Janice.|I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.
We'll give you Janice.|Such as?
We'll give you Janice.|Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?|Nah. Not really.
You don't believe in evolution?|I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?|Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.|Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|What can we do for you?
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine".
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|Well, what about his family?
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|He didn't have any.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|Ok, so let's talk money.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|Have you ever seen so much crap?
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|Check this out. Can I have this?
How can you not believe in evolution?|Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.|Really? You can actually see it?
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.|See, I didn't know that.
Well, there you go.|Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Well, there you go.|Hey, look at this. "My Big Book of Grievances."
Well, there you go.|Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too.
Well, there you go.|April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent.
Well, there you go.|Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this.
Well, there you go.|Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps.
Well, there you go.|What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool.
Well, there you go.|It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
Well, there you go.|Well, what about my stuff?
Well, there you go.|You don't have any stuff.
Well, there you go.|You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?
Well, there you go.|No.
Well, there you go.|Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room.
Well, there you go.|Mmmmm.
Well, there you go.|Ok, while you "mmm" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?|Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Please tell me you're joking.|Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--|What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Wow, he looks so normal.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|He's even kind of cute.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|"Heckles, you crack me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Funniest? Heckles?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|That's what it says.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|I'd call that excessive.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Whoa!
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|What?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|So, you were both dorks. Big deal.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Have you been here all night?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Chandler, Heckles was a nut case.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it "supposably"?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|How do you know that? How?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Yeah, I understand.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Hi, it's me.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Oh, my, god.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Janice? You called Janice?
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?
You remember Janice, right?|Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
You remember Janice, right?|Helloo!!
You remember Janice, right?|Oh, my, god!
You remember Janice, right?|Geez, look how fat she got.
You remember Janice, right?|Hey, it's everybody.
You remember Janice, right?|Janice, you're--
You remember Janice, right?|Yes, I am.
You remember Janice, right?|Is it--?
You remember Janice, right?|Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now.
You remember Janice, right?|Congratulations.
You remember Janice, right?|Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
You remember Janice, right?|You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
You remember Janice, right?|And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
You remember Janice, right?|Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?
You remember Janice, right?|What?
You remember Janice, right?|Hide the Lamp.
You remember Janice, right?|Monica, let it go.
You remember Janice, right?|Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
You remember Janice, right?|Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps.
You remember Janice, right?|Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.|Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.|Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.|I can't believe you caved.
What?|You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
What?|I am. Let me just get my coat.
What?|Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.
What?|Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?
What?|Phoebe, tell her!
What?|Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.
What?|Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
What?|Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
What?|Ok, you win.
What?|Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.
What?|Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.
What?|Uh huh. Why is that?
What?|If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. "Run away from Crazy Snake Man," they'll shout!
What?|You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
What?|Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.
What?|Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.
What?|You are not a freak. You're a guy.
What?|She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
What?|Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.
What?|In a bad way?
What?|No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.
What?|Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
What?|Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!
What?|You made it!
What?|You're there!
What?|You are ready to make a commitment!
What?|Whoa! Don't know about that.
What?|What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
What?|No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.
What?|Thank you.
What?|That's fine.
What?|Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.
What?|Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?
What?|I'll take that.
What?|You want his yearbook?
What?|Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.
What?|Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.
What?|It's really not that big!
What?|Takin' that with you, huh?
What?|Oh, yeah.
You comin'?|Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
You comin'?|Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see "Philosopher wanted"?
You comin'?|Sure.
Hi.|Hi, hi can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?|Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. [leaves flowers on bar]|What? [in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot and lets it get away]
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.

This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|Wait a minute, who told you? [turns to Chandler who's looking sheepish] You are dead meat.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|I didn't know it was a big secret.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|You have a third nipple?
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|You bitch.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|Whip it out, whip it out.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.|Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.|Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.

Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.|That is wild.
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.|[to Chandler] So what's it shaped like?
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.|Yeah, is there a hair on it?
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?|Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?|You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?|Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?|[to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?|Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?|Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.

Woah.|The Ice Capades?
Woah.|No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
Woah.|I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
Woah.|OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
Woah.|[holding cream pitcher] Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. [holds pitcher in front of Chandler's chest and flips the lid] Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
Woah.|Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.|See you later Rach.
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.|Bye-bye Julie. [Julie leaves]
Hey.|Hey.

Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?|Technically, huh, no.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?|No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.|It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?|What?
I think it's sexy.|Sexy?
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.|No kidding?
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?|What?
I'd wait.|You'd wait?
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.|Really?
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.|Women really want this?

Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.|What did, what did he say?
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.|Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.|Pop it in.

What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.|Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.|What's wrong with people having sex?
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.|Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.|Hell, I wanna see Joey.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.|OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.|All I say is, she better get the job.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.|Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.

So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.|Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Ohh. . .K. How come?|Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
What?|Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Huuh.|Yeah, I know, I.
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.|I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
So how long have you known?|Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?|Her name's Debra.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?|Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Sure.|But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'|I'm, I'm still me.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.|That saves us a conversation.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.|Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.|Me too, we should get goin'.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.|No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
Rachel, that's all we do.|Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Rachel, that's all we do.|What about Julie?
Rachel, that's all we do.|Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
Rachel, that's all we do.|Well, that could take a while.
Rachel, that's all we do.|So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
Rachel, that's all we do.|I got the time to get to know Julie.

Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?|Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?|OK, now I'm nervous.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?|Maybe you should put it off.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?|No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.

Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?|[being drawn in by her talk] Uh-huh.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?|And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?|Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. [goes back in apartment]
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?|Ohh, God.
Good morning.|Well, somebody got some last night.
Man, I sure miss Julie.|Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?|No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?|Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
You ever figure out what that thing's for?|What?

Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."|I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.|Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.

Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?|Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?|Do I dare ask?
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?|Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
That sounds great. Same for me.|And for the gentleman?

I hear ya.|Well, then...Let's.
I, I just never think of money as an issue.|That's 'cause you have it.
That's a good point.|So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
That's a good point.|'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?|Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?|If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?|No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.|No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.

Come on.|Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Come on.|It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.

Could you be less enthused?|Like?
Could you be less enthused?|Charity.
Could you be less enthused?|Charity?
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.|Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.|Actually, it makes us feel that big.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|Me neither.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|Me too.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|Guys, we bought the tickets.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|Why did you look at me when you said that?
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|Well, I guess now we can't go.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|You know what? You're right.

Whoa! You had sex today?|Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Wow.|Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Still doing the screening thing?|I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Still doing the screening thing?|Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
Still doing the screening thing?|Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
Still doing the screening thing?|Bob here.
Still doing the screening thing?|Oh, hi.
Still doing the screening thing?|So, uh, you met someone, huh?
Still doing the screening thing?|Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
Still doing the screening thing?|So, uh, how was he?
Still doing the screening thing?|Eh.
Still doing the screening thing?|Eh?
Still doing the screening thing?|Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
Still doing the screening thing?|Well, that makes me feel so good.
Still doing the screening thing?|It was just so awkward and bumpy.
Bumpy?|Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Bumpy?|Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
Bumpy?|You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.|So, let's go.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.|Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.|You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.|Come on you guys, one more time.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.|Ok. One.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.|Nooo.

Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.|You know, a party, or--
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.|What party?
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.|You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.|Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.|Who gave you that hickey?
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.|That would be the work of a Blowfish.
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.|Oh!
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.|Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.|What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?

Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.|Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...

There's my little boy.|Can I uh see something?
There's my little boy.|Cool.
He hates me. My nephew hates me.|Come on, don't do this.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?|Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.

No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.|Ugh.
Oh my god.|Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.

Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.|You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Jacket now.|What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.

Jacket now.|What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?
Jacket now.|I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window.
Jacket now.|Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.
Jacket now.|Hat, milk, got it.

Jacket now.|What's up?
Jacket now.|F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
Jacket now.|But what about Phoebe?
Jacket now.|Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.
Jacket now.|Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her.
Jacket now.|Uh--
Jacket now.|Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?
Jacket now.|Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed.
Jacket now.|You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?
Jacket now.|It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby.

Jacket now.|But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk.
Jacket now.|Honey, I'm sorry.
Jacket now.|And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top.
Jacket now.|Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying "Terry's a jerk!" That's where that came from.
Jacket now.|Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could.
Jacket now.|Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.
Jacket now.|I, I don't know.
Jacket now.|Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine.

Jacket now.|Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional.
Jacket now.|Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid.
Jacket now.|Well, but Pheebs.
Jacket now.|No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.  Thank you! La la la la la la la....
Jacket now.|Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun.
Jacket now.|Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.|Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.|No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.|Tho?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.|Ohhh.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?|Ok.

Yep.|Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.
Hopefully.|Well. [looks at watch] Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. [she leaves carrying her tray then comes back in] OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.|[distracted] How long do cats live?
[confused] I'm sorry?|Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.|That's just great. [she picks up her champagne and starts drinking]
Um, cheers.|Oh, right, clink. [downs her glass]
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?|Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.|I mean he just started going out with her.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?|Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
Alright.|OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
So, I figured it out.|What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.|Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.|Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
[obviously drunk] I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? [belligerently] What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?|Fruitflies?
So, would you like any dessert?|No! No dessert, just a check, please.
So, would you like any dessert?|Oh, you're not having fun, are you?
So, would you like any dessert?|No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.
So, would you like any dessert?|Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?
So, would you like any dessert?|Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.
So, would you like any dessert?|Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?
So, would you like any dessert?|Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."
So, would you like any dessert?|Closure, that's what it is. Closure. [she looks around the restaurant, spotting a guy with a cellular phone] Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo [she almost falls out of her chair]
So, would you like any dessert?|Hang on.
So, would you like any dessert?|Hello, excuse me.
So, would you like any dessert?|What.
So, would you like any dessert?|Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.
So, would you like any dessert?|I'm talkin'!
So, would you like any dessert?|I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. [man is still reluctant] OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone.
So, would you like any dessert?|Alright, fine. [on the phone] I'll call you back. [hands the phone to her]
So, would you like any dessert?|Thank you. OK. [dials] [to Michael] Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
So, would you like any dessert?|Good.
So, would you like any dessert?|[on phone] Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. [hangs up and tosses phone in the ice bucket]
No, no, no, no, no, no [opens door to Monica] No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.|Why not?
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.|OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
OK, stop.|No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo [Chandler walks out of the apartment, leaving Monica] Woo.
Hey Rachel.|Ahhhh.
Oh. And how was the date?|Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?|I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
OK. Oh, oh, oh. [runs over and picks up the cat toy]|Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.|Huh.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?|Oh yeah, go ahead. [Rachel walks in her room. Ross picks up the phone and dials his machine to check his messages.]
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . [jumps the couch and lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.]|You're over me?
Ohhhhhhhh God. [climbs off his back]|Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Ohh, ohh.|When, when were you... under me? Rachel. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.|You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.|Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Chandler told me.|Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
When you were in China.|China.
Meeting Julie.|Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
[doorbell buzzes] That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. [talks on intercom] Hi Julie.|[over intercom] Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
[perky] I'll be right down.|Wait, so, you're going?
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.|OK, OK.
Hey Joey.|Hey Phoebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?|I can't find the remote. [Phoebe turns off the TV] Thank you.
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.|And?
And we did.|All right Phoebs, way to go.
Yay me.|So, so how did it happen?
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.|And what did he say?
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.|Wow.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.|Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Um-hum.|This man is my God.
Hi.|I didn't get a cat.
Oh, that's um, interesting.|No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Alright, I got it Ross.|You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
[hurt] What?|I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?|Then you should have said something before I met her.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.|There was never a good time.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.|Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?|The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?|Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.|Fine.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.|Good.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.|No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.|Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.|Well, thanks.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.|Well, you know.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.|[sad] Uh-huh.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.|Well no, but um.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.|Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
So, you feel like goin' for a run?|Alright.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.|OK. Just for a little while.
Ross kissed me.|Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
It was unbelievable!|Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
It was unbelievable!|Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?
Oh, it ended very well.|Oh.
Oh, it ended very well.|[getting the wine] Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
Oh, it ended very well.|Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.|Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.|Ohhhh.
And, uh, and then I kissed her.|Tongue?
Yeah.|Cool.
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.|Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
[doggedly] Games and stuff.|[reading the paper] There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
[doggedly] Games and stuff.|[reading over her shoulder] Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?
[doggedly] Games and stuff.|There's an ad for a naked chef?
[doggedly] Games and stuff.|No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... [rubs his fingers together]
Hi.|Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful|Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?|You got all that from saline solution?
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?|We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... [Rachel enters, carrying a tray]... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.|[to Ross] Hey, you.
How are you?|Good. How are you?
Hi, honey.|Hi, Julie. [nervous] Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Good.|[uncomfortable] Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
Good.|Oh, well, actually.
Good.|[impatient] Play it.
Good.|Ok, all right.
Good.|Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.
What?|[to Joey] Ssshh.
What?|Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night".
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.|So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Mockolate.|I'm sorry?
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.|Ohh.
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.|All right. Mmm-mmm.
Yeah?|[disgusted, trying not to show it] I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.|[still chewing] Mmm-mmm.
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.|Wow.
Aren't you going to swallow that?|Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Yeah, isn't that great?|[with false enthusiasm] Mmm.
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?|Abso...[swallows hard]...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Really?|Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
How about Mockolate mousse?|It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?|What makes it pilgrim?
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey.
Did uh, Ross call?|No, I'm sorry.
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."|No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.|Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.|Hey, here's a thought, Ross. [reaches for the computer]
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.|Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.|Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome.
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.|Can't we just use a pen?
No, Amish boy.|Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
No, Amish boy.|I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.
No, Amish boy.|You could say that.
No, Amish boy.|And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?|I don't know.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?|Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?|[long pause] She's not Rachel.
Oh my god.|Oh my god good?
[to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?|Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
[to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?|[in phone] So, Spock actually hugs his father?
Hey, do you guys have...[sees Ross, pauses]...hi.|Hi.
[sees his coat on] Where you goin'?|I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
[dejected] Oh.|No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Well, uh.|He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Well, uh.|Really?
Oh, god.|Ohhh.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.|I know, I know, it's, it's almost...[turns around, sees Chandler and Joey] What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Let me get my coat.|Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. [notices Chandler's computer screen] What's that?|[nervous] What? Nothing.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?|No, no, see? See? [the printer starts to run] Hey, it's printing. [to Joey, rattled] Hey, it's printing!
Hey, someone order a coat?|Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?|Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?|And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?|No!
He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?|Come on.
He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?|Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?
[through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."|That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
[through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."|All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.
[through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."|No, you don't.
[through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."|All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. [Rachel grabs the paper and runs across the room, reading it to herself.]
[through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."|What is this? Ross, what is this?
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?|Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.|Just a waitress?
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rachel?|Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.|She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.|You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.|I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.|Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.|What?
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.|What?
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.|This was your idea?
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.|What were you thinking?
[squirming] All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.|Yeah. You!
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?|Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Rachel! Whoops! Rachel, hey, open up, please!|[coldly] When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.|Not interested.
Number six: the way you smell.|[opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?|Oh, yeah, I do.
What are you doing out there?|I am, uh, I am...
What are you doing out there?|Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?
No.|No?
That's what I said.|Look, maybe we should go?
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.|Rachel, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
[near tears] No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.|No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. [to the others] I said don't go!|You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.|Doesn't matter.
What?|Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.|Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. [hands it to her] Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Well, uh, I ate some.|Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
Hi.|[to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Hi.|[to Ross] Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.
Look, can, can you do something for me?|Sure, what? Ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to Rachel] Music?
Hi, thanks for coming in again.|Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?|Cat hair.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?|Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?|Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?|And twenty-five it is.
You gave him cookies?|Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
You gave him cookies?|I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
You gave him cookies?|Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
You gave him cookies?|Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
You gave him cookies?|So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
You gave him cookies?|Uhh, the mailman, the super.
Oh my God.|What?
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.|Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.|Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.|Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Hey guys.|Hey.
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. [Rachel is not impressed]. . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. [sings] Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .|Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? [Rachel walks off] Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?|Yeah.
Hey guys.|Hey.
Hey guys.|What's in the bag?
Um, just some presents.|C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
[childishly] OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.|Cute.
Ross, that is gorgeous!|Yeah?
Hey.|Hey. Hi Phoebe.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get this?|Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.|Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.|Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.|How have you never been on Oprah?
[showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.|Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]|Oh, wait a minute honey.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]|Phoebs. [Phoebe leaves]
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]|Wow.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]|So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]|Joey!
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]|Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
Hi, Phoe.|Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Oh, just updating the phonebook.|Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
[nervously] Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?|Just, you know, to see... um.
Oh, sure, yeah. [gets a box with the pictures] This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.|OK, is this really my father?
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.|OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Look, I. . .|Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.|Oh God.
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.|Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.|OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Honey.|[realizes] Oh.
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. [pulls apart a frame and pulls a picture out] This is the real him.|Oh.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.|Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Hi.|Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
Hi.|No, nothin'.
I hope she's OK.|Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
How do you know exactly what she's going through?|She told us.
How do you know exactly what she's going through?|So whaddya got there Monica?
Just some stuff for the party.|Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?|Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?|Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. [hands her a smashed box]
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.|Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.|Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
C'mon Rachel.|OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.|Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]
Hey.|Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?|Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.|No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.|Whattaya mean?
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.|Wow. Thank you.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.|Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to a picture of Einstein]
Phoebe here with the cab yet?|Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.|Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Hey, here she comes.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.|Eeeshk.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.|Yeah, big stuff.
OK, let's go.|OK.
Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]|OK. [reads paper] Brake left, gas right?
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.|[grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]|[Chandler gets in the back seat] Hey!
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]|Hey. [Phoebe takes off, Joey and Chandler are thrown back in the seat]
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.|For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.|Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.|Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.|Ross, the heat!
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.|Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. [goes to the radiator and starts turning the knob] OK, this way is on, so this is. . . [breaks off the knob] off.
Did you just break the radiator?|No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
Did you just break the radiator?|Well put it back.
Did you just break the radiator?|It uhh, it won't go back.
I'll call the super.|Here, let me try.
I'll call the super.|Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
I'll call the super.|Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.

[answers door] Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.|[sitting at table talking to a girl] It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
[answers door] Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.|[carrying an ice cube tray] Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright.

No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.|Ross.
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.|Yeah.
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.|[to Ross] Looks like he's playin' baseball.
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.|You mean hardball?
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.|Whatever.
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.|What'cha gonna' do?
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.|Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?

OK.|How far'd ya get?
Mailbox.|Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Uh-huh.|Phoebs, what's goin' on?
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .|Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.|Well, so why not go knock?
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.|Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Yeah?|Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
Yeah?|Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.|Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.|Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!|Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!|Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!|Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!|Oh, I couldn't go in.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!|Honey, I'm sorry.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!|Are you OK?
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!|Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug, Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]|Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Rach, these are for you.|Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.|OK, Phoebs, your turn.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.|Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
Uh-huh.|You guuuyys.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|You got me a cola drink?
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|And, a lemon lime.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|And last but not least.
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.|I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.|You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was.
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.|Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject.
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.|Here it is, here it is. [reading from newspaper] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.|OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours.
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.|OK. [reading] The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.|Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours.
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.|I don't want to.
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.|Yeah.
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.|Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.|Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues.
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.|No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.|Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind. [Reads from paper] In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153...[turns it] sucking.
[sullenly] Hiiiiii.|Are... are you OK?
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?|Maybe.
Geller!|Hey, Fun Bobby!
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?|Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?|You and me both.
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?|Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?|No, I'm alright man. Really.
No, I'm picking you up.|Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? [everyone raises their hands] I'm still gonna go.|OK, I'll see you later babe.
See ya. [exits]|Bye! See you later!
See ya. [exits]|Fun Bobby is so great.
See ya. [exits]|Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.
See ya. [exits]|Half full of looooovvvvve.
See ya. [exits]|And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend.
See ya. [exits]|Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
See ya. [exits]|We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. [walks over to table, holding five empty wine bottles]
See ya. [exits]|Really? I only had two glasses.
See ya. [exits]|I just had a glass.
See ya. [exits]|Two.
See ya. [exits]|I had one glass.
See ya. [exits]|I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
See ya. [exits]|OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?
Oooooh.|[realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.
Oooooh.|So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.|Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.|Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.|Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.
rachel, does this have nonfat milk?|Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
[takes a sip] Mmmm, no.|Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
[takes a sip] Mmmm, no.|[pulls out a flask] Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?
Um, cake.|Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to counter.]
Um, cake.|You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
Um, cake.|Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.
Um, cake.|Bobby.
Um, cake.|Yeah, OK.
Um, cake.|Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.
Um, cake.|OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'
Um, cake.|So, what are you saying now?
Um, cake.|I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. [they hug]
[comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?|I am gonna try and quit drinking.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey.
Guess who's back in show business.|Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.|Oh, no.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.|Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.|Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|Hey rachel, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|[gasps] You have other friends?
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|What?
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|With a man?
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|What? What is so strange about me having a date?
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|What are you talking about?
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|But you guys came so close.
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.|[sounding like Ross] Hhhhiiiii.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?|Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?|No.
Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]|OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?|Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
What's the matter?|It's Fun Bobby.
What, isn't he sober?|Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]|Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Oh God, yes!|There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Oh God, yes!|That is funny.
Oh God, yes!|I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?|Oh yeah. See you guys. [leaves]
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?|Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
Oh.... my... God.|It's not that bad.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?|OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?|Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.|Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Hi.|[turning around] Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Hi.|Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?
Rachel? Um, hi.|Hi.
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?|Uhh.... waitressing?
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?|[looks at him] Huh, Bob Saget?
Oh, my, oh!|What? What's wrong?
I, OK....|She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
I, OK....|Alright.
I, OK....|[to Phoebe] Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK. [introducing Russ and Ross] Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.
I, OK....|Hi.
I, OK....|Hi.
I, OK....|Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?
I, OK....|Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?
I, OK....|Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.
I, OK....|A date.
I, OK....|Yeah, I'm her date.
I, OK....|Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.
I, OK....|You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.
I, OK....|Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.
I, OK....|Yes, yes I am. And you are a....
I, OK....|Periodontist.
I, OK....|See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
I, OK....|Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.
I, OK....|Ditto.
I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.|Oh.
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.|Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...|Well, yeah, this is the deal.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.|Um, Russ, you ready?
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.|Yeah.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.|Bye.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.|Bye.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.|Bye.
[upset] She's dating. She's dating.|Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
What do you mean?|Do you not see it?
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.|Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Hey.|Hey.
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.|Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Oh my God!|Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
[not knowing how to react] Oh my... God?|Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
So, what're you gonna do?|Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.|I've never slept with someone for a part.
Well is she... [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out, covered with pasta sauce]|Sorry.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?|Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.|I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?|Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Can I get you something from the bar?|Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank you.
Can I get you something from the bar?|If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.
Can I get you something from the bar?|No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it. [to waiter] Just some water.
Can I get you something from the bar?|So the light went out in my refrigerator...
Can I get you something from the bar?|[grabs waiter as he's leaving] I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.|Dysprosium.
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.|[condescendingly] Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?|What?
OK honey, you're dating Ross.|No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!|Steve... sleeve!
OK, noone is named Sleeve.|Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
[to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.|You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
[to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.|OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.
[to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.|I know what your problem is.
Oh you do, do you?|Um-hum, you're jealous.
Of... of what?|You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.|Hey, you listen.
No, no, let me finish.|No, let me finish.
Hi.|Hi.
Hi.|Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! [turns away]
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?|No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?|Me.
Why would I have to sleep with you?|It's my game. You want the job or not?
Hey.|Morning.
Hey.|Where ya goin'?
Hey.|Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?
Hey.|Ooooohhhh.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?|What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
What's with all the bottles of liquor?|Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.|Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
This is really hard for me to say.|Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Oh, no, no, it's about you.|What about me?
I think you may have a drinking problem.|What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?|Oh... shoot.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.|OK.
Take care.|You too.
What happened?|Well we... we kinda broke up.
What happened?|Awwwwwwww.
[holding bottles] Does anybody want these?|I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Hey.|Hey!
Hey.|How'd the callback go?
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.|So what'd you do?
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.|Good for you.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.|So... and?
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!|Allright!
Hi.|Oh, hey.
Hi.|Hi.
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.|Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.|Oh.
Hey.|Hey!
Hey.|Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!|So how did everything go?
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.|Well, we've gotta go.
Ok.|[clears her throat]
Ok.|Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us.
Oh, you and me?|Uh, no, Susan and me.
Oh, you and me?|The other us.
Ok.|We're uh, we're getting married.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?|Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.|Look I just thought that...
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!|Is your finger caught in that chair?
Mmm hmmm.|Want us to go?
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.|It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.|Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.|Yes!
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.|They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?
Would it matter?|Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!
Would it matter?|Are you really not going?
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?|They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
If you wanna call that a reason.|[singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
If you wanna call that a reason.|Ross, I thought you were over this.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|[entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|Whoa, she's pretty.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|I'm sorry, what?
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|What?
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|Oh, ok.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|Is she gonna be all right?
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|Nice!
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|That's great!
Excellent!|For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
That is so good! Do it again!|All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
That is so good! Do it again!|That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.
No no, that's me.|Oh, yeah.
Oh, hello.|Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Is everything ok?|Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Oh my god.|That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
Oh my god.|Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.
Oh my god.|Oh, honey.
Oh my god.|Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, "ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage." Little did she know God was thinking, "Ok, but that's it." Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.
Oh my god.|What do you mean?
Oh my god.|I think it went into me.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Ok, who ordered what?
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Oh god.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up!
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|[entering] There she is.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Mom!
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Pretty much.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Oh hello, Ross.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Oh Mom!
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Believe me, sometimes that happens.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Really?
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Yes.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.|Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
[laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.|I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.|For...me.
Well, not just for you.|Well, what do you mean?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|[entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|None.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|They didn't fight a lot?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|[Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Hey, look who's up.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|That's him.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Phoebe?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Um, do you wanna sit?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|You're saying, my wife is in you?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Everything?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Everything.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|[to Joey] Worth a shot, huh?
Look at this.|These are from Halloween three years ago.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|Um, you guys, you know when I said before, "thank you, but I don't really need your help"?
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|Actually, what I think you said was, "don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|Hey, Mon, you want some help?
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|If you want.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|[enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|She's still with you?
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?|God!
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?|All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?|Oh! What's new in sex?
The only man I've ever been with is your father.|I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.|Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
No.|You want me to talk you out of it?
No.|Then what? What do you want?
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.|Why on earth would I understand this?
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|Oh.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|Joey, speed it up!
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|Sir! No sir!
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|[to Ross] All right, you!
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called "pigs in Ross". All right, ball the melon.
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.
Hi.|How's it going?
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]|Fine, whatever.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]|What's the matter?
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]|Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]|What?
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|Oh my god.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|It's ok. I'm sorry.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|You do?
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|Of course I do.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|You're right. Of course you're right.
So we're back on?|We're back on.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.|Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Thank you.|Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]
Ross. [He lets her go]|You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Ross. [He lets her go]|[Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.
Would you look at them?|Yeah, can't help but.
Would you look at them?|[to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.
Would you look at them?|I miss Rose.
Would you look at them?|Oh, yeah?
Would you look at them?|I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.
Would you look at them?|You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?
Would you look at them?|Ok, that's so nice.
[to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]|Hey, Mom? Having fun?
[to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]|Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.
[to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]|There's more alcohol, right?
How you doin'?|Ok.
You did a good thing today.|Yeah.
You wanna dance?|No, that's fine.
Come on. I'll let you lead.|Ok.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?|Well, Mon, I was married.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?|Yeah, me, too, technically.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?|I had a wedding.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.|I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler]
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.|Isn't Ben in this?
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.|Oh, yeah!
That commercial always makes me so sad.|Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.|I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.|And the fact that they're both monkeys.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.|Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.|Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.|Rhythm?
No, my first fan mail.|Alright!
No, my first fan mail.|[reading] 'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
No, my first fan mail.|Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
No, my first fan mail.|This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.
Hey guys.|Hey.
Hey guys.|Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.|You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.|Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
I know, I know. [to Rob] Hello.|Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Hi Rob Dohnen.|I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
Oh, wow.|Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?|Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. [both laugh hysterically]
Hello.|It's Erica.
Hello.|Ah, the stalker.
Hello.|Never mind, it's open.
[Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.|Let's get out of here.
The one time they're not home.|OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.|She's comin'.
It's me.|Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
It's me.|Wait, wait, wait. [Opens the top of the dish soap he's holding]
Hi.|Erica.
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.|Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.|Oh my God, what happened?
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.|I can't believe this.
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.|Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.|Zoo dollars?
Ooohhh.|I know.
Ooohhh.|I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
Ooohhh.|Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?
Ooohhh.|Yeah.
Ooohhh.|Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
Ooohhh.|And she's not crazy?
Ooohhh.|Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
Ooohhh.|Oh my God.
Ooohhh.|Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
Ooohhh.|Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
Ooohhh.|You OK?
Ooohhh.|No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
Ooohhh.|That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
Ooohhh.|I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?
Ooohhh.|I was thinkin' about it.
Ooohhh.|OK. [they kiss] OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe
Ooohhh.|Hi Phoebe.
Ooohhh.|OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. [singing]
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?|Yeah it is. . . what?
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.|Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Who's they?|No one.
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.|Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?|Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you're good at that.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?|Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.|Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?|Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?|But that's what...
I should just be happy to be near you.|Hey I- [she cuts him off with a kiss]
Hey what?|That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! [she starts nibbling his hand] Hey. He-hey.
[singing] There'll be times when you get older|Excellent!
[singing] There'll be times when you get older|Very informative!
[singing] There'll be times when you get older|Not at all inappropriate!
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.|That was great, the kids loved you.
Yay, I rock.|And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
But.|How did you know there was a but?
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.|The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
I can do that.|Really?
Yeah.|Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.|Buddy, my monkey?
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.|Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?|That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?|That guy Lipson?
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?|No, I, I only know Lipson.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...|Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.|Of course.
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.|This is unbelievable.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?|Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Maybe.|But you already told me everything.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.|Well, so what're you gonna do?
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.|That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.|OK, hi again.
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.|Hi Phoebe.
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.|Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.|Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.|Well, there goes my whole belief system.
It's Erica.|Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
It's Erica.|No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.
It's Erica.|Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.
It's Erica.|Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?
It's Erica.|Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.
It's Erica.|Hey Erica, c'mon in.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?|Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?|Who?
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.|It's not what you think, that was...
You told me I was the only one. [throws a glass of water in his face]|Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?|Somebody wanna help me out here?
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?|Oh, I know, I know. [Turns on the TV. Joey in on it.]
How, how can you be here and there.|'Cause it's a television show.
Drake, what're you getting at?|I'm not Drake.
Drake, what're you getting at?|That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.
Is this true?|Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. [throws water in his face]
Is this true?|And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. [throws water in his face]
Is this true?|And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. [throws water in his face]
Is all this true?|Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
Oh Hans. [They kiss]|Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
Oh Hans. [They kiss]|Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care
I'll never forget you Hans. [Joey shuts the door in her face]|OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Fired! Why?|The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?|No.
I see.|Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?|I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.|You're kidding.
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.|This is amazing.
I know.|I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
I know.|OK, Rachel, I'm ready.
I know.|OK.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?|Um, yeah I guess that's me.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.|What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.|C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?|I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.|Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.|Ross, there he is.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. [guard lets them in]
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante. [Marcel grabs the elephant doll and throws it to the ground]
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Woah, dude, burn.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Woah.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|[to guys wering yellow isolation suits] So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|The one in the director's chair.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|We've got a problem.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Tell me.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Is it bad?
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|I'll talk to her.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|I hate actors.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|[to an extra in fatigues] Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.

Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.|What what what what?
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.|Ya think?
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?|No, was he any good in it?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.|Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Oh, yeah.|What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
He could hear me.|OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.|Excuse me. Hi.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.|Hi.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.|Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.|You don't think I'm cute?
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.|I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.|You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.|OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
Oh that's me, I gotta go.|Oh uh, o, OK.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.|Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.|No one was around to hear that?
So what'd he say?|Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Well, thanks anyway.|He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...|Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.|Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Does anybody need anything?|Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
That is so unfair.|I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.|You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.|Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.|Stick a fork what?
Like, when you're cooking a steak.|Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?|Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'|What did you say?
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?|Oh, you just know.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.|Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?|Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.|You want me to wear your panties?
Could ya?|Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.|Oooh.
With mealworms.|Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.|Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. [Monica starts making faces behind her back] She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|That is the most ridiculous.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|You sold me out.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|I did not sell you out.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|Yes you did. Absolutely.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|Did you just flick me?
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]

Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|Ow, you stop flicking.
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|You flicked me first.
Ow. Ow. Ow.|Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Ow. Ow. Ow.|Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?
Ow. Ow. Ow.|Uh-huh.

Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this. [she leaves with his clothes]|Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? [he nods] Can you beat up that guy?|Sure.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.|Normally, I would not do it.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?|'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
Say you're sorry.|No. [hitting each other]
Say it.|No. [hitting again]
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.|OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
Say you're sorry.|OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play. [She grabs a jar of tomato sauce and Monica's purse]
What're you gonna do?|You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
You don't have the guts.|Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.|I'll help you fix your sweater.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.|I'll help you throw out your purse.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.|I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.|Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.|I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves [pulls Rachel's gloves out of her purse]
Joey?|Ma?

Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.|Are you naked in there?
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.|Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
No, no, this is the first time.|Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.|Well, let me see.

It's James Bond.|Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
It's James Bond.|The head tilt?
It's James Bond.|Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. [demonstrating] 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
It's James Bond.|I'm sorry.
It's James Bond.|No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. [demonstrates] 'I'm OK.' [tilts head] 'You sure?' [bobs head] 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
It's James Bond.|[her and Phoebe tilt their heads] Oh, that's too bad.

I am not.|Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.|So. You two are totally into each other.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.|OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.|Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.|I told you there was going to be sub-titles.

Honey, I'm just checking.|Oh.
Monica.|Mon.
Monica.|Mon.

And that's, that's funny why?|Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.|OK. [start kissing again and Rachel starts lauging again]
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.|I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.|Just one cheek.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.|Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
That's romantic.|C'mon touch it.
No.|Oh, come on squeeze it.

Stop sending food to our apartment.|What? You have a date? Who with?
No one.|C'mon, what's his name?
Nothing.|Come on, tell me.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.|Oh, I promise, what.
It's Richard Burke.|Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.|Doctor Burke is sexy?
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.|Oh God, absolutely.

When?|Well maybe he was nervous.
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.|It's OK, it's fine.
Wow, is that Michelle?|Yep.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.|Ya know, she's having another baby.
I thought she just had one.|No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Oh, you're a grandpa.|Yeah. Are we nuts here?
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.|I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Yeah.|So.
So maybe we should just. . .|Yeah, yeah, maybe.
Wow, this really sucks.|Yeah, it sure does. [they hug and it turns into a passionate kiss]
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?|No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Pizza delivery.|Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.

You're not laughing.|This time it's not so funny.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.|What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Hi.|Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.|What?
Is that the fire alarm?|Yeah. [feels the floor] Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?|That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Waaa-aaah.|What?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.|Yeah, so.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?|Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.|Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.|Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
Hey.|Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
Hey.|Ahh.
Hey.|[enters from her room] OK, ready when you are.
Hey.|Okey-doke.
Hey.|I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?|Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?|Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?|Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?|So where you gettin' it?
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?|I think on my shoulder. [Ross enters]
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?|What? What's on your shoulder?
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?|Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?|A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? [to Rachel] Hi.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?|Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?|No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?|Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?|Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?|Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?|Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?|No, I think you should tell them.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?|No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?|I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
Alright, shall we?|OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.|Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.|Happy birthday dad.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.|Oh thank you.
Hi ma.|Happy birthday.
Hi ma.|Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
Well, you kids take the train in?|No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. [Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]|Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. [Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]|Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. [Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]|Are we still on that?
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. [Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]|We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
Can you believe this place?|I know, this is a great apartment.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.|Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.|Hey.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.|Thanks. You want it?
Huh?|Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?|Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?|[being left behind] Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
C'mon, tell us.|Yeah, is she really 20.
C'mon, tell us.|I am not telling you guys anything.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.|Dad, you really don't want to do that.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?|Jack, would you let it go?
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.|Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .|Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?|Well I. . .
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.|Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
Here we go.|[reluctantly] Uh-huh.
You're not going?|Uh-huh.
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?|No. Well, yeah, maybe.
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?|What's 1922?
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?|Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?|No.
OK, who is the boss of you?!!|You?
How ya doin'?|I'm a twinkie.
Really? I'm a hero.|Oh, this is so hard.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.|Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
My parents are dead.|God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.|Alright.
[walks out of the bathroom and runs into Mrs. Geller who is going to the bathroom] Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.|Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.|I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.|I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.|Really.
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.|So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.|[they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.|Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.|Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.|What?
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.|Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.|Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Well that's how I feel.|Well then maybe you should take it.
Well then maybe I will.|Fine with me.
Who's drink can I freshen?|Almost time for cake.
Who's drink can I freshen?|Mon, Mon, are you OK?
Who's drink can I freshen?|You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
Who's drink can I freshen?|Yeah.
Who's drink can I freshen?|Well, I just caught the live show.
Who's drink can I freshen?|Eww.
Hey there.|What?
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.|Humm, really?
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?|Uhh, not that I know of.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?|That - that's an idea.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?|Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
Oh?|Oh?
Oh?|Ohh.
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?|Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
So, who's the mystery man?|Well, uh, he's a doctor.
A real doctor?|No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]
Well that's wonderful. . . I|Mom, it's OK.
Well that's wonderful. . . I|It is Judy.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!|[enters with his bat] Found it.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!|I'll take that dad. [grabs the bat]
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.|That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.|Dad, I'm the twinkie.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.|You're the twinkie?
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.|She's not a twinkie.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.|Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
Oh please, a relationship.|Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Oh please, a relationship.|Really?
Oh please, a relationship.|Yes.
Oh please, a relationship.|Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
Oh please, a relationship.|Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
Oh please, a relationship.|When did I say that?
Oh please, a relationship.|Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.|I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.|Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
Oh OK. [pulls over her shirt and shows a bare shoulder] Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.|You didn't get it?
No.|Why didn't you get it?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.|Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?|Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .|Yeah me too.
I know. Yeah.|Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
No, we're alright.|So I got ya something. [tosses Joey a bag of plastic spoons]
Plastic spoons. Great.|Lick away my man.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.|What?
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.|No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
I'm movin' out like we talked about.|Well I didn't think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.|Well, there you go.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.|Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?|I did pay for half of it.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.|Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.|Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
So, are you sorry that I told them?|No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Oh.|Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.

What? You didn't get one.|What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
What? You didn't get one.|OK, that's my tattoo.
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.|OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. [she bends over and bears her tattoo right when Ross returns]|You got a tattoo?
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.|Lemme see. [looks]
Well?|Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Really?|Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
I guess.|Hey, save us some pizza. [they go off to Rachel's room]
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.|Stop talkin' to your men. [Joey scores]
Yes! And the table is mine.|Congratulations. [Chandler leaves]
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?|Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . [Chandler gives him a look] except when we are here.
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?|I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.

Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.|So what're you gonna do?
Well, I can't work with people who would do this.|Sure.

I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?|What?
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?|There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
So what happens next?|Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
So what happens next?|God that is good TV.
Phoebs, play with meeee.|No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.|Why don't you play with your roommate?
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.|Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.|Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
We don't need to remedy that.|Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]
We don't need to remedy that.|What was that?
We don't need to remedy that.|Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
We don't need to remedy that.|Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
We don't need to remedy that.|Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.

Page 42, page 42, page 42.|Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Ooh, I look good.|Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'|Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?|Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.|Right. Could you sign this?
No. No way, I'm not signing that.|I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
How can they do this to me?|Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.|Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.|G'night.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.|Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.|Two.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?|Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom]|Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.|Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Uhhhooo.|C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Well, there's you.|Better not be doin' these in order.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.|Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.|Really?
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.|That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.|Where's Buddy?
Buddy?|My fish, Buddy.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.|Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?|Well yeah.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.|You really ok with it?
Oh honey, I'm fine.|Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
What? Alright, what about my two?|Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Right, and...|And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.|But you've only slept with two people.
Right.|Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.|Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...|Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.|Knock-knock.
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.|Until now. [jumps on Rachel on the bed]

It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.|Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.|Why?
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.|Why would you kill his fish?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.|Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? [they turn on the TV]

Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.|Wow.

Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.|No.
No, 'cause he's yummy.|Yes. But all the other ones.
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.|Anybody want a croan.
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.|So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?|No, can we get back to me?
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.|Alright. Cab driver number two?
You're welcome.|But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Things change, roll with em.|But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.|I'm sorry. See ya.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.|Isn't it.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.|I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.|Hey you guys.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.|Hey.

NO!|No?
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?|Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.|You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.|Excuse me, your, your, your wind?
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?|You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.|Um-um, um-um.
What is it?|I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.|What, what's that?
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.|Open it, open in.
Oh my God.|Woah.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?|Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Ahh.|What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.|Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
What?|That audition.
That's a two line part.|Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
So what.|So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.|Toilet paper?
Yeah.|Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.|I am your friend.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'|But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.|Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.|Huh, I'm just saying...

Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.|Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!|Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...

Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. [walks out the door and after a pause comes back in] But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!|You want some help.
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.|Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
What?|Five oh dollars.
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.|That's great.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.|Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.

Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.|Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.|Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.|You're meeting Richard?
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.|Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.|Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.|Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.|You hear that? We're the guys.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.|We're the guys.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.|With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.|No luck huh?
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.|Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length]
What're you doing?|Uh, I'm holding Ben.
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.|Ok.
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.|This is how I would hold a football.
Ok, here, here. There we go.|Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
It's alright, it's no big deal.|Really?
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.|What?
What?|You think about stuff like that?
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.|Two, two babies?
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.|Then what's gonna happen?
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.|Uh-huh.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.|Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Huh?|I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? [leaves]
Hey.|Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.|So you watched the movies huh?
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.|Charlotte who?
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.|Alright, you wanna feel better?
Yeah.|Ok, here, watch this.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.|So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.|Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|[runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.

Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|It's the basketball playoffs.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|Uh, it's the college playoffs.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|Oh, then go Vassar.

Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|Ok, then just go.
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|Ok. [leaves]
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
Sure.|It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.|[enters] Aghh.
Me too. [leaves]|I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Me too. [leaves]|Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
Me too. [leaves]|Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
Me too. [leaves]|[enters] Ok, what the hell happened back there?
Me too. [leaves]|I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
Me too. [leaves]|Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
Me too. [leaves]|Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
Me too. [leaves]|C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
Me too. [leaves]|Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
Me too. [leaves]|No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
Me too. [leaves]|What was the book?
Me too. [leaves]|The big book of childrens' names.
Me too. [leaves]|Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
Me too. [leaves]|Yeah.
Me too. [leaves]|But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
Me too. [leaves]|Ok fine.
Me too. [leaves]|Thank you.
Me too. [leaves]|We're not done.
Me too. [leaves]|I didn't know that.
Me too. [leaves]|Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
Me too. [leaves]|Fine, I will.
Me too. [leaves]|Good, 'cause I love you.
Me too. [leaves]|Oh yeah.
Me too. [leaves]|Yeah.
Me too. [leaves]|Well I love you too.
Me too. [leaves]|Well that's the first time we've said that.
Me too. [leaves]|Yes it is.
Me too. [leaves]|Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
Me too. [leaves]|Well you better.
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.|Did you like it?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.|Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Kick save and... denied.|But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Kick save and... denied.|Man you are incredible.
Kick save and... denied.|Well, we had a table in college.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.|Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.|[enters] Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.|Ok, just one more point.
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.|[grabs the other two bars on Richard's side and scores] Score! Now can we go?

Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.|Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.

Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.|[pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. [starts the tape again]
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.|Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|Ok honey, you really need a job.

Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|Ahh.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|His indian name?
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|Freakish.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|Wow.
Freaky.|Weird, weird.
Freaky.|Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?

No?|Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat.
No?|Why should we?
No?|Because it's a special hat. [Chandler looks at Ross funny] See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler...
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?|You got a problem with that?
Hey, how'd the interview go?|It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?

Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.|Yeah, I don't know.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.|What's the matter?
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.|I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.|Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?|Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
[innocently] What was that?|Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.|Time is money my friend?
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.|Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?|Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?|How did you make $17.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.|How come those?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.|What happened to uh, MEG.?
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.|That is so not my motto.

MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.|Good.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.|Oh, thank God.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.|Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.|Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.|I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.|Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it.
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.|Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. [goes over and grabs the phone that's sitting by Monica]
DON'T...be too long with the phone.|She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.

Heavy.|Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
No but he didn't really talk about anything.|Oh.
Except stilts.|Stilts?
Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.|Wow.
Yeah.|I don't know what to do with that.
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.|Yeah.
This is huge, you can buy me beer.|I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'

Look at her.|Guys guys, check this out.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.|Ohhh.
What?|Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?|Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?|Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?|Yeah.
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?|Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.|Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|Why not her?
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|Joey that is horriable.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
Hi honey, how did it go?|Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Hi honey, how did it go?|Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
Hi honey, how did it go?|Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
Hi honey, how did it go?|So what happened?
Hi honey, how did it go?|My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
Hi honey, how did it go?|Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
Hi honey, how did it go?|Well, how bout just her mom?
Hi honey, how did it go?|Why her mom?
Hi honey, how did it go?|Cause I already invited her.
Hi honey, how did it go?|Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
Hi honey, how did it go?|Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.

No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.|I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.|This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.|So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.|Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.|Alright, that sounds like a two person job. [they walk into Rachel's bedroom]
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.|Well, my goodness, what was that?
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.|You thought I was Rachel?
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.|Yes because uh, you look so young.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.|And because you're both, you know, white women.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.|Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.|NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.|Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. [Chandler takes the hot pink coat and grimaces at it] Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... [Chandler, remembering that Joey and Mr. Greene are in the bedroom, throws her coat in a cupboard] The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...[Joey peeks out]
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.|[cutting Mrs. Greene off] Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. [they go in the bathroom]

So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.|Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.|Right this is staging.
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.|Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.|[as they're walking out, Dr. Greene questioningly gestures at the Happy Birthday sign over the door] This is clearly in the wrong apartment. [they all walk across the hall]
Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment] Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.|Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? [buzzer goes off] Alright that's Ross.

I do.|That's who.
I do.|Look, are you gonna be ok?
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.|Well, actually just one birthday flan.
What?|It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.|Quick volleyball question.
Volleyball.|Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.|Dennis.

Ok, that's me. [runs back]|Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?

Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. [she demonstrates, Gunther starts to walk to the door] Gunther, where're you going?|I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...

Oh hello Ross, where have you been?|Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? [walks out in the hallway, Mr. Greene is walking out of Chandler and Joey's apartment] Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.|No. no.
Whad'ya mean no?|No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Get my glasses too.|All righty roo. [closes the door] What a great moment to say that for the first time. [goes to get the cigarettes and glasses]
Get my glasses too.|Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
Get my glasses too.|Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
Get my glasses too.|What? [she runs over to where Phoebe is, Phoebe signals for Gunther to go] I don't see anything.
Get my glasses too.|Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
Get my glasses too.|Ross, whose glasses are those?
Get my glasses too.|Mine.
Get my glasses too.|You wear bi-focals?
Get my glasses too.|Um-hmm. [puts them on] I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
Get my glasses too.|Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
Get my glasses too.|Well those are very popular frames.
Get my glasses too.|Neil Sedaka wears them.
Get my glasses too.|[to Phoebe] I hear you can get people out of here.
Get my glasses too.|Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
Get my glasses too.|Yeah, like a chimney.
Get my glasses too.|Ohh, big smoker. [Packs the cigarettes and flings one on Mrs. Greene in the process. Finally gets one in his mouth and it look really out of place] Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. [as he walks into the hall, he comes face to face with Mr. Greene]
Are you wearing my glasses?|Yes. [pulls them off and hands them to Mr. Greene] I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?|[pulls the cigarette off his upper lip and hands it to Mr. Greene] Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.|What about my friend Victor?
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.|Alright, let me just get my coat.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.|Is it true they have beer?
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?|Um [gestures to dance floor]
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?|[enters with the three people she got out] Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
Phoebe.|Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
You want me to see a therapist?|Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.|Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...|He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
...and you sand it and you varnish it...|...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...|...the scotch and the cigarettes...
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...|...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
[running out of his apartment after a girl] Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. [sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.|This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.|Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?|It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.|Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
Ok will do. So glad you came.|I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.|Oh ok.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.|Happy birthday sweetie.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.|Ok.
Ahh, you drive safe.|Ross, what're you doing.
Ahh, you drive safe.|I'm getting ready for the water skiing. [Mr. Greene opens the door which pulls Ross in] How are you doing?
Ahh, you drive safe.|Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
Ahh, you drive safe.|To get my coat.
Ahh, you drive safe.|No no no.
Ahh, you drive safe.|Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.|Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there] Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.|I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.|Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.|Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. [grabs her and kisses her to distract her. She goes limp in his arms. Mr. Greene leaves.] Well, ok, you take care.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.|Oh, you kids [she caresses his face and chest] Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.|Thank you.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.|Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.|Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
Ok, that's enough.|Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Ok, that's enough.|Ok, I've got one. [blows out the candles. Somebody calls out 'heads up' and the volleyball lands in the flan] Wow, those things almost never come true.
Oh, I ordered mine first.|Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Give it to me.|No.
Give it to me.|Ok, you can have it. [He licks it and offers it to her.]
[She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.|That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]
[She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.|[enters] Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
[Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.|Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
You went out with a guy in the Navy?|Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
You went out with a guy in the Navy?|Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
You went out with a guy in the Navy?|No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.|[enters] Hiii.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.|Oh no, what happened?
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.|Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.|Oh no.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.|Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.|Well I've had it.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.|Yeah, I've had it.
Had it.|Had it.
Had it.|Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. [Sees a red bump on her arm.] Oh look!
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.|Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?|Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
What're you doing?|Just waiting for you sweetie.
Are you remaking the bed?|I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Then, you're redoing it because...|If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.|Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Oh, well that's not so crazy.|I'm just easing you in.
Oh, alright.|Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.|Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.|But don't you need experience for a job like that?
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.|[enters] Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.|No kidding.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.|Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.|Where do you work?
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.|Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.|Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.|Ha-ha. [Scott leaves] Are all you processors dorks?
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.|You look fabulous honey, you really do.
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.|Yeah? Are you sure, really. [She picks up a mirror and sees the white splotches all over her face.]
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.|I, I, I'm hideous.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.|It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
Come in.|Hey baby, I'm back... [Phoebe is sitting by the window in a veil.]
Hey Ryan, what's up?|What's goin' on?
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.|Chicken or small?
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.|Why aren't you at home in bed?
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.|I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
Ohh, ohh.|If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.|Can I please see your face?
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.|Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.|Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.|Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. [He walks to her and kisses her.]
Hey.|Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.|Well there you go.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.|Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?|Weird world. Your kids?
I figure my character has kids.|Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.|Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.|Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
You know what makes the itching even worse?|That you don't stop talking about it.
Fine.|Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes, here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
What're you doing? Are you scratching?|No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
You're scratching. Give me the dice.|No.
Give me the dice.|No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.|Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]
No.|Give it.
No.|Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. [She starts scratching him.]
Oh God help me.|Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.|You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.|Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.|Bye bye Joey.
What a phony.|Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Sir.|Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Sir.|Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
Sir.|I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?|It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
Yeah Bing, what's that about?|Rough numbers?
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.|Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.|Uh, if you say so sir.
Joseph's good, isn't he?|Well, I'm going to kill you.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.|Why?
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?|This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
You're strict.|It's for their own good.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.|Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.|Very good.
Thank you.|You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
You're gonna do what to my clocks.|I'm gonna set them to my time.
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.|No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.|No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
No come on. Come on tell me.|No. See you don't understand.
Come on.|No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
No that's not true. That is not true.|Oh yeah.
Yeah.|Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.|What if they get mixed up?
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.|You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.|Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.|Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.|Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.|I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.|Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Karen.|Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.|Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Really?|No freakshow, she's fictional.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.|Thank you.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.|No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.|[Comes out of the bathroom, also with oven mits on his hands.] Well that wasn't easy.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.|Ok, dinner's on.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.|And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.|Alright you kids, bye now.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.|Bye. [waving]
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.|Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
Wine?|Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mits.]
Oh, I spilled some.|I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.]
[Puts his hands over Phoebe's ears.] I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.|What?
Sorry. You look beautiful.|Oh.
Monica, wake up. Monica.|What's up?
I thought of a thing.|Yeah?
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.|No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.|No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.|Alright, go on.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.|Oh my God, you're a freak.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?|I really can't say.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?|So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?|I can't say.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.|I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.|Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.|I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.|Ok, I'll walk you out.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.|Bye Ryan.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.|Pleasure.
It was nice to meet you.|Take care.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?|You like that do ya?
Oh yeah.|I'll make some calls. [Runs off.]
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?|I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. [They kiss.]
Taxi.|Bye you. [Ryan's cab drives off. As Phoebe is going back in, she sees the Central Perk sign in the window and laughs.]
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.|Is this what you had in mind?
I'm shipping out tomorrow.|Well then uh, we better make this night count. [He starts to carry her out.] Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. [He carries her over to turn it off.] Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. [He carries her to the counter to pick up her purse.] Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|Who?
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|Wow!
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|'Cause he was just so darn cute.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.  Or you just do it.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|I did do it, I'm a professional.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|Then what's the problem?
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing  Ooh.
Hey, what did your agent say?|Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Hey, what did your agent say?|What, forget it!
Hey, what did your agent say?|Yeah, right.
Hey, what did your agent say?|Come on, I need your help here.
Hey, what did your agent say?|All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
Hey, what did your agent say?|You see this, this is a friend.
Hey, what did your agent say?|Uh-huh, let's go.  Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
Hey, what did your agent say?|Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
Hey, what did your agent say?|Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
Hey, what did your agent say?|Yeah, that makes sense.
Hey, what did your agent say?|Over my dead body!
Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.|Oh my God, you look so good!
Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.|I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.

Get out!|Afraid to ask him?
Get out!|Could not be more terrified.
Get out!|Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
Where's Benny, there he is.|Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.|Okay.
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?|Sure I do.
Yeah, am I in it?|Honey, you are in it.
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.|Oh, yeah!
Keep talkin'.|Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?|Like a hound?
Not a basset, a bassinet.|You really need the bassinet?
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.|Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.

Hey!|What does she mean by HH?
Hey!|It means we're holding hands.
Hey!|Are you the cutest?
Hey!|I'm afraid I might just be.
Hey!|You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
Hey!|Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
Hey!|It could be like a big giant guy.
Hey!|and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
Hey!|We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
Hey!|Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
Hey!|How do you not fall down more?
Hey!|Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
Hey!|All right.  "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
Hey!|Well at least we know she's a woman.
Hey!|I can't believe she's married.
Hey!|Aw, man I'm sorry .
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.|Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.|Neither am I.
Hey, there.|Hi.
Are you all right?|Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.|God I know, you're right.

Why the hell didn't you tell me!|I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.|Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.|Rachel!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.|It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.

I want you to say that you like her!|I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Thanks for trying.  Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!|Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
How could you have told her?|Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.|Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.|Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.|Were both of those Joey?
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.|Not even with your best friend.
Noo!|That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?|Pretty much.
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?|Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.|Richard's living room, drinking wine.

Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.|All right, I'll try not to.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....|Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....|I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....|Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
So, I hear, you hate me!|I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.|And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.|But what does that gonna do...
For Chandler!|Okay. I'm in.
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'|Does it have to be a whole day?
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.|Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.|Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Uh, huh.|Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
Uh, huh.|Umm, yeah.

Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...|Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...|Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.
All right! You can have the chair.|Really!
Oh my, would you look at that!|Is that too spooky?
Oh my, would you look at that!|"Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
Oh my, would you look at that!|What?!
Oh my, would you look at that!|Nevermind.
Oh my, would you look at that!|"Monica, it's Richard. Call me."
Oh my, would you look at that!|Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?!
Oh my, would you look at that!|It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
Oh my, would you look at that!|What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
Oh my, would you look at that!|Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
Oh my, would you look at that!|Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
Oh my, would you look at that!|Huh?
Oh my, would you look at that!|I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay.  There we go, there we go.
Oh my, would you look at that!|You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here.
Oh my, would you look at that!|Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
Oh my, would you look at that!|Sorry Phoebe.
I'm so sorry.|What am I gonna do?
I'm so sorry.|No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't!  What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
I'm so sorry.|Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
I'm so sorry.|If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
I'm so sorry.|Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
I'm so sorry.|Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
I'm so sorry.|So, should I call him back?
I'm so sorry.|Noo!  NO!
I'm so sorry.|All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair.  I'm soooo, comfortable.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|All right!
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|Pheebs, what happened?
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|Hummus. I got the hummus.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|That won't go with this dress though.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|I called him.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|Nooo.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?|I know the code to his answering machine.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?|Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
Monica, how are you gonna do that?|"Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."
Monica, how are you gonna do that?|"You have two new messages."
Wow, what a cool job.  'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'|"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.|Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.|Monica, you don't know that.
Well, who's voice was that?|Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?|Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Okay.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|What are you doing?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|The cushions are the essence of the chair!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|That's right! I'm taking the essence.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.

It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|We used them as pillows when we went camping.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|What?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|The sheep.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Hey, what you do on your own time...
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Where's my underwear?!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|He took my essence!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Hey, opposite, is opposite!

It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Okay, I'm ready.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Oh, aaaah!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|What are you supporting?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Duh!! Christmas!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.  What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Just, just, just pick one!
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|But I...
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|All right.

Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.|Hola! Hello. Hello?
Okay. That was her right?|Definitely.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.|Yay!
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.|I'll get it, okay.  Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....|You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.|No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Okay, fine.|They got a phone in there, right?
Okay, fine.|Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
Okay, fine.|Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
Okay, fine.|I'm not gonna gooo.
Okay, fine.|You're not going to go.
Okay, fine.|No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
Okay, fine.|How, how, um how can you not be going?
Okay, fine.|I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
Okay, fine.|Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
Okay, fine.|Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
Okay, fine.|Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
Okay, fine.|It's fine.
Okay, fine.|No, but, your-your mad.
Okay, fine.|I'm not mad.
Okay, fine.|No.
Okay, fine.|I'm just not going.
Okay, fine.|Your not going.
Okay, fine.|Right.
Okay, fine.|Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
Okay, fine.|Um, hum.
Okay, fine.|Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
Okay, fine.|No.
Okay, fine.|No, because your not upset.
Okay, fine.|Right.
Okay, fine.|About the yelling.
Okay, fine.|Right, and the humiliating.
Okay, fine.|Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
Okay, fine.|Um, hum.
Okay, fine.|We're good.
Okay, fine.|Right.
Okay, fine.|Okay. Honey?
Okay, fine.|Yes, Ross.
Okay, fine.|I love you.
Okay, fine.|She's just getting dressed.
Okay, fine.|Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
Okay, fine.|Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
Okay, fine.|Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
Okay, fine.|Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
Okay, fine.|Oooo-ooh!
Okay, fine.|Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
Okay, fine.|Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
Okay, fine.|Jeez, what a baby.
Okay, fine.|Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
Okay, fine.|You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
Okay, fine.|You could drink the fat.
Okay, fine.|Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
Okay, fine.|No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
Okay, fine.|What?
Okay, fine.|I think you should drink the fat.
Okay, fine.|Yaaaay!
Okay, fine.|Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
Okay, fine.|Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
Okay, fine.|I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
Okay, fine.|No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
Okay, fine.|You will?!
Okay, fine.|You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
Okay, fine.|Well, yeah.
Okay, fine.|You were gonna drink the fat.
Okay, fine.|Let's see what else he'll do!
Okay, fine.|You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
Okay, fine.|Stop it. Stop it!
Okay, fine.|Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
Okay, fine.|Hi, this is Richard.
Okay, fine.|You have three new messages.
Not any more!|Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.|Your outgoing message has now been changed.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!|How did you do that?
I don't know!|Good-bye.
Noooo!!!!|Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.|Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.|Rachel!!  Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.|And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay, that was about seven seconds.
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.|So we're a little late.
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.|Come on.  Oh! And, uh, by the way....
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.|What?
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.|I'm going commando, too.
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.|Awwww!!!
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|Wow! What a pleasure.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|Excuse me. Hi.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|Yes?
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|What do you mean, your seat?
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|I mean, I was sitting there.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|But, you got up!
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|But, I never left the room!
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|But, you left the chair area.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|All right, that's it, give me your underwear.
WHOAA!!|See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.|Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.|I didn't know there were docks.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|Aww, is it broken?
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.|Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.|Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
What is this? Fruit?|Monica's making jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?|Because the kids need new shoes.
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?|I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.|You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
What?|One more chance Ursula, please?
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.|Wh..
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.|Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Oh, you're not a dingus.|I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.|Well thanks.
Wait,  you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?|Not really.
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.|Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?|Yeah, okay.
Okay.  Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.|Sorry.
Mon?|Mon?
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'|Wait a minute, look.
What?|Look, look, look.
What, what, what?|It's an empty apartment.
Oooh.|We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes|There it is.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey.|Hey.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey.|Do I look fat?
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey.|Noo.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey.|Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.|Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.|Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
Nooo!|And it works both ways.
Nooo!|Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.|Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.|That's easy, baggage claim.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.|Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.|Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work.|Oh.
All right are you guys gonna come down?|Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Good luck Chandler.|Thank you Rachel.
Good luck Chandler.|Bye sweetie.
Bye hon.|Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Bye hon.|Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
Bye hon.|Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed...
Bye hon.|Yeah.
Bye hon.|I'm gonna use the cushion.
Bye hon.|Yeah.
Bye hon.|Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
Bye hon.|Okay, the old hug and roll.
Bye hon.|Yep.
Bye hon.|Okay, one question.
Bye hon.|Shoot.
Bye hon.|You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?|You're so pretty.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?|Hi!
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?|Hey, Phoebe.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?|Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?|Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?|Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?|Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?|Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?|No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
|Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
|Hey guys.
|Hey Mon.
|Joey, this is for you.  It's blackberry curin.
Aww.  Ohh!|Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked
Put your hands together.|Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
No more jam?!|Well, what happened to your jam plan?
No more jam?!|I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
No more jam?!|Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
No more jam?!|What are you talking about?
No more jam?!|I'm talking about me having a baby.
No more jam?!|What?
No more jam?!|Are you serious?
No more jam?!|Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
No more jam?!|Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
No more jam?!|It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
No more jam?!|That, that's what's stupid.
No more jam?!|I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
No more jam?!|Down at the docks again?
Night-night Bing-a-ling.|Night-night.....Janice.
Here's my binoculars.|Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.|Oh, yeah. What's this?
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?|Um, not even a little bit.
It's about you.|Oh, okay then.
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.|Good. So what were you thinking?
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.|Really?
No.|Oh.
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.|Oh, okay.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.|Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
You mean there's more than one of us.|Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
You mean there's more than one of us.|You're gonna what?
You mean there's more than one of us.|I'm gonna tell Mom.
You mean there's more than one of us.|Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
You mean there's more than one of us.|Crazy.
You mean there's more than one of us.|What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
You mean there's more than one of us.|Oh, it's not the ideal way...
You mean there's more than one of us.|Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
You mean there's more than one of us.|Check it out!! Jam crackers!
You mean there's more than one of us.|Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy.  Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'
You mean there's more than one of us.|Yeah, the Knicks rule!
You mean there's more than one of us.|Joey, this is you!
You mean there's more than one of us.|Let me see.  Oh, right.
You mean there's more than one of us.|When did you go to a sperm bank?
You mean there's more than one of us.|Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
And that's how you bought it?|Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
And that's how you bought it?|Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
And that's how you bought it?|Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
And that's how you bought it?|Hellooo!
And that's how you bought it?|Hey.
And that's how you bought it?|How's the maniac?
And that's how you bought it?|Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
And that's how you bought it?|Phoebe, what are you doing?
And that's how you bought it?|Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
And that's how you bought it?|Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
And that's how you bought it?|Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
And that's how you bought it?|You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
And that's how you bought it?|What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.|What are you saying I should do?
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.|I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.|Thank you, Monica.
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.|Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.|Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
Oh my God, what happened?|Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.|Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
Ross's what?|You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
Phoebe?|Yes? Yes! Oh.
What are you doing?|Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Were you following me?|Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.|Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.|No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know  Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Uh-huh, I don't know.|Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Hey.|Hey.
Where you going?|To the bank.
Sperm or regular?|Sperm.
So you're really doing this, huh?|Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Sounds nice.|'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
No kiddin', hmm.|What?
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.|Really? Why?
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.|Hoyt?
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.|Really, is he a swimmer?
He's got the body for it.|I like that.  What?
You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.|We do not have one of those signs.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.|Two girls and a boy?
Yeah!|And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too.|Yeah.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person.|Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Did I get it?|Yeah.
Did I get it?|Hello.
Did I get it?|Hello.
Did I get it?|Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?
Did I get it?|Sure. What's up?
Did I get it?|Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk!

Well, it's official there are no good movies.|Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.|Perhaps, you would like me to turn like this,  so that you can bunny bump against my back.
Well, it's official there are no good movies.|Hey!
Well, it's official there are no good movies.|Hey.
Hey, man. What's up?|Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|How is it you?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|Yep, that's my audition.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|See, now this is why I keep notepads everywhere.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|Yep, and that's why we don't invite you to play.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh .
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|What, what are you doing? What are you doing?
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh.  'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|Hang up, hang up.
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|'Annie! Hi. Listen we got a problem with Joey Tribbiani, apparently he missed his audition. Who did you speak to in my office? Estelle, no, I don't know what I'm going to do with her. No. All right, so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment, the world does not stop.'
Is anybody else scared?|
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!|Oh, now you want a pad.
Hey!!|There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi  What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Hey!!|He picked it out of the toy store himself, he loves it.
Hey!!|He carries it everywhere, it's like a security blanket, but with ski boots and a kicky beret.
Hey!!|Yeah, it's, it's, it's cute. Why, why, why does he have it, again?
Hey!!|So he's got a doll? So what? Unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up and be in show business.
Hey!!|This doesn't have anything to do with the fact that he is being raised by two women, does it?
Hey!!|You know what it's fine. If you're okay with the Barbi thing, so am I.
Hey!!|Give daddy the Barbi! Ben, give, give me the Barbi. Okay, how 'bout, don't you want to play with the monster truck?
Hey!!|Ross, you are so pathetic. Why can't your son just play with his doll?
Hey!!|I gotta go to work. Has anybody seen my left boob?
Hey!!|I love that movie.
Hey!!|There it is. Joey, what are you doing?
Hey!!|I'm sorry, it just felt nice.
Hey!!|Joe. Joe! Answer the phone.
Hey!!|Hey, I only got one good arm, you know. You should be doing stuff for me. Go get me a sweater.
Hey!!|Just do it! Okay, it's Janice and if I get it I'm going to have to see her tonight.  Oh, that's great I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
Hey!!|What's the big deal? Why don't you wanna see Janice?
Hey!!|Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes.
Hey!!|And that's bad because..., you hate chicken piccata?
Hey!!|Noo.
Hey!!|You didn't want to share your tomatoes, tomatoes are very important to you.
Hey!!|No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'
Hey!!|Men are unbelievable.
Hey!!|What is it with you people! I mean, the minute you start to feel something, you have to run away?
Hey!!|I know, that,  that's why I don't want to go tonight, I'm afraid I'm going to say something stupid.
Hey!!|Oh, you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you.
Hey!!|Hey, you know about that?!
Hey!!|Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!
Hey!!|Where there is no fear of commitment.
Hey!!|Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?
Hey!!|Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right. In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.
Hey!!|Amazingly, that makes sense.
Hey!!|You think?
Hey!!|Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!
Hey!!|Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?|Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?|Come on baby, come on!
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'|Very nice touch.
Op, went through a tunnel.|Unbelievable.
Op, went through a tunnel.|Thank you so much.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.|You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.|Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Two?|Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right|Nooo, four.
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?|'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Ohhh, are you a puppy!  Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.|Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.|Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.|Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
We should?|Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?|I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
You probably want us to move in together?|It doesn't scare me!
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...|Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!
Honey, this will help.|So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Honey, this will help.|Uff.
Honey, this will help.|That is never good.
Honey, this will help.|Then I got all needy and clingy.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?|She said she'd call me.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?|Ohh!
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?|Oh God.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?|Welcome to our side of the tunnel.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?|This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.|You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Yeah, you do.|So, you don't think I'm terminal?
Yeah, you do.|Well, no, not at all, you're not terminal, you just, you just need some damage control.
Yeah, you do.|Okay, okay. So, should I call her?
Yeah, you do.|Nooo!
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.|She has to know that your not ready.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.|So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.|I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.|G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.|G. I. Joe! Cool! Can I play?
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Go Joe!!!
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Pheebs! There you are!
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|No it's not, sorry.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe. Phoebe!
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Oh, Joey! Oh, okay, see I didn't recognize you wearing, in those....pants.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Look listen, that TV movie I went in for? Did you hear anything? I think I got a shot at it.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Yes! They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|It's okay, these things happen.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|I'm, I'm okay. See.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|They actually said that?
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this.  I canna work on a new accent.
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Yeah okay, no if it helps you okay. Yeah.
Chandler!|Hello, Janice.
What are you doing here?|Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Are you being British?!|No. Not anymore.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?|Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?|Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?|Here in Chelsea.
Who's party is it?|A woman's
What woman?!|Chelsea.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?|Can I be that guy?
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.|Okay, shoot.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.|I didn't get it?
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.|Okay, what else?
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'|Oh.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'|Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Oh.|Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Yeah, no, I understand.|You do, thanks.
Yeah. Sorry.|Wait a minute.
What?|Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.|That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.|My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?|Yeah, it is.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?|You know what, everything's gonna be okay.
Okay, what do I do?|Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Okay, what do I do?|If-if-if we ever did what you did a man would never call.
Okay, what do I do?|Yeah.
Hello!|Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
Hello!|Yes, and grumpy.
What are you, stop naming dwarves!  Really?!|He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
I love you too.|Aw, it's soo unfair.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|What'd you do, dip it in sugar?
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|Look, G. I. Joe's in, Barbi's out. And if you guys can't deal with it, that's your 'too bad.'
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|What are you being such a weenie for? So he has a Barbi, big deal. You used to dress up like a woman.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|What?
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|Well, you used to dress up in Mom's clothes all the time.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|What are you talking about?
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|The big hat, the pearls, the little pick handbag.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|Okay, you are totally making this up.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|How can you not remember? You made us call you...Bea.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|Oh God.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|I've literally never been this happy.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|Wasn't there a little song?
Oh please God, let there be a song.|There was no song.  There was no song!
Oh please God, let there be a song.|'I am Bea.'
Oh please God, let there be a song.|Okay.
Oh please God, let there be a song.|'I drink tea.'
Oh please God, let there be a song.|Okay, that's, that's enough.
Oh please God, let there be a song.|'....Won't you, won't you, won't you.... '
Oh please God, let there be a song.|Won't you dance around with me.
Oh please God, let there be a song.|A-ha!!!

Hey!|Hey!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?|No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.
Yeah!|Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
You’re building a post office?|No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max.
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.|Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.|Power saw kinda got away from me there.
Hey Pheebs.|Hey!
Any sign of your brother?|No, but he’s always late.
I thought you only met him once?|Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ‘Frank’s always late.’

Hi Daddy!|This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
You remember Ross.|Um-hmm.
You remember Ross.|Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
You remember Ross.|So!  How’s the library?
You remember Ross.|Ugh, museum.
You remember Ross.|What happened to the library?
You remember Ross.|There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
You remember Ross.|You know what’s really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
You remember Ross.|Yeah, if you’re really hungry.  It was a joke, I made a joke.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.|What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.|It’s not a library...
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.|
So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.|They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
It gives it a nice antiquey look.|Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.|Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.|Okay.
Okay!|Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.
Yeah.  Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.|Yeah. That’s Daddy.
That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.|Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.
So?|So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.
You really serve people sneezers?|Well um, I don’t.
You really serve people sneezers?|You kids ready?
Thanks again, Dr. Green.|All right.
Thanks again, Dr. Green.|Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
Oh, ah, you don’t need that.|Why not?
The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.|What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.|Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that.
I know.|Excuse me, you think I’m cheap?
I know.|Oh Daddy, no he didn’t mean anything by that, he really didn’t.
Nothing I do means anything, really.|This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.|Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.|Guess what, I got an audition!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.|I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
You bet! What’s the part?|Oh it’s great, it’s a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.|Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.|Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.|Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.|I’m, I’m freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn’t have! All right, I haven’t lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
Um. yeah.|I am soo dead.
All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.|Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.|Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’
Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?|Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!|Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.

Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.|Okay.  It’s a racecar.
Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.|So. This has always been Monica’s bed, what you’re just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.|Okay, well it this bed isn’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.|Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
No.|Whoa. That was really good.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!|Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.
You totally screwed him over.|Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?
You totally screwed him over.|Because, Monica, the guy’s so good, and I really, really want this part.

How did you know?|Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
In the park?|No! In his office! How many kisses were there?

Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.|Uh.
Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.|What?
Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.|Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.|Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.|I’m tellin’ ya, he hasn’t moved since this morning.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.|All right, we should call somebody.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.|And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn’t moving.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.|Well, we have gotta find out if he’s alive.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.|How are we gonna do that? There’s no way.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.|Well, there is one way. His window’s open, I say, we poke him.
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?|Yeah.
Well, now we got a reason.|What?
Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.|All right.
Hey uh, what’s a matter?|I talked to Janice.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?|She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?|I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.|Come on, tell me.
All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out.|What?  What are you, what are you talking about?
Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?|Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.|I did!
I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.|I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Monica?|Yeah.
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?|No. Why?
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.|Really?!
Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know...|Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know...|I hope it’s still funny when you’re in hell.
Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know...|
Monica bang! Monica bang!  Ow!|I’ll get the hat.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.|Okay.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.|Wow!
Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.|Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say ‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my soulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
Then don’t leave me!|What?
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!|No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give my marriage another chance.
No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.|
Ohhh. Don’t go.|No, I-I-I gotta go.
No. No! No! No!|Honey, honey, people are looking.
I don’t care!  I don’t care!!|Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now.
You can’t leave! I have your shoe!|Good-bye Chandler Bing.
You can’t leave! I have your shoe!|Rachel has those in burgendy.

All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.|I’m telling you he’s dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke.  Thread the needle. Thread the needle.|He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke.  Thread the needle. Thread the needle.|And yet, we’re still poking him.

Y'know, for once, I am going to sit down and try to watch one of these things. .|Oh! That would be sooo much fun!
Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.|Great, you can cover Chandler.
Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.|No, no, no, I don’t, I don’t really wanna play.
Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.|Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.
Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.|That’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don’t say that I don’t have goals!
Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.|Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it’ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don’t play, everyone will be mad at you ‘cause the teams won’t be even. Come on.
Oh, can I play too? I’ve never played football, like ever.|Yeah, all right, I’ll play.
Yay!!|Let’s do it! Ross?

Yay!!|To score the winning touchdown, by the way.
Yay!!|Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho, ho, ho, you did not win the game, the touchdown didn’t count, because of the spectacularly illegal, oh and by the way savage nose breaking.
Yay!!|I won the game.
Yay!!|Oh yeah! Then how come you didn’t get the Geller Cup?
Yay!!|Um, there was a Geller Cup?
Yay!!|Yes, it was the trophy you got if you won the game. But our Dad said, ‘nobody won that game, ‘ and he was sick of our fighting, so he took the trophy and....  threw it in the lake.
Yay!!|And was the curse lifted?
Yay!!|Anyway. That’s when our Mom said we were not to play football ever again.

It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.|You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.
It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.|Oh, what a great argument, exhaling! All right, y'know what, I’ll prove it to you, okay. I’ll trade you Joey for Rachel, and I’ll still win the game.

Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.|When they’re hungry enough, they’ll come in.
Let go!|No! You let go!
No!|How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?
I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.|Hey! It’s starting to snow.
I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.|Gimme the this!
Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.|What?

Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?|Yeah.
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?|Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?|Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?|Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.

So that’s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.|Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
So that’s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.|I was shrieking... like a Marine.

You broke a little girl’s leg?!!|I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
You broke a little girl’s leg?!!|Where exactly were around ten-ish?
You broke a little girl’s leg?!!|Well, I’m gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she’ll like?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|I’m gonna get back to retraining.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|All right, see you guys.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|Look out kids, he’s coming!
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|Have fun. Oh wait, no, don’t! I forgot I am totally against that now.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|What? Me having a job?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights.  Hey, how do you sleep at night?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|Well, I’m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|Really?
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it’s the only chance to see New York.
...and after you’ve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....|Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
What if you put them here.|Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
They already do. That’s why they call it the ‘tray spot.’|Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.|Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?|Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.|No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?|The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Yeah.|So far, I’ve sold seventy-five.
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able.  How much are the boxes?|Five dollars a box.
And what is second prize?|A ten speed bike. But, I’d rather have something my Dad couldn’t sell.
Well, that makes sense.|Could you do me one favor, if it’s not too much trouble?
Yeah, Sarah, anything.|Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across the alley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Yesss?|Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.
You’re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.|No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird
What does that mean?|Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!|No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
I’m pressing, a policeman is on his way.|Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going.
I can still see you!|All right!!
Hey.|Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah,  oh, but oh...|Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Destiny.|Sure.
Yes.|All right.
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.|Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.|Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
So, what happens to the old guys?|Well, they go into the chipper.
Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds?|
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.|All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?|Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Mon?|All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.  Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.|No.
Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.|Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.
I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.|
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|I’m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|Look Rach, wasn’t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|Well, yeah! I’m still pursuing that.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|Well, I’m also sending out.... good thoughts.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you’ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|The fear?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|He’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|Well then how come you’re still at a job that you hate, I mean why don’t you quit and get ‘the fear’?
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|Because, I’m too afraid.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|I don’t know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don’t want to be 30 and still work here.
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|Yeah, that’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
Rachel?|Yeah.
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.|Can’t I just look at the handles on them?
You would think.|Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.
What?!|Gunther, I quit.
What?!|
....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?|I spelled out boobies.

Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.|
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.|So, how many have you sold so far?
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!|Oh my God, how did you do that?
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'|Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?|Me! On my computer.
Well you sure used a large font.|Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Well you sure used a large font.|Hey-hey-hey that’s funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
Well you sure used a large font.|Something else I might have said?
Well you sure used a large font.|I don’t know, I don’t know, weren’t you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.|No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.
Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.|You-you-you don’t wanna give into the fear.
Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.|You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....

Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.|
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.|It’s-it’s-it’s almost dead!
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.|Okay but that’s why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it’s Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.|I-I think I’m gonna look around a little bit more.

I can’t tell you that, no.|He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
I can’t tell you that, no.|Why don’t you go up there and ask him to ‘step lightly, please?’
I can’t tell you that, no.|I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.

Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?|Honey, what’s the matter?
I just saw Janice.|Oh.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.|Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.|Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.|Hey Chandler, there’s a party tomorrow, you’ll feel better then.
Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.|It’s Joey’s birthday.

Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.|I know honey, I’m sorry.

Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?|I’m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....

Yes?!|I ah, I work at Bloomingdale’s and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
Hey guys.|Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
Hey guys.|Well, he’s very charming.
Hey guys.|I know, he’s too charming, but if you two start going out, then it’s just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
Hey guys.|Well, you’re just gonna have to try.
Hey guys.|Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
Hey guys.|I don’t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin’ ‘em around...
Hey guys.|Chandler!
Hey guys.|Hello-dillillio!!
Hey guys.|Oh, somebody’s feeling better.
Hey guys.|Stick out your tongue.
Hey guys.|Take off your shirt!
Hey guys.|Oh my!!
Hey guys.|Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
Hey guys.|Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
Hey guys.|The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
Hey guys.|Hi!
Hey guys.|Hi! So I’m out having lunch at Monica’s and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale’s and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he’s gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
Hey guys.|Wow!
Hey guys.|I know!
Hey guys.|What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
Hey guys.|Uh-huh!
Hey guys.|And he’s, he’s a total stranger?
Hey guys.|Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
Hey guys.|Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
Hey guys.|What!?
Hey guys.|Well, I’m just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
Hey guys.|To be nice.
Hey guys.|Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
Hey guys.|No, only for sex.
Hey guys.|Thank you.  So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
Hey guys.|I didn’t have to, because I was wearing my ‘I heart Ross’ sandwich board and ringing my bell.
Hey guys.|Uh-huh.
Hey guys.|
Hey guys.|Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
Hey guys.|Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
Hey guys.|How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey’s sisters.
Hey guys.|Hi Joey’s sisters!
Hey guys.|Hey!
Hey guys.|Hey. What are we drinkin’ over here.
Hey guys.|Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
Hey guys.|No kiddin,’ that’s the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
Hey guys.|Wow. Okay, I don’t know how to talk to you.
Hey guys.|What ‘cha doing?
Hey guys.|Oh, I’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
Hey guys.|Oh!!
Hey guys.|No-no-no-no, no, it’s a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can’t we savor the precious moments?  Those are some huge breasts you have.
Hey guys.|Hi.
Hey guys.|Hi.
Hey guys.|Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
Hey guys.|Isn’t that great?
Hey guys.|Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
Hey guys.|Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, ‘Hummina-hummina-hummina.’
Hey guys.|That’s excellent.
So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?|Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.
So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?|How ya feelin’?
So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?|Well, my apartment isn’t there anymore, because I drank it.
So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?|Where’d you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
Yeah.|Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Yeah.|Woooo hoooo!!!
Yeah.|Ow, no ‘woo-hooing,’ no ‘woo-hooing.’
Yeah.|Why, what happened?
Yeah.|Ah, I fooled around with Joey’s sister.  Well, that’s not the worst part.
Yeah.|What is the worse part?
Yeah.|I can’t remember which sister.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.|Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.|How can you not know which one?
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.|I mean that’s unbelievable.
I mean, was it Gina?|Which one is Gina?
I mean, was it Gina?|Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
No, no, no, that’s Dina.|You see you can’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!
No, no, no, that’s Dina.|We didn’t fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
No, no, no, that’s Dina.|Veronica. Look, it’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
That was me.|Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.
That’s okay.|That’s all right.
That’s okay.|That’s okay.
That’s okay.|Can I talk to you for a second?!
That’s okay.|Hey, Joey.
That’s okay.|Hey.
That’s okay.|Come on!!
That’s okay.|Why can’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
That’s okay.|I just got off the phone with my sister.
That’s okay.|Ah, which, which one?
That’s okay.|Mary-Angela.
That’s okay.|Mary-Angela.
That’s okay.|Yeah.
Y'know which one was she again?|Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.
Y'know which one was she again?|It’s gotta be the first one.
Y'know which one was she again?|Really? That’s great! You and my sister, sittin’ in a tree.
Y'know which one was she again?|Yep, I’m in a tree.

Music. Very nice.|Oh my God!
So, how are you?|I am good. I finished my book.
Oh yeah, what’s it about?|I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write.  What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?|Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.
All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.|What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?|Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
I’m here to see Mary-Angela.|You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Where’s Mary-Angela?|She’s right in there.
Where’s Mary-Angela?|Hey, Chandler!
I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.|Bummer.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.|No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.|Wait a minute, why don’t you just call Mark.  I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you’ve got to make stuff happen.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.|But, you, you don’t want to seem too pushy.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.|Honey, it’s not pushy, he gave her his home number.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.|What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.|That’s right good things, that-that is what I said.
He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.|That is so made up!
I got the interview!|Yay!
I got the interview!|There you go.
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.|Oh, that is amazing!
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.|Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I’d expect nothing less.

Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later.  Woo hoo!|What?! Ross y'know this isn’t even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you’re right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later.  Woo hoo!|No.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later.  Woo hoo!|I mean don’t you trust her?
Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later.  Woo hoo!|Well, yeah!

So will I.|Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.|Just do it.
Hey!|Finally, I thought we’d never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.  Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.|So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.|No, I’m Mary-Theresa.

Oh, this is soo bad.|Joey!!!
No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!|What’s goin’ on?
You’re it! Now run and hide!|It’s no big deal. Chandler was just kissin’ me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
You’re it! Now run and hide!|What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was.  Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.|I say, punch him Joey.
I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was.  Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.|Yeah! Punch him!!
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me.  Are ya?|Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.|So what. I say, punch him.
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.|Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!

Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.|I’ll do it.
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.|No you won’t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he’s sorry. But,  you’ve got one more apology to make, all right, you’ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
Okay, absolutely!|All right.
You’ve got it.|Cookie, now you can punch him!
Hey!|Hi!
What are you doing here?|Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
Oh.|Hi.

Yeah, I do know.|Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
Yeah, I do know.|Oh, I’m sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
Yeah, I do know.|Maybe he’s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
Yeah, I do know.|Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
Yeah, I do know.|All right, that’s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe.  But, is he a big guy?
Yeah, I do know.|Ah, we’ll all go.
Yeah, I do know.|Thanks you guys! Thank you.
Yeah, I do know.|Don’t worry.

Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.|Eric Aasen
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?|Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Tell him.|It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Tell him.|All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
Tell him.|Why?
Tell him.|I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.

Tell him.|Hmm? Oh, yeah.
Tell him.|Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
Tell him.|It must take you forever to find your keys.

Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.|Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing.  Is this actually a lunchbox?|Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Oh.|Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
Oh.|What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
Oh.|Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.

Well not exactly like the one in the poem.|What do you mean?
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?|What?
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.|Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't even know me...|Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
What?|The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...|No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
No, no, no. What was that?|I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Well, people!|People, people, people.

Right.|Hi.
Hello.|Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
Hello.|I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
A big idiot.|A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?|Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?|Let it be me! Let it be me!
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.|I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.|Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
Where ya going?|Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Ohh, with who?|Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
There was a woman at the...  The stripper?!|Yeah.
You have a play date with a stripper?!|Man, I gotta get a kid.
You have a play date with a stripper?!|Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
Sure, is she married?|Ahh, no.
Oh.|Are you jealous?
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?|You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...|Honey, I love you too.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.|What?
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.|Huh.
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.|Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Is there a Julio here?|I am Julio.

You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn.|He’s gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy.  This is nice.

Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Hi.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Hey.

Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Oh! Since tomorrow. I met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know, jogs, and blades, and swims, and so y'know we made a deal that’s he’s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|And what are you going to do for him?
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|I’m going to let him.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Okay.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Cool.

Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Yeah well, I ran into Richard.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|When did this happen?
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Oh, um, around 8:02. We ah, talked for a little while, and then um, we went out for an innocent burger.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Oh, there’s no such thing as an innocent burger.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|So, are you gonna see him again?
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Tomorrow night.
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|Monica, what are you doing?
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.|It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.|Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you’ll probably be hungry after the sex.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.|We’re not gonna have sex! Okay, nothing’s changed here. He still doesn’t want children and I still do, so that’s why we’re just gonna be friends.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.|Naked friends.
Hey.|Hey.
Do you have any ice?|Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?|I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Hmm.  Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?|Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?|Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
How often do you read it?|Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?|The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.
Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining,  and you will read Little Women.|All right, you got it.
All right.|Okay.
Okay.|Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Yeah.|How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.|Oh, hey.
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.|Hi.
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.|Hey.

I’ll have coffee.|Yeah, me too.
I’ll have coffee.|Yeah, make that three.
I’ll have coffee.|Okay Ross, why don’t you come with me?
I’ll have coffee.|Okay.  What ah, what is the matter with you? What’s going on?

I’ll have coffee.|No. He.....he’s coming out of his shorts.
I’ll have coffee.|What?!
I’ll have coffee.|The man is showing brain.
I’ll have coffee.|Are you sure?  I’m sorry you guys, that was a coffee and a....
I’ll have coffee.|Coffee.
I’ll have coffee.|Okay.
I’ll have coffee.|We could write it down for you?
I’ll have coffee.|No, no, that won’t be ah, that won’t be necessary
I’ll have coffee.|Wellll?
I’ll have coffee.|Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I’ll have coffee.|What do we do? What do we do?
I’ll have coffee.|Well, I suppose we just try to not look directly at it.
I’ll have coffee.|Like an eclipse.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?|You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Ew, this feels very weird.|You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them.  That’s my hand.|Oops.
Okay.|Gotta keep squishing.
Tomatoes are squishing.|Okay.
Op.|Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Yeah.|Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it  and it should umm, be.....
What?|Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.
These little women. Wow!|Your liking it, huh?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.|Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.
But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie.  Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.|No, actually Laurie’s a boy.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|Hey!
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|Hey.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|Hey! How’d the ah, basketball go?
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|Oh, okay, I learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a twenty-three pointer.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|You mean a three pointer?
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|Oh, I get more because I’m dainty.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|So um, is there a phone here, I can check my messages?
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|Yeah, in the back. You want a quarter?
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|Oh, no thanks. I always carry one in my sock.
Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.|Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.|What?  Why are you laughing?!
Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.|Calm down. There’s no reason to get testy.
Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.|You guys!! Come on!
Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.|I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isn’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped.
Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.|What do you mean?
Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.|Hey.
Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.|Hey.
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?|Sure.
Yeah, I do think it’s better this way.|You really sure?
So we can be friends who sleep together.|Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?|Just your dad.  Although that’s actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister’s neighbour next Tuesday.
Oh.|You want me to cancel it?
No!  No!|Okay.
‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.|Exactly.
Hey.|Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!
You ready to go to the batting cage?|Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.
Oh! Wow! Hey!|Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don’t think I can wear these, they’re so tight, I feel like I’m on display. I’m sorry.|That’s all right, that’s well, I figured....
Hey!|Hey!  How’s it going?
Hey!|Good.
Hey!|Hey, Rach, how you doing with The Shining?
Hey!|Oh, Danny just went into room 217.
Hey!|Oooh, the next part’s the best, when that dead lady in the bathtub...
Hey!|Oh, no, meh-nah-nah-nah, come on you’re gonna ruin it!
Hey!|All right I’ll talk in code.  Remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?
Hey!|Hmmm, that’s very cool.
Hey!|Oh, all blank, and no blank, make’s blank a blank blank. Oh no-no-no, no, the end when Jack almost kills them all with that blank, but then at last second they get away. Aww!
Hey!|Joey! I can’t believe you just did that!
Hey!|I can’t believe she cracked your code!
Hey!|All right, okay, Laurie proposes to Jo, and she says no, even though she’s still in love with him, and then he ends up marring Amy.
Hey!|Hey! Mine was by accident! All right, the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel, and kills the dad.
Hey!|Eh. Beth dies.
Hey!|Beth, Beth dies?
Hey!|Um-hmm.
Hey!|Is that true? If I keep reading is Beth gonna die?
Hey!|No, Beth doesn’t die, she doesn’t die. Does she Rachel?
Hey!|What?!
Hey!|Joey’s asking if you’ve just ruined the first book he’s ever loved that didn’t star Jack Nicholson?
Hey!|No. She doesn’t die.
Hey!|Then why would you say that?!
Hey!|Because, I wanted to hurt you.
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.|Oh my....
Hi.|Sorry. I’m sorry.
What are you smiling at?|I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.
Yeah, right.|Hello.
Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?|Oh.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’|We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’|He’s right, even if it’s to say something complementary.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’|Hey!
Hey.|So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
No, I can spot you from here.|What?
Okay, listen Robert...|Hey, don’t we have to...
Okay, listen Robert...|Yeah, we got, um-hmm.
Umm, I think you’re really, really great...|Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me?  Is it something I’m putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.|Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
Ow!|Really?! Well, it’s just like everyone else’s apartment. It’s got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Ow!|Well, I just wanted to see where you lived. Now, give me the tour.
Oh my God! Oh my God!|Ah well, this is the living room.
Oh my God! Oh my God!|Impressive.
Oh my God! Oh my God!|All right. This is the kitchen.
Oh my God! Oh my God!|Oh, that’s real pretty. Wait a minute, don’t I get to see the bedroom?
Oh my God! Oh my God!|The bedroom. Well it’s pretty much your typical...  bedroom.
Oh my God! Oh my God!|We’re still on this side of the door.
Oh my God! Oh my God!|Um-hmm.
Oh my God! Oh my God!|Yeah, but I didn’t get to see it.
Oh my God! Oh my God!|Oh shoot! Maybe next time.
So um, who was she?|Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.|Well, you seem fine.
Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?|You mean like exclusive friends?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.|Wow. Y'know we’re back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing’s changed.
That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.|Okay, okay, one thing’s changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.|I know I couldn’t. So....
Watch the thorns!|Ow!!
What?|Beth is really, really sick.
Awwww.|Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.
Joey?|Yeah.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?|Okay.
‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....|Wow! This girl is good.
‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....|Oh-ho yeah! A song with rhyming words. Oo, I never thought of that before.
‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....|I like her.
‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....|Why? Because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time?
‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....|Well, that’s pretty much all I’m looking for from these people.
‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....|Look at you. All jealous.
‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....|Yeah Pheebs, come on, you two have completely different styles. Y'know, she’s more..
.|Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done.
Okay, my next song’s called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn’t Have Left You That Way.|Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.
Hey Phoebe.|Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?
Hey Phoebe.|I ran into Vlad at the place where they sell the big fish, and he said you played here a lot, so umm....
Hey Phoebe.|All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I’d like know whether that’s several big fish or just one big fish.
Hey Phoebe.|So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.
Hey Phoebe.|Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.
Hey Phoebe.|Ah, anything we might of heard of?
Hey Phoebe.|Ah, yeah, umm.  Home is never far away..
Hey Phoebe.|Home is Home Star stew.
Hey Phoebe.|Yeah, but, I don’t do that anymore. I got kinda sick of it, and then I couldn’t come up with anything good, so they fired me.
Hey Phoebe.|Hmm, bummer.
Hey Phoebe.|Well, I y'know, I was just, umm, I was just thinking and hoping, that umm, maybe you’d want to get back together?
Hey Phoebe.|No. But thanks.
Hey Phoebe.|Aw come on Phoebe would you just think about it?
Hey Phoebe.|Okay. No. But thanks.
Hey Phoebe.|Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs.
Hey Phoebe.|Wow, that was kinda brutal.
Hey Phoebe.|Well okay, let this be a lesson to all of you, all right. Once you, once you betray me, I become like the ice woman, y’know. Very cold, hard, unyielding, y'know nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior.  Can I have a tissue, please?
Hey Phoebe.|Yeah, sure.
Someone in there?|No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’
Someone in there?|Jeez, man did you fall.. Hi! So ah, did ya, did-did-did ya fall high?
Someone in there?|Someone was in the lady's room, I couldn’t wait. I left the lid up for ya though.
Someone in there?|This is the part where you say your name.
Someone in there?|Ginger.
Someone in there?|Ginger. I’m talking to Ginger, so....
Someone in there?|Don’t you have to use the bathroom?
Someone in there?|Nope, nope, I’d just ah, I’d rather talk to you.
Where’s Chandler?|Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his...
Where’s Chandler?|Joey? Joey Tribbiani?
Where’s Chandler?|Joey I can see you okay? You’re hiding behind the coats.
Where’s Chandler?|Phew, close one.
Hi.|Hi, sweetie!
Hello.|Hi, Ross.
Yeah, huh.|I’ve got some bad news.
What?|I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?|Actually, it’s kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
Oh hey, but that’s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?|Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job.
Oh well that’s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye.|Okay, then.
Okay.|Well we’re gonna miss you around here.
Okay.|Yeah, me too.
Okay.|So, see ya on Saturday.
Okay.|Yeah, you bet.
Oh.|Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!|Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.|Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
You never run on a barge!|Hey.
You never run on a barge!|Hey.
You never run on a barge!|Is ah, is Chandler around?
You never run on a barge!|No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.
You never run on a barge!|Oooh.
You never run on a barge!|Yeah, Ginger something.
You never run on a barge!|Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn’t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?
You never run on a barge!|No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,  ‘the movie star.’
You never run on a barge!|Aww, man. That’s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he’s my roommate, she’s gonna tell him what I did.
You never run on a barge!|Well, what did you do?
You never run on a barge!|What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can’t, I can’t tell you that, it’s like the most awful, horrible thing I’ve ever done my whole life.
You never run on a barge!|Y'know what, don’t tell us. We’ll just wait until Chandler gets home,  because it’ll be more fun that way.
You never run on a barge!|All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad’s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....
You never run on a barge!|You gave her food poisoning!?
You never run on a barge!|I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!|I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!|Oh my God! Joey, what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!|I ran!!
Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.|Actually, me too.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.|Oh damn, I hate that.
Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.|Oh, don’t worry about it.
No, really you’re gonna freeze.|No, I’m not.
You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?|Some day, maybe.
Funny book?|Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn’t mind.|Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.|Oh, well...
Oh my God!!! Ross!!|Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Because, he’s my friend.|Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?|Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.|Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Really!?|Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?|What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.|It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.|You think you know me so well.
Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?|Yeah.
Okay, well I do know you.|That’s what I said.
Well so?|I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don’t care what people say. My feet’s best friends, pals to the end. With them I’m one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....|I stepped in something icky.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don’t care what people say. My feet’s best friends, pals to the end. With them I’m one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....|Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, always make me smile. Sticky shoes, sticky shoes, next time I’ll.... avoid the..... pillleeeee.
We’re beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....|You’re so pretty. I love you.
We’re beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....|Oh.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it’s not your fault.|Wow, that’s great.
Oh, yeah!|Y'know you could totally sell this. It’d be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.|What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.|Aw, you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.
Hi!|Hey.
Oh, can I borrow this?  My milk’s gone bad.|Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?|Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness.
Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.|Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Uh-huh.|Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.
Uh-huh.|Morning.
Uh-huh.|Actually he’s the smallest person in the world.
Uh-huh.|Heard about the leg burnin’ huh?
Uh-huh.|It came up.
Uh-huh.|Listen, I ah, I know it’s a longshot. But, by any chance did she find that funny?
So I nodded off a little.|Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.|Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’
First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.|Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.|Oh, that is so...
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.|Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.|It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean?  I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.
That’s a little clearer.|Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Your thinking about my leg aren’t you?|No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
It’s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: ‘How much it bothers you?’ because I don’t like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?|No. No. I don’t think so.
What’s that?|That’s-that’s my nubbin.
What’s a nubbin?|It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.

No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway.

And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.|No, no, I don’t want to forget it.

Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute.|Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?

What time is it now?|4:30.
Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.|Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Yes. Vividly.|She was kidding about that right?
Yeah, I-I-I think so.  Yeah, I-I think so...|God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?|Dude, I don’t know.
She was kidding.|Yeah.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.|Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....|Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...  be?
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.|Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?
We’re holding.|Hi!
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?|Well you said you couldn’t go out so....
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?|You brought a picnic, oh, what a boyfriend. That’s it, on Monday I start wearing make-up.
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.|Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.|Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here.
But I don’t, hmm...  Get me Mark on the phone!|I love Mark.  Do you know Mark?
But I don’t, hmm...  Get me Mark on the phone!|Yeah!!
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for|Pepper?
None for me.|Okay sorry, whew.
I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m sorry but that’s...  Oh my God!!|Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
What are you doing?|I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.|Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?
I don’t have ten minutes!!|What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!|Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I’ll talk to you later.|Yeah, but wait...
Good bye!|Actually, that’s our three hole punch.
Hey.|Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.|I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?|You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.|But I told you, I didn’t have the time!
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.|Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!|Just a job!
Yes.|Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.|Well neither do I!
Is this about Mark?|Oh my God.
Okay, it’s not, it’s not.|Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.
Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.|I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break,|No.  A break from us.
Hi, Ross.|Oh, hi Chloe.
I want you to met some friends of mine.  This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don’t do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say ‘let’s Ross it!’|And that’s the only colour that comes in.
I want you to met some friends of mine.  This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don’t do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say ‘let’s Ross it!’|Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
Oh!|So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Oh!|Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we’re gonna break-up instead.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?|Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.|Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.|You didn’t say Boutros Boutros Gali.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.|Boutros Boutros Gali.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.|He says he was too.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.|Interesting.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.|So I was wondering....
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.|Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.|So you're a chef?
I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.|Oh, really.
I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.|Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please.  What are you doing?
Well, I was having a conversation.|Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?|That would be great. Thank you.
Hello!|Oh, hi. It’s Mark.
Oh.|What? Is it my breath?
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!|Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn’t tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Yeah. Well, umm.....|Rach, are you okay?
Yeah, I’m fine.|You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.|All right, all right, I’m coming over, and I’m bringing Chinese food.
Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.|It’s for me.
So what are you gonna do?|What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
So what are you gonna do?|Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
So what are you gonna do?|Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don’t I have to wait a while?
So what are you gonna do?|Hey, this isn’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
So what are you gonna do?|Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.|Why? What happened to him?
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.|Wow. I’m sorry. Eggroll?
No.  And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.|Well, then he’s, he’s probably just, out.
Hello.|Hi! It’s me.
Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.|Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?
Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.|Hey, what do you want to drink?
Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.|Who’s that?
Nobody.|Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Nobody.|Is that Mark?
Yeah! Got it!|Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Ah, that’s okay, thanks.|Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.
Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?|Oh, okay.
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.|Oh.  Can I have a tissue?
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.|Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don’t accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.|Well, tell him, apology accepted.
You silly diplomat, why don’t you learn some English, Sergei?|Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?
You silly diplomat, why don’t you learn some English, Sergei?|Hey, the man’s dog just died.
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.|It will be my pleasure.
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.|Uh,  plate?

I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.|Plate?
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.|Yeah.

Oh, no, no.|What? Are you married? ‘Cause that’s okay.
Ameri-ccan.|Ameri-can.
Ameri-ccan.|Ameri-can. Y'know it’s a very hard language. Let’s do it again.
|Previously on Friends.
I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.|You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?
Is this about Mark?|Oh my God.
Okay, it’s not, it’s not.|Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break,|No. A break from us.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.|I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.|Hey, what do you want to drink?
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.|Who’s that?
Nobody.|Is that Mark?
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....|Yeah! Got it!
Hey.|Hey.
How’s the big anniversary dinner?|Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Ohhh, nice.|No, we kinda broke up instead.
What?!|God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.
That’s okay, this is more important than fruit  on my ceiling! You broke up?!|Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Oh no!!|No.
Rachel, you and Mark?!|No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.|Yeah!!
Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.|Na-huh.
So, I love you.|I love you.
And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30.|Okay.
Bye.|Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!
Bye.|Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
Bye.|Umm, oh, hey, I don’t know. How about a big one?
Bye.|But my apartment is so...
Bye.|Well then a small one!! Listen, let’s, we kinda have to get going!
Bye.|Wait! Where’s my shoes?
Bye.|You, you sure you need shoes?
Bye.|Do I know why we’re rushing?
Bye.|Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
Bye.|That’s so great for you guys!
Bye.|Yeah!
Bye.|You must be so happy!
Bye.|Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I’m feeling. Well....
Bye.|Good luck, with your girlfriend.
Bye.|Oh, thank you.  Rachel!!!!
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.|Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?|Yes, you can, very much.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?|
Hey!|Hey.
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?|Oh, there’s banana on it.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.|So then you know?
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.|Oh, good. Thanks.
Now what is Fabutec?|Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Waxine!!|Yes! Have you seen it?
Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.|I know!!
God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?|Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Oh my God! Oh my God!|Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Oh my God! Oh my God!|You think?! God, I, ah, I’m in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel’s all like, ‘I love you and, and let’s work on this.’ And all I can think about is, ‘What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?’ when I tell her what I did.
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?|What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?|Look, Ross look, I’m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that’s gonna get you in trouble.
He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.|Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.
He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.|Yeah, but don’t you think....
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.|Yeah, okay.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.|All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn’t find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.|What trail?
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.|You always have to think about the trail!
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.|Oh, I-I don’t think there’s any trail.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,|Did that!
Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.|Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was it not pain-free?|No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.|That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!|Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?
Chloe? Hi..|Is this about me taking your watch?
You took my watch?|I’m sorry, I do that.
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?|Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know.
Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?|Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...|You dog!
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.|Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.|Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?|Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me.
Actually, no, we’re not.|Yeah, we are.
No, we’re not.|Yeah, we are.
No, we’re not!!|Okay, we’re not.
Right.|But, we are.
Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.|I can promise not to tell her again.
Jasmine?|Uh-huh.
We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.|You did a bad thing!
Yes, I did.|Very bad!
Very bad.|Very, very bad.
I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?|No.
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?|All right.
Thank you, thank you.|But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.|I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?
Ow!|Oh!!
Ow!! Ow!!|Ow!!!
Ow!! Ow!!|Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Ow!! Ow!!|We’re all right.
It’s okay, it’s okay.|We’re all right.
We were just waxing our legs.|Off?!!
We were just waxing our legs.|For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
We were just waxing our legs.|Yeah, well I don’t think you can make that statement, unless you’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
We were just waxing our legs.|Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that’s all. I mean, come on, it’s just a little wax.
We were just waxing our legs.|Oh yeah, come here.
We were just waxing our legs.|Oh, that’s mature.
We were just waxing our legs.|Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
We were just waxing our legs.|Uh-huh.
I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!|What?
I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!|Nothing, nothing.
I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!|Rachel said everything was okay.
I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!|What, what are they talking about?
I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!|Rachel?
Just get away from me!|No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Oh my God.|Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Oh my God.|Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!|He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!|No!!
Just get out! Now!!|No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
What?|Was she good?
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?|She was...
Awful! Horrible!|She was not good. Not good.
Ewwwww!|Uh-oh.
Good different?|Nobody likes change.
Good different?|What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Should we do something?|Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.|Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!|And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.|We were on a break!
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.|You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!|Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore.|What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.
Why not?!  I’m hungry.|Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!|Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.|Yeah, we’ll be fine.
Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?|All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Yes I would.|You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Yes.|You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?|I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.|We could eat the wax! It’s organic.
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.|Oh great, food with hair on it.
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.|No, not the used wax.
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.|Because that would be crazy?
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.|Fine.  Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.
No anchovies.|With ah, extra anchovies.
That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.|Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
You can have the last piece, if you want.|Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?|Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.
They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?|What if they don’t?
They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?|You think I need a new walk?
They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?|What?
They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?|Well y'know, I’ve been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a ‘take notice’ walk.
They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?|Are you actually saying these words?
Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah, okay.|Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah, okay.|Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!|That’s....
That’s what?!|That is neither here nor there.
Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?  I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.|No Ross!!  Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?
Okay, okay, okay.|I think you should go.
What?|I really think you need to go now.
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...|Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  and, and....|it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.
Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.|Then how come it is?
They’ve been quiet for a long time.|Maybe she killed him?
They’ve been quiet for a long time.|Let’s go.
Is that your new walk?|No, I really have to pee.
Can I see the comics?|This is the New York Times.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?|We are. He’s meeting us here.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Why? What happened now?
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Well Ross was hangin’ out over at our place, Rachel comes over to borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He’s the one who slept with someone else.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened, that she should of forgiven him by now.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you’re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|I had the same dream!
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Oh, I had the opposite dream.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Y'know what maybe it’s gonna be okay, I mean it’s been a week.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Yeah, I mean it’s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.
Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!|Hey!
Let’s get the show on it!|Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.|Closer than here?
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.|Okay, let’s skedaddle.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.|Wait, I’m not just gonna drink somebody’s old coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.|Okay, your highness.

Oh.  Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!|Hey!

Hm-mm.|Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Ohh!|We’re sorry honey.
Oh, it’s okay.|Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really.  Are we talking models in their underwear?
And heels.|Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.|Oh yeah.

Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?|Yeahhh. I’m tellin’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time....
Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.|Him? Him, Ross?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.|Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.|Absolutely, yeah!
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.|Chandler! You’re smoking? What are you doing?!

It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean,  it’ll be grrreat.|We’re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.
It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean,  it’ll be grrreat.|Yeah, that’s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for the first weekend I’m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.
It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean,  it’ll be grrreat.|Y'know what, I can stay, I’m gonna stay. ‘Cause the last time I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.

Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?|Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?|Well he’s probably mad after you called him this morning to borrow his goggles.
Chandler!!|What?

Damn!  The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!|Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|What?!

Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|Please!!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|No, not getting my bra!
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|Okay, Monica’s are the biggest.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it’s gotta be Rachel.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually sometimes, st-stuff my bra.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|All right then, your bra would still be big.
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|No, I stuff outside the bra.
Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.|All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.|Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.|Okay, there.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.|Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.|Okay, now let’s decide who has the nicest ass.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.|And there you go!
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.|Oh, yeahhhhh!!!
Chandler!!|At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Okay.  Oh, no!|What, what’s it, what’s going on?
Yeah, this has happened before.|So you know how to fix it?
Hi!|Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here?|Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Ah yeah, but now it’s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.|Where’s Ben?
He’s sleeping.|Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan’s gonna be home any minute, it’s kinda an anniversary.|Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
It’s not that kind of anniversary.|Ah!  Oh.
Sooo!! Anyway...|Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.|Yeah, well.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?|Oh yeah, I’d love that.
Oh, great! Me too.|I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.|Great!
Yeah, what town are we near?|Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?|Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Okay.  Okay, either 93 or 76?|I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Okay.  Yeah, no they don’t do that.|Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
Okay.  Yeah, no they don’t do that.|Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.
Okay.  Yeah, no they don’t do that.|No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live here!
But if...|No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.
So the going for help went well?|Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
So the going for help went well?|I have the lung capacity of a two year old.
Then why are you smoking?|Well it’s very unsettling.
....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.|Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?|No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something.
Ross, thank God.|Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
|Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.
|Oh, now you want a favour?
|Yes, please.
|Well, oh, I’m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I’m a little too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got home safely okay?
|Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.
|No, I’m not gonna pick them up.
|Listen, we both know you’re gonna do it ‘cause you’re not a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or save us both time and sulk in the car.
|No, Rachel doesn’t want me to....
|Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you ‘cause she fell in love with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don’t punish your friends for what Rachel did to you.
|Yeah, you’re right.
|You slept with someone else?!
|We were on a break!!! Okay!!
|You slept with another woman?
|Oh, you-you’re-you’re one to talk.
Okay, done.|What’s ‘pleh’?
That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!|Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?
Ugh!!!|Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!
Ugh!!!|Hey!!
Ugh!!!|Hi!
What is he doing here?!|He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
What is he doing here?!|No! Come on!
Arrrghh!!|Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!
Arrrghh!!|You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we’re then gonna go skiing?
Arrrghh!!|Oh, this is horrible, it’s just horrible.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|Ask me what?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|No, I wasn’t gonna ask you that, no.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|Excuse me?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|It’s horrible.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|Oh please, can’t I come to your special, magical cabin?
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|Why would you even want to come Ross? You’re a horrible skier.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|Here we go again.
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|All right Pheebs, your cab’s ready.
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|All right, let’s go!
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|You’re welcome.
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|Oh, I’m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone else?
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|We were on a break!
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|Y'know Ross why don’t you put that on your answering machine!
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|Hey-hey, it’s valid okay? And I’m not the only one who thinks so, Monica agrees with me.
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|What?!
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|I don’t know.
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|That’s what you said last night.
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|What I said was, was that I understood. Joey’s the one who agreed with you!
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|Okay.
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|Really Joey?
What?|Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
What?|No, I think it’s very obvious who’s wrong here.
What?|Obviously not to Joey.
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.|Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!  You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.|Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want?  Can you be civil?|Yeah.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want?  Can you be civil?|I can.
Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.|Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?
Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.|Look, you guys, you guys should go.  No, I’m, you, you planned this all out, and I don’t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.
Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.|Come on man, you drove all the way up here.
Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.|No, no, really, I’ve got to take the car back anyway, I’m spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It’s fine, no guilt I promise.
Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.|Thank you.
Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.|All right, we’ll call you when we get back.
Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.|Okay.
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.|Okay.
Or, or the rodeo!!|That would be great.
Okay!|I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Okay!|I know!
Ross!|Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?
Ahh, nooo!!|Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.
You’re a genius, Ross.|Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Okay, I’ll pay you tomorrow.|Okay.
Okay, bye!!|So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Yeah, okay, bye.|So I’m gonna take off then!
What’s so funny?|Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh.
Oh.|What-what’s so funny?
Oh.|Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there’s none of that in here.
Oh.|Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
Oh.|Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
Oh.|Okay.
Oh.|Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
Oh.|No-no, why don’t you hang on to that one.
Oh.|Okay, that’s like the least fun game ever.
Oh.|Well, I’m really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
Oh.|Oh.
Oh.|Come on, it’s a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn’t smoked since.
Oh.|Pffhah.
Oh.|What’s your problem?
Oh.|Nothing, it’s just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
Oh.|Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
Oh.|Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
Oh.|Oh right, ‘cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
Oh.|All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
Oh.|Or what my Father called Thursday night.

Sorry.|What happened?
Sorry.|Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
Sorry.|But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?

Sorry.|Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck.  I’m gonna, I’m gonna get my ah, my fianc�e man!
Sorry.|Y'know, I would’ve bet good money that he’d be the first one of us to get married.
Sorry.|Yeah, isn’t it fantastic?
Sorry.|Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don’t you think he’s a little young to get married?
Sorry.|What, he’s 18.
Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|Always illegal Joe.
Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|
Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|Y'know it-it’s funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|Yeah, I’m a big surprise.
Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight’s ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.

Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|Ohhh.
Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|If that doesn’t keep kids in school, what will?
And so now you guys are gonna be married?|Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
And so now you guys are gonna be married?|Oh my God!! Great!
And so now you guys are gonna be married?|Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you’re ready for that?
And so now you guys are gonna be married?|I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn’t want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, ‘cause y'know, it’ll be me. Right?
And so now you guys are gonna be married?|Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there’s an age difference between us.
And so now you guys are gonna be married?|Oh good! Okay. ‘Cause you were acting like you didn’t.
And so now you guys are gonna be married?|Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.|Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Pete, can I get you something else?|Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out.
Haven’t you and I covered that topic?|Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you….
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.|Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.  Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.|Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain’t a pretty picture in the morning, y’know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
I mean really, think about it.|Ho-ho, I will.
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life,  y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!|Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!|Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank,  and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.|Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Yes. Not out loud.|Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t.  But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.|No-no-no-no-no.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!|No.
Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank.|So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.|Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?|Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids….  All right, I get your point.

All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.|Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88.
All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.|What, you don’t think I know that?
All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.|Look, the point is, there’s a lot of women out there you haven’t even had sex with yet!
Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.|Okay, but isn’t sex better when it’s with one person that you really, really care about.
Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.|Yeah, in a poem maybe.
No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.|You don’t have it anymore?
No, I ah, I slept with someone else.|Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
It didn’t.|Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I’ve got with Alice.
It didn’t.|Now, wh-what, what is that like?
It didn’t.|It’s so cool man, it’s so, it’s just ‘cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
Yeah, yeah.|Why can’t I find that?
Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!|Well, I want it!
Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!|You can have it!
Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!|I don’t know, maybe I can’t. I mean, maybe there’s something wrong with me.

Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?|Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to…
Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.|Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.|Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.|You have a Miss Monica Geller here.

Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip.|You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip.|Umm, I’m still here.
You’re taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us.|What?!
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights.|Okay, umm, you’re a loon.
Look, forget the check, okay.  I like you. I think you’re great. Come on, what do you say?|I don’t know.
Why not?|‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!|Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I’d curl up in it. Is that all right?|Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive.|What umm, what happened?
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.|Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together.|Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!|Oh, sweetie, oh.
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!|Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
What?|Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?|Okay.
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.|Okay, but.
Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!|
Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!|Guys, please, I’m just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?

I know it’s hard to hear, but it would’ve been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not.  Is that it, is that what it is?
Yeah, but not just that.|Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less…

Joe. How’s it going?|Yeah, that was real.
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.|I know.
What, so what are you gonna tell him?|Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.
Huh.|I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now.  Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.|I don’t have any issues with my Father.

What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?|No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?
Yes.|Yeah?
Yes, I do.|Good.

Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.|Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.|That’s not a state Joe.

Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.|So ah, we on for tomorrow?
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.|Absolutely!  Okay, I’m running out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I only attracted to guys where there’s no future? Either they’re too old, or they’re too young, and then there’s Pete who’s-who’s crazy about me, and who’s absolutely perfect for me, and there’s like zip going on! I mean, seriously, does it sound like something’s wrong with me?!
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?|Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’.  Nothing.
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?|Tasty! I’m really starting to feel like you guys have a history, it’s-it’s nice.
I have a question about this scene.|Yes?
Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor.|Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.
Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor.|Yeah.
I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.|Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.
It doesn’t say that in the script.|It does in mine!
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?|You bug me.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!|I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
You didn’t just break up.|Hey, it’s been like three weeks!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!|Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.
Okay.|She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.|Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Stop what?!|I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
No!! You can’t!!|Look, they must be stopped!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong!|I need juice! People need juice!!
Look man!|People need juice!
Listen to me!!|Juice, I need...
She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.|Yeah, okay.
Okay.|It’s just I miss her so much.
Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?|Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’
Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?|Y'know what?
No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to.|I can’t do this.
Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.|Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!|Oh God. I’m sorry about this.
That’s okay.|You sure?

And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.|One second.
Uh-oh, what did she do now?|Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.|God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.|Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.|Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!|Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?|Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’.  Nothing.

It isn’t?|No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!|Hey!
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!|Hey, Rach, how was work?
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!|Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn’t a chair.
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!|By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!|Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I’m just gonna throw it out, it’s probably just a bunch of shampoo and...
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!|Something wrong?
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!|
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?|Okay well, he would turn things to gold.

Okay, let’s play my game now.|Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what it’s like to be you?
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Wow, you’re really crazy about her, huh?
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we’re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it’s like somebody’s ripping out my heart!
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Oh, it’s so great to see you feeling like this!
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Hey!

Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|We were all pretty shaken up about it.
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Wait, am I missing something though? ‘Cause I thought death was something that’s supposed to be sad, in a way.
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch!  And I’m sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?

Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|No, just a barrel.
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Really?! Really?!
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
Hey, Sophie!|Hey, Rach!
Hey, Sophie!|Hey.
Hey, Sophie!|Hey.

Oh, Rachel,  actually, y'know what, forget it.|Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?|Uh, uh, uh, I am here.

I know!!!|So, I’m here, ready to play.
Okay.|I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
What’s this?|That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.
Not one that can pee on the roof.|Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
Not one that can pee on the roof.|And is this in case the house sneezes?
Not one that can pee on the roof.|No, no, that’s the ghost for the attic.
I don’t want a ghost.|Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
I don’t want a ghost.|Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
I don’t want a ghost.|Okay, obviously you don’t know much about the U.S. government.
I don’t want a ghost.|Hey!
I don’t want a ghost.|Hello.
I don’t want a ghost.|I need to talk to you!
I don’t want a ghost.|Sure, what’s up?

I don’t want a ghost.|Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
I don’t want a ghost.|Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...

I don’t want a ghost.|surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
I don’t want a ghost.|Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I’ll do it.
I don’t want a ghost.|Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she’s gonna love me.
I don’t want a ghost.|Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.|Okay,  fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.|Uh, Pheebs, while we’re hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don’t go, rrroof!
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.|The little ones do.
Hey, Kate!|Morning.
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...|Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...|Hi, oh, I’m Lauren, Kate’s understudy.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.|I know! I-I’m a big fan of yours.
What?!|I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
Get out of here, really?!|Absolutely!
Yeah?|Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
They gave me the shaft all right.|Oh, you’re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Well Ahh,  yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.|Cool! I-I’ll see you then.
All right.|All right, it’s time to act, my talking props.
Hey!|Hey!
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!|Wow!!
Look, look!|Hey, what’s this?!
Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.|It’s very interesting, Phoebe.
Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.|What’s this?
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.|This is the coolest house ever!!
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?|All right!
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?|I would!
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?|Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?|Uh-huh.
Watch, watch.|Ooohhhh!!
And, and!|Ahhhh!!
And, and!|Hey, my Father’s house does that!
And, and!|O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
And, and!|Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
And, and!|Hmm.
And, and!|Of course, I didn’t get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna’s such a big, dull dud!
Chandler is fantastic!!|What?!
Oh God, we just clicked! Y’know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?|Oh, I....
Oh, and he’s got such a good heart! Doesn’t he have a good heart?|Oh, I know...
Oh, I know and he’s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.|Isn’t this great?!
|That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
|He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you’re dating.
|Hey, I’m not interested in her sweater! It’s what’s underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I’m going out with?
|I don’t care. Why, do you want me to care?
|Do you want me to want you to care?
|Do you?
|What?
Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?|I’ve got no reason to stay.
Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?|Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I’ll see you in the morning.
Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?|I can’t believe we go on in, in a week.
Hey, it’s gonna be all right.|Hey! So since we’re getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
What?|You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.|Oh, okay.
Okay.|I’ll see you tomorrow.
Okay.|G’night.
Ah, are you okay?|Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
I don’t know.|Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
How do you mean?|Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.|Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.|And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!|And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Something like that?|Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind.
Hey.|Hi.
Hey.|Hi.
Hey.|It’s a little early to be drinkin’.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.|Ohhhhh!
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.|You’re kidding?! That’s great!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the  love making...|Oh my.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this.|I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this.|Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you’re going to call her?
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this.|That’s what you say at the end of a date.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this.|You can’t just say, ‘Nice to meet you, good night?’
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this.|To her face? Look it’s the end of the date, I’m standing there, I know all she’s waiting for is for me to say ‘I’ll call her’ and it’s just y'know, comes out. I can’t help it, it’s a compulsion.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this.|Come on Rach, when a guy says he’s going to call, it doesn’t mean he’s going to call. Hasn’t it ever happened to you?
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this.|Well, they always called.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this.|Hmm, bite me.
Did he call?|No. Sorry.
Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?|Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?|Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?|Well...
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?|No. I...
Call her! Call her now!|Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!|Oh, well give me the phone then.
Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!|Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’
Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.|Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!|All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
That’s fine!|That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Mon?|I’m in the shower!
Hey.|Hi.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?|About what?
Y'know, about what happened with us.|Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ah let’s not make a big deal about it, okay?
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.|Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all it was. Joey, I’m-I’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Nooo.|Hi, Kate!
Nooo.|Hi, Lauren.
Hi, Lauren.|Hi, pig!
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.|Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Yeah.|Hey!

Yeah.|What?! Oh my...  Oh my God!! What happened?!
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.|All right. Did everyone get out okay?
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.|Well, the giraffe’s okay. And so is the pirate.
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.|Ohh. What is this?
No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!|Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here,  and it’s all the time.|Well, thanks again for lunch.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.|It was, wasn’t it?
The food there was, was great.|Wasn’t it?
So take care.|You too.
Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.|Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.|Sophie’s desk.
Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.|Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
Noo!|Chandler!!
Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.|Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now.
Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.|What?
I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.|Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Yeah, o-okay.|So...
So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?|Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?|Oh my God, they took my idea!
So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?|That was you?!
So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?|Yeah! Okay, here you go.
So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?|Rachel, I made you a cocoa.
Oh my God, are you guys okay?|Are you all right?
Oh my God, are you guys okay?|Oh my.
Hey.|Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.|Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory. Okay?
Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.|Hey!

Ah, which ever is closest.|Okay.
So ask me what I did today.|So what did you do today Pete?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.|What?! Oh.
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?|What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues.  But Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.|And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.|Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.
What? Honey.|Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh God, I’m so sorry.|I know.
Oh God, I’m so sorry.|Ow!!
Oh God!|Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Oh God!|Got a job on a river boat?
Oh God!|Y'know what I didn’t wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You’re not my girlfriend anymore so...
Oh God!|Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
Oh God!|Right.
Oh God!|Now that you’re on you’re own, you’re free to look as stupid as you like.
Oh God!|You like it right?
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!|Yeah, come here!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?|Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?|Okay, good bye!
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.|Umm, oh, about three months.
Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.|Hey!!
Hey!|I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Okay.  It’s a chicken.|It’s cute, huh?
Okay.  It’s a chicken.|Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.|Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.|Oh, well no problem there.
So? I mean have you thought about it?|Okay. Here’s the thing.
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?|I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried about? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem.|Huh?
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.|Oh?
Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.|Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
I guess you can.|Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh!  All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
All right.|Okay.  Can you give me a little push?
Yeah, sure. Good luck!|I’m okay!! I’m all right!!
Yeah, sure. Good luck!|Wow! That’s exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
What?|I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?
Why would you say that?|‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
You’re good. You’re good!|Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.
Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?|Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Thanks a lot.|No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Okay, but this is the last time. -chickeeeen.|Hey.
Hey.|How’s she doing?
She?|Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?
I don’t know.  I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.|Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Excuse me?|What?
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!|Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
You don’t think I get up when you get up?|Ohhh, here it comes.
Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!|Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?|That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?|I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.
I’ll take her back tomorrow.|Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?
I’ll take her back tomorrow.|Hey!
Hey!|This blue suit, or this brown one?
Hey!|Well, the brown one brings out your eyes, but your butt looks great in the blue one.
Hey!|Really?
|Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Oww!|Oh my God, is that still...
I’m fine, I’m fine.|No you’re not.
Yes I am!|Rach!
Look, I’m fine. Watch.  Whoa-whoa!|Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.|And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you.  Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then.|Rach...
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.|Rachel...
Look, either help me or go.|Fine. I’ll go.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?|Sure. I’ll help you.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?|Oh, good! Good! Do you guys know how to get a chick out of a VCR?!
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?|Ohh.
|Okay. This stuff?
Yeah.|All right.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.|Oke-dokey.
Oh-ho!|Sorry.
Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!|Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close...
Okay, just sweep it.|I’m sweeping...
Right.|Sweep, sweep....
Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...|What? What?
We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.|No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this.  What?
Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?|Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little better, ‘cause, close-close...
Blow it.|Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.|What?
I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.|Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
I know.|Ooh, I have to tell you something.
What?|But I can’t tell you.
Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.|Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?|No.
Does it have to do with Joey?|No.
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?|No, but let’s come back to that later!
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?|Sure.
Yep?|Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?|Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Sure, okay.|Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
What?|I don’t want you to see me naked!
Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?|Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it’s weird.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.|What?
All I have to do is close my eyes. See?  Woo-hoo!!|Ross! Stop that!
Ah, I’m sorry.|Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend.  Oop, oh yeah!|Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen...  Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king.|Rosss...
Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.|All right.  Fine.
Yowzah!!!|O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?
Aww, come on.|That’s it.  Ow!!!
Oh my God!|Oh-ow!
All right.|Ow!
Look...|Ow!
Okay.|Ow!
Rach?|Ow! Ow!
Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?|Okay, I do.
Okay.|I really do.
Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in a cab.|Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.|Okay.
Okay?|Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?|I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this.
Does it involve travel?|Noo!
Does it involve clogs?|Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Clogs.|No.
Claws?!|No.
Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?|No!
What is it?! What about Pete?|I don’t know!
Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!|I can’t!!
Okay, I gotta go.|I, but you’re so close! No!
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company?|Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!
I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.|Hey!
Hey!|Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!|Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!|That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It’s gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.|So you like it?
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.|Oh, you’re welcome.
Did you just smell my hair?|Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Oh God.|What?
You still have feelings for me don’t you?|Now, nooo! I’m just excited about the restaurant, that’s all.
Pete.|Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.|Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.|What?
And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m sorry.|Okay, yeah. I mean... If that’s, if that’s really what you want, okay.
Okay, bye.|I’m sorry things didn’t work out...
Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?|Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray.
Okay.|Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
Okay.|That’s a duck.
Okay.|That’s a bad duck!!!  How’d the thing go tonight, Ross?
Okay.|Oh, it was, nah, well....
What thing? What thing?|Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on.  Easy.
What thing? What thing?|
What thing? What is this thing?|I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Oh my God!|Yeah.
Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?|Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
I cannot believe you.|What?
That is the sweetest thing, I just....|You should get some sleep.
Okay.|So, I’ll umm...
Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.|No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah, I’ll see you tomorrow.
See ya.|What did you do?
What ‘cha doing?|Having a swim.
What about the chick?|Chicks don’t swim.
Are you sure?|I don’t know. Should we try it?
Sure.|See, I told you they don’t swim.
Wait. Give him a minute.|Noo!  Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.|Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.
What’s Flimby’s?|Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.
Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!|No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!

Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!|Like a date type  person?
Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!|Yeah, kinda. It’s this woman from work. I hope that won’t be too weird. Will it, Rach?

All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|What if Joey were president?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Yeah.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Oh, ah with who?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren’t together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you’re not cool with it...
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She’s yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Oh!  That’s fine.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Great! Okay, good for you!
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?|I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get!|Hi!
It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get!|Monica!  Hi honey.
All right, on the table.|Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.
All right, on the table.|Oh, believe me, I don’t want to get hurt either. I’m being smart about this. See these guys? They’re the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin.  A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
All right, on the table.|Promise me you’ll be careful.
All right, on the table.|I promise.
All right, on the table.|Hey, are we still on for tonight?
All right, on the table.|Yeah.
All right, on the table.|Okay, good, ‘cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
No! No boom-boom before big fight!|How ‘bout just a boom?
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?|Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?|Hi!
This is Bonnie?  You’re Bonnie?|I can show you an ID if you want?
Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.|Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
Oh, that must be it.|Well I hope you have fun tonight.
Oh, that must be it.|Thanks! You too.
You said she was bald.|Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?|I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!|Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!|Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.
Why, does she have a bad personality?|Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!
Bing!|What is with him?
Bing!|With him? You’re is favourite, you’re his guy!
Bing!|We never get smacked.
Bing!|Well, that’s not true, he-he smacked you once.
Bing!|Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
Bing!|I’m telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?|No sir.
Hey!|God Ross, what is that?
Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!|From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
I love you, Pete!!!|And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!|Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him.
Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!|Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!|All right! You go get him! Let’s go!
Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!|Here we go gentlemen, here we go!  Let’s get it on!!
Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!|Uh-oh.
Hey!  It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.|It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant “You suck!”
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.|What, look back?
Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?|Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Well, no. But...|Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!|Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
You didn’t know that already?|Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Okay, just get a lot better.  Fast.|Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Hey.|Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.|Hot dog?
Four, please.|So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Four, please.|What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn’t expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn’t expecting to like anyone right now, but she’s really terrific.
Four, please.|Ohh, that’s too bad!
Four, please.|No, I-I’m saying I liked her.
Four, please.|Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
Four, please.|Pheebs, I think she’s great. Okay? We’re going out again.
Four, please.|Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
Four, please.|Hey! Which one’s my turkey burger?
Four, please.|Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
Four, please.|Hey, the fight’s starting!
Four, please.|Okay, we’ll be right in.  So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
Four, please.|Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
Four, please.|Fight’s over!
Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!|Bing! You got those numbers for me?
No, I ah, I didn’t do them.|Oh, you forgot?
No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.|Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller.  Bing!
Doug!!|Hmm.
I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.|Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.|Oh?
Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.|Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay.
Okay.|Ha!  Ahhhhhhh!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?|Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.
No! No! Look at that!  It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!|Phoebe!
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.|Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.|Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
You said it was okay!|You said she was bald!!
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!|Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?|Yes.
Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?|Yes.
So?|I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
Oh no.|What?
Oh, we killed them all.|Oh!
It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine.|Please tell me you’re stopping now.
I’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me.  See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zone of terror.|You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.|Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt.|Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.
Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this.|Then I’ve gotta go. Bye.
Mon-Monica?|Yes?
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up|Thank you, sir.
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up|Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard!  Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are ya?|No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you?|Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...|Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...|Oh, I can’t watch this.
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...|Check it out, he’s winning!  Pete’s winning!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...|Really?!

Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.|Oh! Oh!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.|Wait, if that’s his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.|Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn’t want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can’t.
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.|Ohh!!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.|Pan-ni Landrum & Mark J. Kunerth
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!|All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don’t know, we were, we were making out.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|Well, I think we all learned something.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.

I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|Y'know what that means?
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|That you’re actually 50?
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|Oh!
That is so cool.|I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
That is so cool.|Yeah! Yeah, we can!
That is so cool.|Shoot! I can’t go, I have to work!
That is so cool.|That’s too bad.
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.|So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.|Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.|You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Thanks!|Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend.
Yeah right.|Why is that so funny?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.|Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!|Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like  “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”
Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.|Hey!
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!|No, it’s just my luggage.
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!|Hey!!
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!|Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!|Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!|Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!|Oh, I wasn’t talking about his karma.
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!|Hey!

Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.|Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.|Ohh-ha-ha!
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.|Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Really?!|Ohh!

Ahh, no, I’m good.|Okay, I’ll see you in a bit.
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!|Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!|I don’t know.
You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!|All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?|Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
You still love me?|Noo.
You still love me.|Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?|Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...
What?!|I just, I feel, I-I just...
What?|I feel...
What?|Noo!! I don’t care! I’m not, I’m not gonna playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice!

No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!|Then don't break in!!
I’m sorry.|What are you doing here?!
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.|What?!
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you’re just mean!  So, just tell me the truth!|All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?|No, no, that’s just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I’m very sorry, but I don’t know where your Father is, and that’s the truth.
Oh.|But umm, you’re right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah,  okay. I’m your mother.
Heh?|Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!|That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants! Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.
I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!|Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don’t need that kind’ve hurt. Take it from a guy who’s never had a long term relationship......
I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!|I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!|Hey!

I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!|Hey, it’ll grow back, right? And she-she’s really fun, and she’s cool, and-and I’m finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I’m finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn’t work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you’re doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.|Yeah.
Hi there.|That’s that weird voice again.
Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening.  Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that’s good stuff!!|Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don’t really know what happened with that.
I’m your mother.|Ehh?
Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with a guy like Chandler...|
Hi!|Hi!
Hi!|Rachel was just helping me out. My head got all sunburned.
Awww.|Thanks a million.
Awww.|Oh, you’re welcome a million.
Awww.|Okay, I’ll see you in our room.
Yeah.|Oh my God.
Okay, I gotta go.|Whoa! What?! Why?!
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.|Here?! Now?!
Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.|Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...|Whoa-ho.
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?|I don’t know.
Yeah, yeah.  It wasn’t every morning.|Oh, making it worse!
So I guess you’d like to know how it all happened.|I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Noo! No! It wasn’t like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.|How close?
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.|I don’t even know how that would work!
Well, we were...|I’m not asking!
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it’s like to be eighteen years old?|Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Well, I’m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don’t know, you’re here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.|Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.
Wait!|I don’t ever want to see you again!
Wait!|Umm, where’s my purse?
Shoot! We’re out of soda.|Oh, I’ll go out and get you some.
Really?!|Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Really?!|Well, umm, my Mom’s friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom.
Really?!|I found a dried up seashores.
Sweety, what are you talking about?|Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner!
Sweety, what are you talking about?|Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don’t you wanna stay here and talk about it?
Sweety, what are you talking about?|No. I’m just, I wanna, I need to be alone.
Sweety, what are you talking about?|Monica!
It’s over.|Oh, was it awful?
Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head.  Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.|I wrote you a letter.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.|It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Okay.  So, I’d better get cracking on this baby.|Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.
Oh.|What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?
Done!|You just finished?
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!|So umm, does it?
I’m sorry.|Does it?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.|What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...
No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does.|Are you sure?
Oh, sure! I’m sure.|I know.
All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?|Ennnh.
I’ve got canned goods.|Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Excellent hole, Joe.|Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Excellent hole, Joe.|Ow!! Ow!!!
Excellent hole, Joe.|What?! What?!! What is it?!
Excellent hole, Joe.|Jellyfish sting! Oh, it hurts! It hurts!! It hurts!!
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!|It’s like two miles!
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!|Yeah, and I’m a little tired from digging the hole.
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!|Oh damn the jellyfish. Damn all the jellyfish!
We’ve got to do something!|Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.
We’ve got to do something!|What?! What is it?!
We’ve got to do something!|You’re gonna have to pee on it.
We’ve got to do something!|What?!! Gross!!
We’ve got to do something!|Don’t blame me, I saw it on The Discovery Channel.
Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.|Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that  baaad!!!!
Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.|If you want some privacy you can use my hole.
Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here!  But for you, yay! Ohh.|Hey!
Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here!  But for you, yay! Ohh.|How was the beach?
Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here!  But for you, yay! Ohh.|Nothing, I don’t know.
Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here!  But for you, yay! Ohh.|What happened?

Okay, I’m gonna put this  in the car.|Ooh, I have to go pack.  It really does?
Okay, I’m gonna put this  in the car.|It does. It really and truly does.
Okay, I’m gonna put this  in the car.|It so does not!!!
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her!  WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!|Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  Does it?!!”|No?
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  Does it?!!”|Look, Ross, you have what you want, you’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now you’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.|Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
What the hell happened on that beach?!|It’s between us and the sea, Ross!
Hi, Ursula.|Hey!
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.|Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
You know her?!|No, I umm, I read about her in Mom’s suicide note.
There-there was a suicide note?!  Well, do you still have it?|
I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!|Yeah. So how have you been doing?
“Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!|Well, it’s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Noooo!!|All right, hang on!
My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?|Nope.
My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?|Hey! Phoebe! We can talk to Phoebe!!
My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?|No. I’m-I’m to depressed to talk.
My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?|I’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?|Hey, you guys! What do you, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?
My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?|NO!!!
My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?|All right, that’s it, you guys! What happened out there?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.|Come on!
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.|What happened? Joey?
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.|All right.
No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!|They’ll never understand!
No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!|Well, we have to say something! We have to get it out! It’s eating me alive!! Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.|
I was in too much pain.|And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
I was in too much pain.|And then Joey remembered something.
I was in too much pain.|I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...
I was in too much pain.|Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
I was in too much pain.|Ewwww!!
You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So...|Ewwww!!
You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So...|That’s right I stepped up! She’s my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, I’d pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldn’t. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.
You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So...|Joey kept screaming at me, “Do it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!” Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.
You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So...|That’s ‘cause sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.
Except for you. You go away.|I’ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn’t been a day where I didn’t regret giving you up.
Okay, bye.|No, I’m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn’t look you up was, well I was afraid that you’d react, just well like, the way, the way you’re reacting right now, and can’t we just, y'know, start from here?
No.|Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I’m family, I’m it. Now, now I’m done.
But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?|Yeah, I guess you’re right.
It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.|Well, I don’t know. I mean it’s not like we don’t have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
I-I like pizza!|You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Oh my God, so do I!|I knew it, wow!!
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?|Ohh, so cute.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.|I know. I’m mad at me too.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.|Hey! Me too!
Oh-hooo, I missed you.|I missed you too.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?|I suppose.
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”|Umm-hmm.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!|Coffee house?
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!|You bet.
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!|Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!|What?!!
I fell asleep!|You fell asleep?!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!!  Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’|Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
|Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
|Hey!!
|I just feel bad about all that sleep you’re gonna miss wishing you were with me!
Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!|And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!|I KNEW IT!!!!
Gin.|We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Will you stop!|Okay. All right.
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!|How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!|Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.|All right. But, you’re gonna have to tell them.

Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you!  Oh my God.|What?
Nothing. Nothing.|What? What’s wrong?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.|You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.|Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?
No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling.  Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!|Dude, Phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...
No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling.  Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!|Let it go!!
Hey!|Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?|Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!
What, that little thing at the prom?|Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?|I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...|Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.|They had to have that specially made?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.|Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.|Oh, you go out with him.
Oh, really?!|Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?|Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are gonna work out.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?|Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?|Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?|Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced.  Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?|Why can’t you use the phone in here?
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?|Well, I’m returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?|Ross, don’t start.
Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!|I believe it.
No you don’t.|Yes, I do.
No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.|Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
I do not always have to be—okay, okay.|Jurassic Park could happen.
Wow! That’s ah, that’s pretty nice!|Pretty nice?
Wow! That’s ah, that’s pretty nice!|You’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We’ve got a canoe.|Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!|All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
You gotta take the canoe!|We’re not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
You gotta take the canoe!|Good for you!!
Look kinda familiar?|Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.
You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!|Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Do we have to tell her?|Yes, we have to tell her!
Do we have to tell her?|Oh, but it’s made her so happy.
Do we have to tell her?|Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
Do we have to tell her?|Yeah.
Do we have to tell her?|Thank you.
I hate when Ross is right!|He is right, isn’t he?
I hate when Ross is right!|Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he’s wrong.
I hate when Ross is right!|You think?
I hate when Ross is right!|Oh-no, he’s right.
|Hi!
|Hey!
|Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
Yeah?|How’s that going?
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.|That’s so sweet.
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.|
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.|Pheebs...
I just feel so, uhh.....|All right!!
I just feel so, uhh.....|I’m coming already!!
I just feel so, uhh.....|Jeez!
|Hello, Chip.
|Hey, Rach! How ya doin’?
|I’m great! I’m great. I’ve got a great job at Bloomingdale’s, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I’m not seeing anyone right now, I’ve never felt better about myself.
|So ah, Monica ready yet?
|She’ll be out in a second. So, Chip, how’s umm, Amy Welch?
|Amy Welch? Wow! I haven’t seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.|What?!
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.|No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.
Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.|All right, you have yourself a deal.
Here, we are.|Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
The what?|That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind.
No, I think it’s cute.|Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?|Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.|Is that all?
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.|Ohh, how is he?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.|Isn’t he an architect now?
OH MY GOD!!!|WHAT?!!
Are you all right?!|Yeah...
What happened?!!|Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!|Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!
So—You got in voluntarily?!|I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!|Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?
You know where I work!|I do?
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.|You still work at the multiplex?
Oh, like I’d give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.|Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.|Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.|Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.|Oh my God! What happened?
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.|Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
So, how was your date?|Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Um-hmm.|Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Oh honey, I’m sorry.|No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Ohh! That’s so great!|I know!
Ohh! That’s so great!|Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
Ohh! That’s so great!|Oh, they said uh, “You don’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.”
Ohh! That’s so great!|Okay, fine! Pheebs?
Ohh! That’s so great!|Yeah?  Hi!
Ohh! That’s so great!|Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
I’m sorry, sweetie.|Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
I’m sorry, sweetie.|Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
I’m sorry, sweetie.|That’s a good call. Right.
I’m sorry, sweetie.|No! No! Look—Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
I’m sorry, sweetie.|Ross, how many parents have you lost?
I’m sorry, sweetie.|None.
I’m sorry, sweetie.|Okay, then you don’t know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I’m wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
I’m sorry, sweetie.|I’m sorry.
I’m sorry, sweetie.|Okay.
I’m sorry, sweetie.|I don’t know what to say.
You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.|I think she would like that.
You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.|Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend’s mother.
You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.|Thank you. We both forgive you.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?|Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?|Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we’d really appreciate it.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?|Come on, Mom, I’ll take you home.
I’ll go with you.|Me too.
I’ll go with you.|Oh! Y'know, I’ve got an extra futon.
I’ll go with you.|Dude, you don’t have to brag! We got nothing here!!
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.|Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!
Huh?!|Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!|Could we be more white trash?
How desperate am I?|Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.
I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.|How come?
Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.|Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?|Just pickle.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?|Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.|Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?|No. No!
You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?|
You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?|Well, not at first.
I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’|Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!|Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.
Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end it.|Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.
Thank you.|I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
Thank you.|Yeah-eh-eah!  Oh-oh, sorry, I-I knew what he meant.
How’s the hired help?|Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
What’s this? Blue nail polish?|Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Ahh, that’s what your Grandmother’s hands looked like when we found her.|Let me ask you a question.
Hmm.|Why did you hire me?
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.|Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.|Okay, I didn’t hear that.
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.|Oh yeah, she didn’t hire me out of pity, it wasn’t so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks I’m good.
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.|Wow! And hey, it’s cool if you’re a lesbian!
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?|Uhhhh.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?|No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
…I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.|Oh yeah, I totally agree.
…I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.|Nooo!!
Excuse me, I’m sorry, you haven’t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?|Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
That’s weird.|What?
Your nails.|Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.
Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.|Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!
Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great.  Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.|Honey, don’t bite your nails.
Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great.  Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.|Okay ah, please don’t freak out. Umm, but ah, there’s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and there’s no way to know which one.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|I’m not freaking out.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|Then why are you laughing?
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|It’s nothing, it’s just that now your Father owes me five dollars.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|What? You bet I’d lose a nail?
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|Oh no, don’t be silly. I just bet I’d need these.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|Frozen lasagnas?
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|Um-hmm.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|You bet that I’d screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good was…
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|You promised Dr. Weinburg, you’d never use that phrase.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, you’ve never been able to laugh at yourself.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|That’s right. My Mom doesn’t have any faith in me! Oh, that’s hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
I don’t get it.|No, I have faith…
I don’t get it.|
I don’t get it.|Ding!
It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.|No, we are. I’m sad.
Okay.|Unbelievable!!
Thanks.|No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Okay.|What are you doing?
I’m getting dressed.|Why?
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.|Wait. I wanna show you something.
What is it?|Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.  Put your hands together.
Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me.  Ooh, saucy.|
You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?|Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kinda exciting.
Oh.|Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose.|That’s weird, she locked the door.
Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose.|Y’know why? She’s got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.
Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose.|Okay, swear you won’t tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joanna’s office. Do you wanna see the list?
Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose.|Yeah!
Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose.|Hi!  How are you?
Hello, Joanna……’s office.|I’m really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
How little?!|A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!|I can’t!!
Why not?!|I’m in my boss’s car!
What?!|Uh-oh, tunnel.
What?!|Rachel, could I see you for a moment?
What?!|Okay, here’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.
You promised you would break up with her!|I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!|It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.|No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it!  You never see Joanna again!|Never!
You never come into this office again!|Fine!
You give me back my Walkman!|I—never borrowed your Walkman.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!|You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!
Does it hurt?|No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?|About what?
When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!|I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!|Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!
No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!|Well, this is much better.
So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?|He cut off his ear.
And?|I’m out.
He painted that.|Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Let’s see, ahhh… Where does the Pope live?|In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?|Spock’s birth control.
Hey!|Hi.
This used to be your room?  Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.|Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.|Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.|What?
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one’s outta here." Though some things don’t change.|All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.|Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?|It still wouldn’t be clean.  All I want is my freedom.
Foot rubs for a month!|Freedom!
I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!|Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!
No! God, would you just calm down!|I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just…
Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit.|So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.|Well ah, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?|You don’t have, anything?
You wanna see what I got?  Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!|Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
And a 50.  Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.|For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.|No!
I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!|With extra pulp?
Yeah!!|No!
D’oh!!  I’ve got it!|You don’t have it.
I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.|How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  stingy.|Go on.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.|And Milton Berle has a…
Well?|They’re not even touching the lasagna!
Really?!|Oh, they love your casserole.
Yes!!|It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
Yes!!|Well, everyone seems to be enjoying your dish.
And you?|I thought it was… quite tasty.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…|A bitch?
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.|Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
Wow!|Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica.
Wow!|And the next time you cater for me, there will be nothing but ice in the freezer.
Hello.|Hey!
Hello.|
|Wh-what’s going on?
|Oh.
|No he doesn’t!
Two hours, that lasted!|So did you break up with Joanna?
I think so.|Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
I think so.|The volcano?
I think so.|Yeah. And speaking of volcanoes, man are they a violent igneous rock formation.
I think so.|What?!
I think so.|Oh yeah, lava spewing, hot ash, of course some are dormant.
I think so.|Why are you talking about volcanoes all of the sudden?
I think so.|Well, we can talk about something else. What do you want to talk about? Vivisection? The Vasdeferens? The Vietnam War?
I think so.|Oh! Did anybody see that-that documentary on the Korean War?
I think so.|Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I think so.|Oh God, Korea is such a beautiful country.
I think so.|With such a sad history.
Who’s out there?|It’s me! Good morning!
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?|Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I…  Oh my word!
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.|Oh, yeah! Yeah!
You tell your friend Chandler that we’re definately broken up this time.|Okay.
Hey! New wallet, huh?|Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.
Hey! New wallet, huh?|Rachel!
Hey! New wallet, huh?|What?
Hey! New wallet, huh?|You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!
Hey! New wallet, huh?|Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.
Hey! New wallet, huh?|Have you ever taken out the trash?
Hey! New wallet, huh?|Well, I thought you liked doing it.
Hey! New wallet, huh?|Third door on the left.
Hey! New wallet, huh?|Right!
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.|: Hey.
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.|: What are you doing?
Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry.  It’s a little old but…|: No! You’re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.|: Oh yeah, of course you don’t!
No.|: ‘Cause you’re a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me…"
I didn’t… I never said that.|: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don’t think of someone else for a change?
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?|Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.|Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.
I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.|That’s easy for you to say, you weren’t almost just killed.
All right that’s it, school is in session!|My God! Is this a gym card?
All right that’s it, school is in session!|Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I’ve missed the last 1200 times.
All right that’s it, school is in session!|So why don’t you quit?
All right that’s it, school is in session!|You don’t think I’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria.
All right that’s it, school is in session!|Who is Maria?
All right that’s it, school is in session!|Oh Maria. You can’t say no to her, she’s like this lycra spandex covered gym…treat.
All right that’s it, school is in session!|You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?
All right that’s it, school is in session!|No!
All right that’s it, school is in session!|So you’re strong enough to face her on your own?
All right that’s it, school is in session!|Oh no, you’ll have to come.
: Tribbiani! Hold on, I’ll get the plunger.|Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
: And tell him what?|Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
: Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!|I have actually not heard of that.
: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief. I’m gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother’s apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.|Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!|What’s the matter?
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.|So do them for free.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.|They make you take an oath?
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.|Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?
No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional.|Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional.|Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.
No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional.|Because that’s the only part of you he can see when he’s on the table!
No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional.|You’re gonna do some feet flirtin’!
I don’t what your talking about.|Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Oh! My hero! What happened?|Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later.
Oh! My hero! What happened?|What a minute, what did he say?
Oh! My hero! What happened?|He said that he wasn’t gonna apologize because you guys are living here illegally, so instead what he’s gonna do is have you evicted—I’ll see you later.
What?! You got us evicted!!|I told you not to go down there!
What?! You got us evicted!!|Well he made Rachel cry!
What?! You got us evicted!!|Rachel always cries!
That’s not true!|Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!
That’s not true!|All right! I’ll try! But if I can’t, you can stay with Chandler and I until you get settled.
Go!!|All right, all right, all right.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.|Yes.  Yes!
One more time, "Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"|No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Good! That’s good!|Okay.  I wanna quit the gym.
Good! That’s good!|You wanna quit?
Good! That’s good!|I wanna quit the gym.
Good! That’s good!|You do realize that you won’t have access to our new full service Swedish spa.
Good! That’s good!|I wanna quit the gym.
Good! That’s good!|Okay, Dave in the membership office, handles quitters.  are you a member?
Me? No.|Sorry, members only.
Me? No.|I wanna quit the gym.
It’s okay man, be strong.|So, are you a member of any gym.
No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.|Okay, no problem.  Could you come here for a second?
No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.|Hi, I’m Maria.
Wow, you have really pretty feet.|These old things.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it’s been killing me today.|You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Yeah.|Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real  nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.|Oh.
Ow! Did you just bite me?|No!
: What?|Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there fault, it was mine.
: You want me to kick you guys out instead?|No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
: You have pets!|Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.
: Huh, I would’ve thought it was the other way around.|Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want.
: Really? You’ll do anything?|Yeah-yeah, absolutely.

Well, you could actually go to the gym.|No, I know! I-I’m sorry, but the moment I touch him, I just wanna throw out my old oath and take a new, dirty one.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.|Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I don’t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!

We’d like to close our accounts.|Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
No-no.|No, we’d just like to close them.
No-no.|Okay, Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.  Would you come over here please?

Really?!|Yeah, really.
What?|Suddenly, I very aware that I’m naked.
|Mr. Simon’s been waiting for— Oh my God!
|Why wasn’t I offered that? I’d definitely pay more for that.
|Phoebe, we have rules here, this isn’t that kind of place.
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn’t what it looks like, ‘cause Rick is my ahh, husband.|Oh really? Well, then you’d better tell his other wife, ‘cause she called three times asking where he is.
So you didn’t leave the bank?|No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
So you didn’t leave the bank?|What are you ever gonna use that for?!
So you didn’t leave the bank?|To pay for the gym.
So you didn’t leave the bank?|Hey.
So you didn’t leave the bank?|Hey! So I had a great day, Rick and I really hit it off, and we started making out, and then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.
So you didn’t leave the bank?|What?!
So you didn’t leave the bank?|You got fired?!
Oh my Gosh!|It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
Oh my Gosh!|Sweety...
Oh my Gosh!|I just-I just started walking around not knowing what to do next, y’know? I-I started asking people on the street if they wanted massages. Then these policemen, thought I was a whore too. It’s been a really bad day, whore wise.
Oh my Gosh!|: Hey Duck, is Chick here?
Oh my Gosh!|Yeah… Bunny-rabbit.
Oh my Gosh!|So you ah, ready for our last practice?
Oh my Gosh!|: Yeah, but y’know, I think the reason we’re not getting that spin right is because my apartment’s too small.
Oh my Gosh!|Look, you wanna use our place?
Oh my Gosh!|: No, I ahh, had another idea.
We did it!!|: I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.|: Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
Oh well, okay, good luck.|: Yeah.

Okay.|: Yeah.
Go get ‘em Treeger.|: Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Really?|: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she’s the same size as me.
So it looks like you’ve got some great experience here. Let’s see ahh, reason for leaving last job?|Yeah, they thought I was a whore.

Oh my God! That's why I got up too!|You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...|Oh please!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.|Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.

Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.|Hey!

Hey.|Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
Hey.|Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
Hey.|Hi, Josh.
Hi.|Dudes.
Hi.|So, did you play in college?
Hi.|Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
Hi.|Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
Hi.|Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
Hi.|Okay.  I'll miss you.
Hi.|Dope!
Wow, cute one!|Very!
Wow, cute one!|I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
Wow, cute one!|Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
Wow, cute one!|Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
Wow, cute one!|Oh!
Wow, cute one!|What was that?
Wow, cute one!|Monica knows.
Wow, cute one!|It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
Wow, cute one!|Well, I'm gonna go get ready,  for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
Hi!|Hi!
Hi Ben!|Wow! You-you look great!
Thanks!|Hey Tommy.

Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy!  Kathy.|Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"|Hey!
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.|Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.|Pheebs, what are you doing?
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.|Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.|Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.|What?!
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.|Are you serious?
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.|Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.|I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person.  No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.|You mean you stole it!  Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.|Hey.
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.|We were just talking about you.
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.|Really?!
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.|Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.|Right in there!
99...100! Ready or not, here I come!  All right, let's go over the concept one more time.|Hey!
Hey!|Hey guys.  Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.|It's 4:30.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.|Okay, I see what's going on here.
You-you do?|Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
You got me.|Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Yeah. Right.|Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Ross isn't here.|Oh.  Stop it!
Ross isn't here.|So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
Ross isn't here.|Yeah!  Ohhh!
What?|I think he's stealing from me.
Why?|Because he's stealing from me!
Why?|Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
Why?|Ughh!
Why?|Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
Thank you so much Phoebe.|Sure.
What are you doing with those?!|But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Sorry, Phoebe.|It's okay. How's the soup?
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!|Is she great or what?
So? Huh? What do you think?|Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!|Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!|Uhh, no-no thanks.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|What was that?
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|What?
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|Hey, look, what do you want from me?
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|I am pretending.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|Well then, do it better!
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her?  No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?|No, sorry.
So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?|Well where's Amanda?
So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?|Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?|I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?|Ross, cough drops, please?
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.|Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...|You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
You see Amanda and I have a very special...|Ohh, that is soo sad.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...|And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
You see Amanda and I have a very special...|Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
You see Amanda and I have a very special...|That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
Fine.|Sorry.
Here.  At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.|Y'know...
Does it even work without my sexy voice?|I like it.
Gunther, kiss me.|What?
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|Rachel?
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|Yeah.
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|No!
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|Okay.
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|So umm, are we cool?
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|Okay.
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|I knew you'd understand.
So, thank you for the delicious dinner.|You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Hey what are you guys looking at?|Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
I know!|Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
I know!|Where did you, when did you, how did you...  How did you get a girl like that?
I know!|Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.|Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.|Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?|Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.|Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Well, I have a call in about that.|'Kay.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.|Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.|Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.|Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.|Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
It doesn't say that. Does it?|How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|Oh my God! What happened?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|Sixty guests.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican...  ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|I don't know.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|Well, you're not working either.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|Yes, but I'm doing this.
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
Hey!|Hey.
Hey!|Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
You can pee here!|Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
You can pee here!|It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway.  Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?|Yeah!
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?|Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
Oh, I know...|And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?|No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Hey!|Hey, how'd it go?
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!|Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.  Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!|I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look—I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.|Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
Huh...|Um, would you like to come in?
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?|According to recent findings!
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!|Mitzi is.....
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.|...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
What?|Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
I'd rather not.|Oh, yeah, why not?
Oh, is everything in the car?|Yes. Did you settle the bill?
No. I hate this part.|Oh, look what we almost left.
No, that's not mine.|Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.|Oh, good. Thank you.
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...|Dear?
Just the matter of ...payment?|
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.|Sure...
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?|I don't know... um, Grease?
No....|Rent?
Yes! Rent!|Okay, so when do you want to go?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.|Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.|Yes, it is, at Office Max.
What did you get her?|A pen.
What did you get her?|It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
What did you get her?|Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
What did you get her?|Why not?
What did you get her?|Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|For three years?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
But Mon, you have to get our money!|Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?|What?
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"|Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.|Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....|She seems fine now.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?|You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Yeah.|Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?|What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.|No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
What kind of smell?|I don't know. Soap?
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?|Yeah.
You wanna see her again, right?|Yeah.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!|Yeah, okay you're right.
Yeah.|I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Yeah!|It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.|Any luck?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy."  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?|All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.|Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?|Oh! Pathetic!
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?|Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
Where?|Our place, the hall! I...
I got something for her.  It's a book!|Is it like a book that's also a safe?
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?|You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one.  Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
No, it came out to an even twenty.|Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
You didn't get the money, did you?|Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough!  Hey, widow?|Come on along and listen to...
Okay, Widow!|...the lullabye of...
Excuse me. Excuse me!  Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.|All right. I'll get my bag.
Good.|I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
So you want to come inside?|
Guess who?|Department of Sanitation?
It's me!|Oh!
What?|Ah, Cheryl!
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!|Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Uh... yay!|Thanks!
Uh... yay!|Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
Uh... yay!|Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
Uh... yay!|Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.|And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!|Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Okay!|I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!|Aah!
Hey!|Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.|Oh yeah? That's great!
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!|[nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....
Hey.|Hey!
Hey.|Hey! Happy birthday.
Thank you!|You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.
Thank you!|No he didn't. [Moving it back.]
Thank you!|Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
Thank you!|Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
You really didn't have to.  Wow.|See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .|Oh, yeah... yeah.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .|Ah. Hm.  Wanna go to bed?
I'll be in in a minute.|Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
I'll be in in a minute.|[to Kathy] Goodnight.
Um, thank you for the gift.|Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.|Uh, the book?
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.|What do you mean?
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.|Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.|Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Well....|Goodnight.
Well....|Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.|Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!|Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth!|Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?

Here you go.|Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.
Great!|Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
Great!|That would be Casey. We’re going out tonight.
Great!|Goin’ out, huh? Wow! Wow!  So things didn’t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.
Great!|No, things are fine with Kathy. I’m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.
Great!|What?
Great!|Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself!
Great!|Wait! You’re going out with Kathy!
Great!|Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?
Great!|Well, I’m upset—for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.
Great!|What is the big deal? It’s not like we’re exclusive.
Great!|Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she’s-she’s smart, and funny, and gets you.
Great!|You got all that from the back of her head?
Great!|All right look, I think it’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.
Great!|Who’s Elaine?
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse.|Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease…  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’|Well umm, y’know, I used to play.
Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?|Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.
Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?|Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.
Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?|Yeah.
Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?|He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."
I wanna hear "The Sound."|Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?
Come on, play that funky music white boy.|Yeah!

Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay?|Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!

Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay?|What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus it’s just, it’s so different from the stuff you usually hear.
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay?|You mean like, music?
Come in!|Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.|So is Joey around?
No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?|I uh, don’t really have a preference. You?
I like it in the stern.  Hello.|Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
What happened?|We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.
Why can’t you tell her?|‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—
Joey! Joey!!|Yeah?
I thought your time ran out.|Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—
Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry.|Oh.
So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.|Oh, okay.
Yeah, I think it is!|So what did you do today?
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…|Oh, it looks great!
…and then it got canceled.|Well, I could cut it.
Really?! You do that?|Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt’s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
You have really great hair.|Well, thanks. I grow it myself.  Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I’m basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.|What-what ‘cha doin’?
Checking to see if it’s even.|‘Kay.
Looks good.|Hello!
Looks good.|Hey dude, it’s me.
Looks good.|Hey it’s Joey!
Looks good.|Listen uh, I’m really sorry, it looks like I’m gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasn’t there!
Looks good.|What?
Looks good.|Yeah, it must’ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.
Looks good.|Okay.
Looks good.|Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.
Looks good.|Oh yeah man.
I should uh, probably go.|Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
I forgot my purse.|Oh.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!|Horrible!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?|No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Okay!|No, but that’s bad!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.|What?!
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?|Can you really do that?
I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.|Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you…
Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn.|I’m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
I-I think we have too.|Okay. Bye.
Bye.  Are you still out there?|
Emphatic time-time-time…|Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Emphatic time-time-time…|It’s so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|Hey, aren’t you up next?
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|Oh no, I’m not playing tonight.
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|Why not?
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|I can’t follow Ross! It’d be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|Phoebe, Ross sucks!
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|Oh my God, he’s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|Yeah, Phoebe you’re… awful!
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|You guys. You suck too.
Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again!|Hang on buddy!
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?|I sure did.
Why?|Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Well, you’re amazing.|Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?|Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.|Oh, I don’t know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.|You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.|Or Casey.
No-no, Kathy.|Could be Casey.
No. No, Kathy.|Consider Casey.
Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?|That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Hey!|Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?|Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Pheebs…|Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.|Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.|Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.|I kissed Kathy.
What?|Are you serious?
What?|Does Joey know?
What?|No. Is there anyway, anyway you think he’ll understand this?
What?|You obviously haven’t screwed over a lot of your friends.  Which we all appreciate.
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.|Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.|I think maybe, yeah.
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.|He loves you.
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.|Then why didn’t you tell me to do that?!!
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.|Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.|I know, I remember that!
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.|I remember you did.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.|God!!  What am I gonna do?!
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.|Well, Chandler, you’re gonna have to tell him.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.|Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.|Because you do.
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.|Yeah, I know.
Hey!|Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Is that a real thing?|Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.|What’s up?
It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.|You do?
Yeah.|Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.
What?|Yeah, she broke up with me.
Oh uh, when?|Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?|Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?
Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.|No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.
Yeah?|Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.|But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…
See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.|Who?
It’s me. I’m the other guy.|What?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…|And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.|What?!! That’s even worse!!
How is that worse?!|I don’t know! But it’s the same!
Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!|Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.|Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!|Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!
Probably because…|Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either.
Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.|What?
Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.|Phoebe, his music could not get any worse. There are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.
Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.|Thank you, thanks.  would you, can you finish my set?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.|Yeah, like I could lose it.
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.|What?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.|I played bad on purpose guys.
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.|Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.|Yeah—no, just that last song.
Hello.|
Hello.|Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I’m…
Stop callin’!!|Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
All right!|What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything…
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!|Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!|So are things with you and Joey any better?
They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.|Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.|Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.|You shouldn’t.
They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.|Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there’s the added mystery of who gets who.
They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.|Who gets whom.  I don’t know why I do that.
Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.|We haven’t eaten yet!
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it’s like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let’s trade!
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Oh that’s not true! That’s not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it…  Her initials…
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Ohh.
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Op, y'know what though, it’s kind’ve a girlie briefcase.
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Who cares? He works in a museum!
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|You don’t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren’t here, you can watch the parade if you want.
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Thanks.
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|What is wrong with this freezer?!  Ow! Ow!!
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|God, what happened?!
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
People are trying to sleep in here!|Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
People are trying to sleep in here!|Open it up, let me see.
People are trying to sleep in here!|Oh, y’know what, I can’t, it really kills.
People are trying to sleep in here!|Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
People are trying to sleep in here!|Ooh, God it looks bad.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.|No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.|He’s really picky about his patients.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.|Honey, you’ve got to go. What’s his office number?
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.|Like I remember his office number!  Speed dial 7.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.|He’s out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.|Yes!!
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.|Yes! She’s very excited about that.
This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions.|Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Okay, get out of my kitchen!|I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|Oh y’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|Really?! Wow! That’s-that’s so nice, what are you gonna get me?
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|I don’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|Oh no-no-no, you don’t want to do that, then you’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|Oh, that’s not true! I’ve got her lots of stuff she never took back.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|Like?
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|When was the last time you saw her wear it?
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh…
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|Big dog?
Hey!|Hey!
What are you doing?|I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Everything? Even the TV?|No! I’m putting that in my room.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?|Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?|Five years.
You’ve sentenced him?!|Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.
Joey, the guy’s your best friend.|No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.
Oh, who? Me?|Yeah!
Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?|What?
I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.|All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?|I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?|Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
Oh my God, is it really that bad?|I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
Oh.|Hey Joe.
Oh.|
I’ll be right with you. Okay?  Thanks, Wendy.|Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
I’ll be right with you. Okay?  Thanks, Wendy.|Ooh, so cute, that I’m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
I’ll be right with you. Okay?  Thanks, Wendy.|Dr. Burke will see you know.
I’ll be right with you. Okay?  Thanks, Wendy.|Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
I’ll be right with you. Okay?  Thanks, Wendy.|Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
I’ll be right with you. Okay?  Thanks, Wendy.|Ready?
Hey! I’m sorry! That— where are you going?|My folks.
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?|I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
What?!|Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?|Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!|Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.
All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!|When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
What?|Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?|We’ve got a box.
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.|I was probably waiting for it to open.
I gotta tell you, you look great now.|You look great too.
You’re an excellent patient!|So how does it look?
Well, you’ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.|Like a pirate?!
If that helps you.|Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad?  Come on, one of us had to mention him.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.|Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Uh.|No way!
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend’s.|Oh.
But we broke up.|Oh.
She-she wasn’t ready for a serious commitment.|So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
You’re not wearing the patch yet.|I know.
He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!|I know, it’s sick.
He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!|Why is it sick?
He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!|Because it’s Richard’s son! It’s like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!|Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don’t you?
He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!|Yeah, I can see where I’d be your best shot but, no. I’m sorry, but I think it’s twisted.
Yeah.|What’s twisted?
Yeah.|Me going out with Richard’s son.
Yeah.|Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
Yeah.|Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
Yeah.|Is he okay in there?
Yeah.|He’s fine!
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.|Fine! Judge all you want to but,
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.|So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.|Chandler?
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.|The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it hurts!
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?|Why?
I just wanna check something.|Okay.
Now, we’ll see.|Air hole! Air hole!!
Now, we’ll see.|Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.|Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!|Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
What did you get?|Credit.
What did you get?|Hi, Tim.
What did you get?|Hi.
What did you get?|Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
What did you get?|Hi, nice to meet you.
What did you get?|And Joey.
What did you get?|Hey!
What did you get?|Hi, Joey.
What did you get?|My brother, Ross.
Hey.|And Rachel.  And that’s Chandler.
Hey.|How do ya do.
Hey.|What’s…
Hey.|Umm, well, he’s…
Hey.|He’s doin’ some thinkin’!
What happened? What happened?!|You kissed my girlfriend!
What happened? What happened?!|Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
What happened? What happened?!|Like ‘em, like ‘em? Or, I’d like to get store credit for that amount like ‘em?
What happened? What happened?!|
What happened? What happened?!|All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
What happened? What happened?!|Where can I wash up?
What happened? What happened?!|Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
What happened? What happened?!|Thank you.
What happened? What happened?!|Fancy soap? I thought we were savin’ that for the Pope!
What happened? What happened?!|See he’s nice. Right?
What happened? What happened?!|Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That’s not how your dad used to do it."
What happened? What happened?!|Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
What happened? What happened?!|I saved you a seat.
What happened? What happened?!|Sick-sick-sick-sick.
What happened? What happened?!|Oh, I’ll get it.
Gotcha!|That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!
Sorry!|Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Okay, okay, you got it!|Ross, can you pass me the yams?
Okay, okay, you got it!|Sure! Oh, and Joey’s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
Okay, okay, you got it!|Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
Okay, okay, you got it!|Oh-ho-ho, we’ve got company.
Okay, okay, you got it!|There’s nothing the matter with me. See, I’m not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
Okay, okay, you got it!|Okay, fine.
You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!|All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!
You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.|So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Absolutely!|That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?  Okay.
Absolutely!|Don’t say that I have no sentiment!  This is from the museum from the first time we… were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
Absolutely!|I don’t know what to say, I’m sorry. Though, you’re not supposed to take these.  It’s like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
|Here, let me help.
Thank you.|You-you have a very beautiful… eye.
Y’know all my friends think this is weird.|Y’know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn’t.
I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.|Oh, I totally agree.
We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?|What?
Nothing. Nothing.|No-no really, was-was that not okay?
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…|Oh my God! It didn’t remind you of…
Don’t say it!|No, but it did! Didn’t it?!
Yeah!|Oh man!!
I’ll get it.|Oh.
Hey.|Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am…
That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.|Well, I’m still sorry. Is he here?
In the box.|Chandler?
In the box.|Oh, he-he can’t talk right now.
In the box.|Why not? What’s going on?
In the box.|He’s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
In the box.|By being in a box?
In the box.|Joey, had reasons.
In the box.|They were threefold.
In the box.|Oh. Well uh,  Listen I don’t wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can’t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don’t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don’t think we can see each other anymore. I’m gonna go to my mom’s in Chicago, I’m gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could’ve be something really amazing, but y’know this is probably for the best. Y’know? I’m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
|What?!
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there!  Get out of there!|So?
Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!|Yeah?
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.|Man, this is…
Oh, he sees her!|Oh, he’s catching up to her!
Oh, he sees her!|Oh, she sees him! Oh, they’re hugging!
Oh, he sees her!|He’s taking her purse!
Oh, he sees her!|Uhh, that’s not them. I’m gonna go call the police.
Oh, he sees her!|Oh, there they are!
Oh, he sees her!|All right, get a room.
Okay!|Come on, no peeking!
Okay!|Our eyes are closed and we’re about to cross the street. Very good.
Okayyyyy, open up!|What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Yeah, it’s for our catering business!|I think I know that girl.
Yeah, it’s for our catering business!|All right, umm, we’re not gonna really keep it this way though.
Yeah, it’s for our catering business!|No?
No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.|Oh!
And also, we don’t know what to do with this.|Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?|Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.|How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.|Yay!!
Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.|Oh, in that case— That was me hopping on board.
Oh.|Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
Oh.|I don’t know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there’s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
Oh.|No-no, I don’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
Oh.|Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
Oh.|Kathy’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
Oh.|Dude, we are sooo gonna party!

Oh.|This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
Oh.|Woooo!!!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?|Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?|Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?|Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?|Gandolf the wizard.  Hello! Didn’t you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?|No, I had sex in high school.
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…|Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…|Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can’t stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.|Really? Well, in that case…
And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.|That’s fine, actually I’m on the hiring committee, so there’ll be at least one friendly face.
Ohh! That’s great!|You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Really?!|No-ho-ho!  I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don’t you worry, I’m sure with your qualifications you won’t need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Well, I, umm…|Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!|Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.
Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!|Really?!
Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.|Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.|All right, I’ll see you guys.
It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.|Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!|I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!|Somewhere maybe along the equator?
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!|Okay.
|What happened?
He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.|Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|Thank you.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?  It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|I notice that you’ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It’s amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|Oh yes, well there’s the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!
Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.|Yes, I realize that…
Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.|And Rachel shouldn’t have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.|I love working with designers!
Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.|With them, under them, what’s the difference? Eh, Rach?
Hey! My first review is out!|Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
All right, look at my on the back page.|Oh, okay!  Wow! You really laid into this place.
Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.|Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?|No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?
Haven’t we made this decision?|Yeah, all right.
Bye!|Bye!
Who is it?|It’s Allesandro, from Allesandro’s.
Oh my God.|I want to talk to you about your review.
Oh my God, oh my God.  Call me on the phone!|Why? So you could hang up on me?
Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.|Just give me a chance too…
Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.|Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
No! Phoebe!|Hey, Monica!
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!|I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.|The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!|All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.|Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Lebanon.|Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.|I thought it went very well.
No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about.  I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.|Rachel, please, don’t make a scene.
There’s nobody here!|Sophie, get in here!  You see! Now you’re making Sophie uncomfortable!
There’s nobody here!|She’s not making me uncomfortable.
There’s nobody here!|Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
Do you want me to quit?|What?! What would make you think that?
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk,|Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it’s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
What?|That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking…
My drinking?|Oh, I must’ve said that after you left.
Said what? Exactly.|That you enjoyed the occasional drink…ing binge.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!|Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it! I don’t want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.|You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
I’d need an expense account.|Done!
And an assistant.|Sophie, get in here!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.|It’s Gandolf, and he’s not coming.
So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?|No! I balanced my checkbook.
So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?|Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?|I can’t believe he didn’t come!
So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!|Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!
So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!|Yeah! We’d meet, we’d meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
Well, we could do that!|There’s other stuff too.
We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!|Yeah!
Yeah!|Yeah!!
Yeah!!|It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!
Yeah! All right? Let’s go!|And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Yeah! All right? Let’s go!|Yeah!!!
Yeah! All right? Let’s go!|All right!!
Yeah! All right? Let’s go!|Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
Yeah! All right? Let’s go!|Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
Yeah! All right? Let’s go!|Yeah.
Yeah! All right? Let’s go!|Well, those were seals, man.
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?|Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I’m soo happy!|Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Ohh, you’ve waited soo long.|Hey!
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.|Yeah.
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?|I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and…  You got the job!!

Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything.  I’m gonna have walls!|It’s okay, ‘cause y'know what? You don’t really need me for the business.
Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything.  I’m gonna have walls!|You’re the cook! With out you it’s just me driving up to people’s houses with empty trays and asking for money!
Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything.  I’m gonna have walls!|All right. But umm, I-I-I’ll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.

All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we’ll head back out.|Okay.
So, we’re having fun, right?|Yeah.
We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.|I’m kinda beat.
We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.|Actually, me too.
Are you serious?!|Yeah.
Thank God! I’m exhausted!|So you guys want coffees?
Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.|Yeah, me too.
Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.|Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.|I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.
I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.|How sad are we?
Yeah, I know.|Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Yeah, I know.|Yeah!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.|Yeah!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.|And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.|Okay, I’m hearing.
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.|What?!
Or! A bakery delivery person.|I wa-I wa-I wa…
Pizza?!|Monica!
All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.|No.
Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.|No.
Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.|Really?! Are you sure?
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.|Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception.  Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Really?!|Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.
Thank you.|Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?|Oh my goodness! You haven’t heard!
Heard what?|Joanna passed away last night.
Oh my God! How?!|Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!|I know!
Oh, God. Oh, God.  Oh God.|I didn’t realize that she was so close.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.|No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?|
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?|Good morning!
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…|I sure did!
I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it’s like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we’re gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.|Umm, I just wanna say, uh  Are you gonna kill me?
Hey!|Hey!
I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?|Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
15?|Where were you?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.|Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.|Oh, which museum?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.|No, answer his.
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.|Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.|How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.
No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.|Done! I did it! Heh, who’s stupid now?
Hey, look at this!  They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.|Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.|Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody!  I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.
Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.|Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.
Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.|Well, I know what I’m giving you for Christmas.
Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?|Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.|Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|Hey!
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|What’s wrong Mon?
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|Oh.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|Hey, maybe they meant to write, ‘Quiet, bitch.’
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|Hey, honey! What’s the matter?  Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|Ohhh!
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|I mean they’re trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something I’ve been waiting for my whole life.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|Well, wait a minute, you’re the boss! Why don’t you just yell at them? Or, fire them?
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|I would love too, but I can’t! I mean I just can’t, you know that I’m not good at confrontation.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.|Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.|That’s a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.|Good enough to get fired.
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.|All right, you’re hired!
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.|Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now?  Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!|I didn’t think you were gay. I do now.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.|Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.
Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.|Oh wow! I’m free for her!
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.|Oh, wait a second! I didn’t say I wasn’t free!
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.|Hey, Chandler, why don’t we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.|Hold on, y’know I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?
Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!|Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?|Yes!
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!|Pheebs, that’s great!
Oh, yay!|But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.
I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!|What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?|Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?|Oh yeah!

Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?|Guys are signing over their 401-K’s to me?
You work with robots!!|Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I think you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a swimmer.
You work with robots!!|Ohh, I like swimmer’s bodies!
You work with robots!!|Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.
You work with robots!!|Op, I like credit cards!
You work with robots!!|See, I’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?
You work with robots!!|Well, so what does he do?
You work with robots!!|Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.
You work with robots!!|Your company has a fine foods division?
You work with robots!!|It’s a big company, I don’t—if you—I…
You work with robots!!|Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?
No! No, the robots just work for them.|All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
No! No, the robots just work for them.|Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!
No! No, the robots just work for them.|You want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!
No! No, the robots just work for them.|Oh, what are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?
No! No, the robots just work for them.|You bet your ass, I’m gonna fire you! Thank you.
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.|Oh yeah! With who?
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?|Yeah.
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.|If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.|Hey!
Hey!|Hey, man!
Hey!|Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?
Hey!|
Hey.|Hey.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket?|They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.
You got it! Oh-oh!|What are you doing?!
It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.|Thanks.  I think you got it!
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!|Well, like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.|Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?|Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!|Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?|Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?|
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?|There’s like-there’s like 300 bucks in this one!
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?|Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?|Because we can remember them.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?|Well, sure, that too.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…|Can’t hear you!
Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!|No ma’am.
Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!|Hey! He has a name, it’s Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat.
What the hell happened?!|I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It’s been a long time since I had…  327 + 238 dollars!"
Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!|And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.
What kinda things have you been saying?|Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…|Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?
What?|I’m not Jewish, so…
So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God!|Bad dream?
So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God!|I wasn’t sleeping.
So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God!|Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebe’s song about?
So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God!|The one with the cat. I gotta go, I’ve got another date.
So, did you pick one yet?|No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.
Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!|Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.|Prague?
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?|I did! I absolutely did!
You idiot!!|I’m sure you’re right, but why?
You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!|Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.
Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!|I know! I know!
Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!|Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once.
Really?|Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
No.|Oh, it doesn’t matter.  Hey, y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.|Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.
Well that sounds fun too.|Have you ever been with a woman?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!|So there is no good time to ask that question.
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!|Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
I need more swordfish.  Can you get me some more swordfish?|I don’t speak English.
You did a minute ago!|Well, I don’t know what to tell ya!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold!|You found that handle, did ya?
That’s not funny.|Well that’s not true.
I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…|Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
You do?|You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.
Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!|What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?
You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!!  All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?|No.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?|No, it’s really good.

Oh. Oh.|So umm, you feel like taking a test? There’s only one question.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.|Okay.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.|Okay.
Great.|Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
Great.|Hey, don’t get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!
Great.|That is not true. She did! She forced me!
Great.|Hey, we would still be living here if hadn’t gotten the question wrong!
Great.|Well it stupid, unfair question!

Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?|That is one good looking man!
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!|Sooo, you’ve been doing this long?
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!|No, you’re my first. Put the money on the table.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!|Oh, yeah! Ooh, that’s nice.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!|Dude!
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!|Is that an expensive blouse?
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!|If you want it to be.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!|Here’s your girlfriend’s button.
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?|Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.|Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.
Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.|Bloomingdale’s eliminated my department.
Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.|Oh my God, are you out of a job?
Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.|No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?|Uh-huh.
That sounds great!|
That sounds great!|Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can’t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.
That sounds great!|There’s gravy?
That sounds great!|If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that’s your department now.
That sounds great!|What are you doing?
That sounds great!|I think I left a donut up here.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Ooh! How was Kathy’s play?
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.|Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.|That’s a good idea for a business!
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.|I’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they’re gonna go to their cast parties and he’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it’ll be like, "So where’s your boyfriend, what’s-his-name, Chester?" And she’ll go, "No-no-no, it’s Chandler." And he’ll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.|That-that is a good trick.
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.|All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.|Chandler, look they’re actors. They’re there to do a job, just ‘cause they work together, doesn’t mean they’re gonna get together. I mean just ‘cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen with them.
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.|Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Yeah.|Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
They’re not a couple!|Oh-okay, I get the game now.
They’re not a couple!|Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?
Oh yeah!|Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.
Oh yeah!|Really?
Oh yeah!|Look, you guys have been to every play I’ve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?
No.|Noooo!!
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?|Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Yeah, I know but…|Oh no-no-no, I’m there.
Yeah, I know but…|Hey!
Yeah, I know but…|Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
Yeah, I know but…|You made pancakes?
Yeah, I know but…|Yep! Grab a plate.
Yeah, I know but…|Okay.
Yeah, I know but…|No-no, stay right there.  Gettin’ closer.
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|Oh yeah!
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|Oh yeah, who’s playing?
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|The players.
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|Please, it’s a relief is what it is, is what it is.
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|Oh.
Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.|In a moment, please, I’m in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Hi!|Hi, I’m Joshua.
Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?|Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife…
Oh, I’m so sorry.|Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Well, at least that’s a great suit.|Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.  So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, I’m all yours.
Okay.|Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way.|It’s this way? Sorry.
I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!|All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!|Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!|Hey you guys!
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!|Hey!
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!|Hi!  Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!|Oh, absolutely!
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!|Wasn’t Nick funny when he couldn’t get his match lit?
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!|It’s a good play, isn’t it?
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.|Okay, I…
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.|Clearly, I’m having sex with him?
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!|Okay, so let me just get this straight. You’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.|Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I’m-I’m playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Well, you can understand, given how we started.|Oh, wow. I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face.
Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!|I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up!
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!|Rachel has a new doll.
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.|Uh, hello!
Hi-e!!|Ooh, what do I smell?
Hi-e!!|I don’t know, it smells good.
Hi-e!!|Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!
Hi-e!!|Ooh!
Hi-e!!|Please, have some!
Hi-e!!|Oh, yumm!
Hi-e!!|Yeah, I’ve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.
Hi-e!!|Wow! The new Playboy!
Hi-e!!|Yeah, it’s just something I picked up.
Hi-e!!|Cookies and porn, you’re the best mom ever!!
Hi-e!!|What? What?
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.|Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
It’s Joshua.|Oh, whatever.
It’s Joshua.|Wait! Wait! This isn’t take-out!
It’s Joshua.|Well, I hate to eat and run, but…
It’s Joshua.|No, wait, please don’t go! I’ve got porn for you too!
It’s Joshua.|Yeah, I don’t need it.
It’s Joshua.|People are supposed to wanna hang out here!
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?|I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?|Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?|‘Cause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But I’m-I’m done now. They’ve suffered enough.
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?|If you wanted to punish them, you should’ve just made them hang out here!
Yeah, that’s true.|All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!
Yeah, that’s true.|Oh, are we gonna trash that place?
Yeah, that’s true.|Steps!  You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!
Yeah, that’s true.|What?!
Yeah, that’s true.|So you were right?
Yeah, that’s true.|I confronted her, and she didn’t deny it!
Yeah, that’s true.|Chandler!
Chandler, what did she say?|Wait a minute.
Chandler, what did she say?|Come here.
Chandler, what did she say?|Are you sure?
Chandler, what did she say?|Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julie’s…
Beefsteak Charlie’s?|Yes! See you and I have always been like—
Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?|Nah, I got it.
Hi!|Hey!
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!|Why don’t you ask him out?
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!|Oh, yeah, totally! That’s such a turn-on!
Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?|Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.
Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?|He just got a divorce right?
Hmm-mmm.|So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.|You’ve never asked a guy out?!!
No. Have you?|Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?
I don’t even know how I would go about it.|Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin’?"
I don’t even know how I would go about it.|Oh, please!
I don’t even know how I would go about it.|Hey, how you doin’?
You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out.  You’ve done that a thousand times?|I’ve never done that.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.|Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!
Really?! You think that will work?|Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?
Really?! You think that will work?|What the heck is that?
Did she call?|No, sorry.
All right, maybe I should call her.|No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!
All right, maybe I should call her.|He’s right, what she did was unforgivable.
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?|How might you be wrong?
Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?|Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!|That’s all you’re basing this on?
That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.|Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me?|What do you think?
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!|Huh.  Yeah?
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great.  Umm, so you like it?|I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I’m gonna wear it home.
Great.|All right, thank you so much for all your help.
Sure.|Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
Yeah-eah-ha!|Thanks.  Maybe I’ll see in the spring, with the uh, y’know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!|Ah, that’s okay, thanks.
Okay.|Anyway, hopefully, I’ll see you around sometime.
Basketball!|I’m sorry.
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.|Wow! That would be great.
Really?|Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
Really?|Good morning.
Really?|Hi!
Hey.|Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Oh wow. I really wish you’d call me.|Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me— Nick’s pants?
Yeah.|Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Okay, for next time, what do you say?|I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
Okay, for next time, what do you say?|So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?
Okay, for next time, what do you say?|He didn’t turn me down! He’s at the game isn’t he? I got the date, I’m just not on it!
Okay, for next time, what do you say?|Okay, it’s ready. Come on.
What’s ready?|Just come.
What’s ready?|Oh my God!
What’s ready?|Wow! Monica!
What’s ready?|Great!
What’s ready?|This is beautiful!
What’s ready?|Oh did you—what did you—did you work for two days straight?
What’s ready?|Pretty much.  So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?
I don’t know, it looks the same.|You used to have carpet.
Oh yeah!|So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
Oh yeah!|Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?
Oh yeah!|Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. I’m always the hostess.
Oh yeah!|Hey!
How’d it go?|Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.
How’d it go?|Oh good!
How’d it go?|She is now.
How’d it go?|What are you saying?
How’d it go?|I’m saying that she… is a devil woman! Y’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I don’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.
How’d it go?|How? How is your fault?
How’d it go?|Because, I-I should’ve called! Y’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would’ve gone out with Nick, and they would’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!
How’d it go?|Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.
How’d it go?|Well, if-if she thought they were on a break…
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.|Really?
Will you call him?|Yes! I will! Absolutely!  Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?
So now, what is this now?|Guggly worm.
And this?|Glow-pop giggly jammer.
You make it so funny.|Hey umm, what’s this?
You make it so funny.|
You make it so funny.|Someone knocked over a lamp.
You make it so funny.|That’s all right. Hey you guys, you know what’s going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, I’m doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"
You make it so funny.|Great!
You make it so funny.|You don’t have to stop having fun just because I’m here. Kathy didn’t cheat on all of you.
You make it so funny.|Hey, Joey, I don’t think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean it’s only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?
You make it so funny.|Look, there’s nothing I can do for him right now, he’s still in his sweat pants, that’s still Phase One. Y'know? I’ll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.
You make it so funny.|What’s Phase Two?
You make it so funny.|Gettin’ drunk and going to a strip club.
You make it so funny.|How does going to a strip club help him better?
You make it so funny.|Because there are naked ladies there.
You make it so funny.|Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.
You make it so funny.|There are naked ladies there too.
You make it so funny.|Yeah.
You make it so funny.|Would you give me one minute!! Please.
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?|Um-hmm.  There we go. There it is.
Oh! You know what I need?|Yeah!
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.|Oh, okay. Uhh, well let’s see.
Also large?|Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Okay.|Rachel! Could I have a moment?
Okay.|Yes.
Okay.|I-I was wondering, my niece you see is in from London—well Shropshire really but y’know—well she’s about your age I say. Anyway I have tickets for the opera, Die Fledermaus, and I was wondering if you’d like to keep her company this evening?
Okay.|Sure. You got it. Great!
Okay.|Oh, good.
Okay.|Me, Fledermaus, great. I really—
Okay.|Ohh! Yes of course, thank you, thank you, thank you so very much.
So…|So?
Gloves?|Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I’ll be right back!
Uhh, actually y’know what, I kinda—I have to take off.|Oh.
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?|No! Nothing!
I invested in this night-club and it’s opening tonight, would you like to come?|Yeah! That would be great!

Why?|The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?|No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?|So you hit her in the face?
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?|No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I can’t believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.
Aww, Pheebs.|Honey, that’s you’re name.

He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.|I don’t get this! She was horrible!
He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.|Okay, I’m going to go stand over there.
Why do you care so much anyway?|I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!

Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?|Ha-ha, it’s not my baby, ha-ha-ha!
Very good,  so good.|I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
Very good,  so good.|Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didn’t call. I mean you’d think he’d be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!

That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman!  Hi. How are ya?|Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!  I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?|Hmm.
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?|OH…MY…GAWD!!
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?|Ohh, Nothing.
Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?|I know what it did! Nothing.
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?|Like this.
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?|Well, here’s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?|Sure! It flushes it.
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?|Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?|Hello!
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?|Hey!
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?|Guess who we ran into today?!
Janice?!|Isn’t this amazing?
How have you been?|Oh well, I’m divorced.
How have you been?|Ohhh, wow.

How have you been?|Bye.
How have you been?|What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
How have you been?|Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality—Well, they’re all back! Y’know? And she’s picked up like nine new ones!
How have you been?|So what are you doing bringing her here?! There’s people here!
How have you been?|Don’t worry about it. I’m taking care of it tonight.
How have you been?|You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
How have you been?|
How have you been?|Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes.  I’m tellin’ ya!
I can’t believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.|No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
I can’t believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.|Help! Help!! Help! Help!!

So how are you? I’ve been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I’ve been rather busy.|Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Oh my God. I think you’re right.|Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Oh, Liam.|Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it  football?
Oh, Liam.|We were playing rugby.
Oh, Liam.|In fact we’re playing a game at the park tomorrow. You’re welcome to play too if you want.
Ross play rugby? I don’t think so.|What’s ah, what’s so funny about that?
Well I mean, you’re American to start with. You don’t even have rugby here.|Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…
Well I mean, you’re American to start with. You don’t even have rugby here.|So good then! We’ll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!
Well I mean, you’re American to start with. You don’t even have rugby here.|Cheers!
Well I mean, you’re American to start with. You don’t even have rugby here.|Cheers!
Oh boy, I just love to sing!|Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh, look at us! Who would’ve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.|Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…
I know! And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!|Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.|I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?|No! No! Not, Paris.
Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?|Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!
When?|I don’t know exactly.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.|But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
Done?|Yep!
Done?|Hey!
Done?|Hey! What’s up?
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.|I bet I stopped listening before you did.

So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.|Y’know, you-you also could’ve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go.|It’s coming from Joey!
Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go.|Oh my God, that’s so freaky! Turn him off!!
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.|Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.|Dude, you’re not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.|Hey there Ross!
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.|Hey!
Janice.|Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.
Janice.|Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn’t really leave me much choice. Did you?
Janice.|Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
Janice.|Hey-hey, what’s going on?
Janice.|Oh, I’m packing. Y’know I’m-I’m packing ‘cause I’m moving to Yemen tomorrow.
Janice.|Thanks for telling me!
Janice.|I’m only going to pretend I’m moving to Yemen, it’s the only way I can get rid off her.
Janice.|Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
Janice.|Chandler! Come on, I’m gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It’s a real space saver.
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|Okay, Chandler, come on!
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|Joey, trade lives with me!
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|Nope.  Man look at this! Ross, I can’t believe you said you’d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|Hey, I can handle it! All right?
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|That’s ‘cause-‘cause you’re mom’s dog kept-kept looking at me.
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That’s called a scrum, okay? It’s kinda like a huddle.
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|Ross!  They’re gonna kill you!
Well, why are you doing this anyway?|Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.
You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.|Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!
You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.|I’m sorry. I’m sorry. You’re right, you are a tough guy. You’re the toughest palaeontologist I know.
You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.|All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It’s not like he’s…Chandler!
You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.|Thanks!
You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.|Look, don’t worry about me. Okay? I’ll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I’ll uh, I’ll be that guy right out of the circle.
You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.|Oh!
You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.|Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin’ at him.
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy . And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!|They don’t look any bigger than me!
Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.|I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.|All right.
Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.|Okay.
Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.|Hi.
Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.|Whoa!  I kinda liked it.
Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.|Okay, I know what I have to do. I’ve got to go Red Ross.  Y’know, Red Ross!
I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.|Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
No.|You’ll see.
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it’s his first time.|You don’t say!
Good luck, babe.|Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here!  Ross! Come on!
Good luck, babe.|Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
Good luck, babe.|JOEY!!!!!!
You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?|He asked you out?!
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.|Saucy!
What are these?|Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?|I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.|Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y’know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.
Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.|On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.
Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then.  Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.|One ticket to Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.|I’m sorry sir, I don’t understand.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?|Are you travelling with a child?
No. All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.|Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don’t take library cards.
No. All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.|What’s the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
I can’t believe they’re doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!|No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…
That’s just halftime, there’s more of this.|Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Right.|Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Okay.|Thanks.  I-I think I’m dying. I really do.
Okay.|Oh, poor baby.
Okay.|Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
Ross, they are killing you out there!|That’s not true!
Ross, they are killing you out there!|She’s right! You have to stop!
Ross, they are killing you out there!|What? No! No, I’m not stopping. I’m Red Ross!
Ross, they are killing you out there!|Dude, if you go back out there, you’re gonna be Dead Ross!
Ross, they are killing you out there!|I don’t care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.|No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.|I like that.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.|Huh?
One swift kick and he’ll back off.|All right, bad ankle, got it!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn’t wear a cup.|Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
And uh, Liam, Liam’s got bad knees. You hit him right and he’ll go down like a lamp.|But-but, Liam’s on my team.
I don’t care! You just get him!|I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
I don’t care! You just get him!|The Red Ross! Okay.
Hey!|Hi!
What-what are-what are these?|Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?
What-what are-what are these?|No-no-no, no!
What-what are-what are these?|I know that there’s no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
Oh my God! Look at this!|Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!|I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
And did you?!|No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
And did you?!|But it didn’t. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
Oh my God.|Hello darling.
Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?|Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket.
Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?|Yeah, sure.
Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?|No, not you.
Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?|Uhh, look, your eye’s still popping out a little, I’m gonna go get some ice.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|You were amazing out there.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|Oh, I kinda was, wasn’t I?
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|Oh my God!
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven’t done that since I was four and I washed my dad’s Porsche with rocks.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|You really enjoyed yourself didn’t you?
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose—I mean I-I’m not proud of it but, I really am. And it’s all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|I think you’ve got concussion.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|No, no, I’m serious. Thank you.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|You’re welcome.  I’m sorry. Did I hurt you?
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|It’s worth the pain.  Y’know what, you know what? It’s not.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.|Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.|Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I’ll wait for you. Do you even know how long you’re going to be gone?
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.|Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.|Oh. Well, I’ll right you everyday.  15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.|Chandler!
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.|Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.|No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.|Well, I then guess I’m going to Yemen! I’m going to Yemen!  When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.|Thank God.
What is it hon?|I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake!  No.
Aww, honey I’m sorry.|God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Aww, honey I’m sorry.|Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
Yeah?|It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.|No!
Oh! Wait-wait!  Is it my bologna sandwich?|Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!
What are you writing?|Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Hi guys!|Hey!
Hi guys!|Hey, what have you guys been up too?
Hi guys!|Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
Without me?!|My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
Without me?!|Yeah.
Without me?!|They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
Without me?!|I don’t know how museums work in England but, here, you’re not supposed to take stuff.
Without me?!|I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.
Without me?!|Bye.
Without me?!|Right, I’ve got to be off, I’ll see ya. Buh-bye then.
Without me?!|Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
Without me?!|Oh yeah, she’s-she’s amazing. And-and she’s so much fun. And! Y’know what? When I’m with her, I’m fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes.  She’s leaving in two days, I don’t have to do it.
Without me?!|Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
Without me?!|Yeah, she’s got to go back to London. But you know what? I’ve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that’s it. Y’know.
Without me?!|Hey that’s what all my relationships are like.
Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.|Pheebs!
Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.|Hey!
Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.|Hello! Hello!
Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.|Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y’know? And I got nauseous.
Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!|Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!|Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!|That’s sweat. You throw up all morning, you’ll have that glow too.
Okay!|Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.
Oh great!  Wow! Yeah, it’s comfortable.|Yeah?
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.|Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Why not?!|Well, that’s because of a lot of…
Y’know, they ruin it for everybody.|I know!
Y’know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.|Oh?
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.|Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
No, no, no, she’s nice but, y’know, it just it made me realize that I’m just not, I’m just not ready to be dating, y’know?|Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting.
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?|Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.
Then uh, what’s-what’s this?|You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.|What are you talking about?
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.|Yeah, what’ going on?
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua.|Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua.|Awwww!
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua.|Hello?
Surprise!!!|Surprise!!
Surprise!!!|No one’s ever thrown me a surprise party before!
Well, it was all Ross’s idea.|You’re so sweet! And I’m so surprised!
Well, it was all Ross’s idea.|You really didn’t know?
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?|Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.
Like what?|What-what-what is so funny?
I said, "Like what?"|Now that’s a thinker.

I said, "Like what?"|Hi!
I said, "Like what?"|Care for a cherry?
I said, "Like what?"|Oh, no thanks.
I said, "Like what?"|No? Y’know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
I said, "Like what?"|You okay?
I said, "Like what?"|So we should probably get going soon.
I said, "Like what?"|Oh, but the party’s only just getting started!
I said, "Like what?"|Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y’know, then The Plaza for dinner.
I said, "Like what?"|So why did you plan a party at the same time?
I said, "Like what?"|No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It’s usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I’m so surprised—good-bye!"
I said, "Like what?"|But Ross, I’m such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.

Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.|No! You guys can’t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.|What big thing?
All right. Who wants to go first?|I’ll go.
All right. Who wants to go first?|Yay!

Yay! Emily!|What are the odds? What are the odds?
Yay! Emily!|Okay, that-that’s enough! Y’know, let’s, let’s let someone else play.
Yay! Emily!|If you didn’t want to play, why did you come to the party?
Okay, my turn!!|Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
Okay, my turn!!|Ohh!
It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!|Oh my God!
Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.|Okay.
Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.|There’s a Phoebe on my sandwich!
Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.|Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.|All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?
Yeah, totally!|All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong,  do it right!
Feel better now?|Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.|What?
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?|Yeah.
Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.|Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|But, we can’t go now. It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a skit.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn’t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can’t let—, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|Hey!

Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|I think you’re done.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|Okay, time to take off the bra.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|Take the bra off.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|All right, come on, let’s go get your coat.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|Okay.
So, this was uh, really fun.|Oh, yeah! Real fun.
Need uh, need a little hand there.|Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
You really don’t seem like you do. That’s…|Ughhhh!! Forget it!  This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Well, what was supposed to happen?|Can you not look at me when I say this?  I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Huh. Oh, boy!  Uhh, I-I don’t wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.|Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.|Why?!
Because I-I like you.|You like me?
Yeah! I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and sophisticated—a lot of this isn’t based on tonight.|Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
But…|Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Okay uh, however…|Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.
My marriage like just ended, and I’m really not ready to get into anything yet.|But….
I’m sorry, I, I just need a little time.|Okay.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.|That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…
Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.|Yeah.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.|Helps a little.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?|Yeah, have a seat.
I’m so sorry.|That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?
Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?|What do you mean?
You seem to really like her.|Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.|You think?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.|Hey, you’re right.
Yeah.|Thanks.  What photo album was it?
I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.|Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Hey.|Hey.
You’re a pathetic loser, right?|Oh-ho, yeah!
Sit!|Hi.
Oh my gosh, Joshua!|All those things I said about not being ready…
They’re not true?|No, they’re-they’re all true.
Oh.|But…
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?|Yeah.
Oooh, what you got there?|Pastrami.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?|Hm-mm, corn beef.
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?|Okay.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?|Six months.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?|Not if I get there first.
Ohhh, man!!|What is that?
Ohhh, man!!|Treeger’s snaking the shower drain.
What in the name of hell?|Maybe he found you flip-flop.
What in the name of hell?|Hey!
What in the name of hell?|Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must’ve hit something on the remote.
What in the name of hell?|Do we pay for this?
What in the name of hell?|No, we didn’t even pay our cable bill—maybe this is how they punish us.
What in the name of hell?|Maybe we shouldn’t pay our phone bill—free phone sex.
What in the name of hell?|Maybe we shouldn’t pay our gas bill?
Whoa, hey, that lady’s all kinds of naked.|Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.|Like finding money with naked people on it!
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I’m sad.|
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|Oh no-no-no-no!
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|We don’t know what could make this go away.
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|And no one touches the air around the TV!
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|Well at least, I’m going to mute it.
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|Oh no-no-no!
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|We still have porn.
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|Hey.
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|Hi!
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|Hi!
Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy.|Yeah.
Give it here.|Okay.
Give it here.|Ohh, I’m getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y’know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
Give it here.|Or a job where you don’t have to carry a table.
Give it here.|You mean like a doctor?
Give it here.|Pheebs! You’re blocking the porn! Look out!
Give it here.|Ohh!  Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
Hi.|Hi.
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.|Oh. Why didn’t you take her?
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…|You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Nah.|Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?
Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said,  "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…"|No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.
And why do you care so much?|Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
You had fantasies about Emily?|No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?|Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ahh.|Do you love her?
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?|You love her!
What-what is love really?|Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she’s gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
I am a good kisser.|Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn.
Is that the heartbeat?|That’s it.
Is that the heartbeat?|Oh my God!
Oh wow! This is so cool.|Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Oh wow! This is so cool.|Why don’t take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I’ll hold onto your card, okay?
Oh wow! This is so cool.|No, I’m getting three separate heartbeats.
Oh wow! This is so cool.|Three? You guys were worried I wouldn’t even have one!
Oh wow! This is so cool.|Doctors are wrong all the time.
Oh wow! This is so cool.|Well, yeah.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!|Definitely.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!|Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I’m going to have three full grown babies just walkin’ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it’s gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!|Actually, giving birth to three babies isn’t that different from giving birth to one.
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!|What do you know?!
Oh-oh, Phoebe!|Ooh! Hi!
Hi!  So, how did it go at the doctors?|Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that’s nice?"
Hi!  So, how did it go at the doctors?|Yes.
Hi!  So, how did it go at the doctors?|Okay, yeah well, good news, you’re going to have three babies.
Three babies?|I finally got my band!
We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family!|Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family!|Why would we be freaked?
We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family!|No, no maybe ‘cause it’s harder to raise them, and the added expense, and…
We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family!|Oh.
Right.|No, back to happy. Back to happy!
No-no-no, no, it’s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y’know it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop.|Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
No, Frank.|No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?
No, Frank.|Yeah, refrigerator college.
Yeah.|Yeah, y’know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y’know I figured y’know like I should y’know have like a career—and I love refrigerators!
Yeah.|You can’t give up on your dream.
Yeah.|No, it’s okay. We’re-we’re gonna have three kids! And that’s-that’s a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.

Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?|Ooh, good, you’re hear! Okay.
Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?|Hey!

Hello?|Ross.
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?|It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.|Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you, there’s-there’s someone else.
She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.|This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy.
Well…|Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!|You put your fist through the wall?
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!|You have to go to London!
What?|Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
What?|Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. ‘Cause you already told her you love her and she didn’t say it back, then she called you and told you that there’s another guy, so yeah, go to London that’ll scare her!
What?|When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
I made fun of his accent.|You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
No.|All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily!  That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Really?|Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!
All right. All right, I’m gonna do it!|All right.
I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.|Okay, good luck!
I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.|Ross! Ross! If you’re going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
Hey!|Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!
Hey!|That’s sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…|I’m telling it! I’m telling it!
Okay.|Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got?
Okay.|A place where no one will ever get out alive?
Okay.|No! Think about it, it’s a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it’s…
Relaxi-Taxi!|The name was my favourite part!
Well, well I can up with it!|YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.
Well, I…|Hello.
Well, I…|Hey.
Well, I…|Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!|All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
About four hours.|Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home.
About four hours.|Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that’s better than Relaxi Cab.
About four hours.|Okay, it’s not Relaxi Cab. It’s Relaxicab, like taxicab.
About four hours.|Oh, that is better.
Are we in London?|What are you doing here? You can’t be here!
Are we in London?|I’ve uh, I’ve come to talk to Ross.
Are we in London?|What?
Are we in London?|Nothing. No, nothing.
Are we in London?|I was going to call him, but…
Are we in London?|Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it!  I’m right, right?
Are we in London?|I’d really rather talk to him.
Are we in London?|Oh.
Are we in London?|I uh, I’ve been to his apartment and he wasn’t there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don’t know if you can hear this but…  I’m gonna talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends and it’s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you—Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.|
I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that. I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well.  Hello.|Hi.
Ross, I love you!|Ohh! Thank you.
Hey.|Hey.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.|Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!

Hey!|Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!|All right.
Listen. Listen.  Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?|Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!|Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Hey! What are you doing here?|Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.|Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.|Wouldn’t that be Frank the III?
Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.|Don’t get me started.  Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.
Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.|You think about it.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised?|Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Ohh, it’s time to go.|Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Well that’s ambitious.|Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
That’s Carol with your son!|Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand.
That’s Carol with your son!|Ross!
That’s Carol with your son!|I’ll be right there.  Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.
That’s Carol with your son!|Hey, it’s so nice to finally meet you!
Me too!|Ohh, y’know, Susan’s gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Me too!|Oh yeah, I’m so excited, I’ve never been there.
Oh, well, I’ll show you around.|That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions…
Oh, there’s tonnes of terrific stuff—I’ll go with you!|Ahh!
Oh, there’s tonnes of terrific stuff—I’ll go with you!|Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport so…
Are you all right?|Oh, he’s fine. He’s fine. It’s just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn’t like me.
Are you all right?|Oh come on! That’s-that’s… true.
Hi!|Hey!
Hi!|Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book  and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon.|Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book  and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon.|Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?
No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."|Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they’re hanging out with Joey."
No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."|Hey, y’know what, if you’re gonna do that, if you’re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.  Oh, come on! Chandler’s funny, sophisticated, and he’s very loveable, once you get to know him.
No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."|Oh well, hey, Joey’s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he’ll be there.
No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."|Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he’ll be there. And he’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you’re really hot.
No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."|What do ya say? What do ya say?
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.  But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.|I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.|Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.
Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.|Um-hmm.
What am I making him by the way?|Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?|Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey!
So uh, Emily called last night…|And now you’re giving me the message!
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!|God, Susan is so fun!
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."|You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?|No, but I’m gonna!
Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?|Hi! Hi! You’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!|Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.
What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.|No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?|Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|Raymond Chandler.
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|Someone you didn’t make up!
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|Okay, there are no famous Joey’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|Yeah, that guy really hurt us.
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if it’s like y’know, Chanoey?
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, he’ll never be President. There’s never gonna be a President Joey.
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|All right look man, I didn’t want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! It’s not even a name; it’s barely even a word. Okay? It’s kinda like chandelier, but it’s not! All right? It’s a stupid, stupid non-name!
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|Wow, you’re, you’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name.
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|I’m sorry man, I didn’t—I’m-I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|Okay.
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|So I guess it’s Joey then!
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.|Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me.  Ahh. So, dig in!
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!|Hmmm!
Oh my God!|Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.
Behind you?|Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!|Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!|
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?|Yeah, it’s-it’s my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would’ve told you about it, but I didn’t know they would be here.
Oh.|So, all right.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What?|Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still out there.
But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.|Okay, that’s-that’s not funny. Uhh.
Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.|Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess. But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there.
Your parents’?|Yeah, they’re out of town.
Ohh.|Yeah-yeah, it’s this huge place, and-and it’s got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Yeah that works.|They-they-they can smell fear.
Hey!|Hey! How’s Ben?
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he’s sweeping.|Hey, Ben! Hey!
So umm, any word from Susan?|Ooh, yeah! She said she’s having sooo much fun with Emily.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?|What’s too much fun?
Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.|Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Am I?!|Yes!
Am I?!|I can’t speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?|Maybe.
…and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!|Wow! This place is fabulous!
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.|Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.
Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.|Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?|That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your left.|Ah.
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your left.|Oh, hi, darling!
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?|Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?|France sucks!
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.|Oh, say no more!
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.|We’ll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and we’ll be right out of you hair.
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn’t even get to Italy?|Yep, sucks!
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn’t even get to Italy?|Hi you!
Oh my God!|I know, I can do more than cook.
Oh my God!|I like her. She sees smart.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents…|Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you.  Hello.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents…|Hi.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents…|Hello.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents…|Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents…|What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not—that’s-that’s not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. It’s-it’s, they’re-they’re wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdale’s, so… And obviously in uh, in-in this case,  I am going to report back, "USA not ready."
Uhh, Rachel, my parents…|Maybe in L.A?
Uhh, Rachel, my parents…|Yes!
There you go.|So, have you kids eaten yet?
There you go.|Well, we were going to do that after—I mean umm, next.
There you go.|Well, we’re starving, why don’t we all go get something to eat?
There you go.|Oh, yeah, well… Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyin’ around the house.
There you go.|So… We go eat.
There you go.|Yes.
There you go.|You’ll wear that. We’ll be eating, and of course, you’ll be wearing that.
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!|No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!
It’s not that bad.|Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
So, you’re just Bing?|I have no name.
So, you’re just Bing?|All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?
So, you’re just Bing?|Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.|Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.|Umm, Gene.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.|It’s Clint. It’s Clint!
See you later, Gene.|Bye, Gene.
See you later, Gene.|It’s Clint! Clint!
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?|Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?|Oh my God!
Oh, no!|No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs.
Oh, no!|So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!
Oh, no!|So?
Oh, no!|So! Poetry? Susan’s gay! They’re being gay together!
Emily’s straight.|Oh, wake up!
Emily’s straight.|Wow, Carol really messed you up!
Emily’s straight.|Excuse me?
Emily’s straight.|Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant.  All right, so I don’t know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.
Emily’s straight.|Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.
Emily’s straight.|Huh.
Emily’s straight.|What?
Emily’s straight.|She’s totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.
This totally makes sense!|It does not!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!|All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!|Absolutely! Absolutely!
This is so much fun!|This is not fun!
Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.|Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.
Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.|Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.
Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.|What—yeah—what, y’know what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.
Drum roll.|Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
Drum roll.|Nah, you’re not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.
Drum roll.|All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.
You’re actually going through with this?|Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.|Really?!
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!|Okay. Thanks.
Okay!|You wanna hug it out?
Yay!|Yay!
Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!|Okay!
Ooh, uh…|Bye, Pheebs!
Okay, bye!|Ha! Ha! Ha!
Okay, bye!|Ohh!
Nice luggage.|I was gonna say…
Nice luggage.|Hey!
Hi!|Hey! I missed you.
Oh, I missed you too.|Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Oh, I missed you too.|Oh, so did I.

Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|Are you kidding? I love that guy!  Morning’s here! Morning is here—
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|Monica, you don’t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|Y’know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|Okay.
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|See, this is a great apartment.
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|Shut up! This place is a hole!
Oh, blimey, I still can’t believe you’ve got an earring!|Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
He does that?!|Uh, I don’t know, whatever.
I think it makes you look really dangerous.|Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
I love both of you!|Yeah?
I wish I didn’t have to go.|Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day.
Ohh, Ross, please!|One more day, seriously/
Don’t do this to me, again. You’d know I’d stay here in a minute, but I’d really miss so much work, they’ll fire me.|So, then you can stay as long as you want.
I wish I could.|Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on!
I don’t think you understand packing. Look, I just don’t want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.|Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
You didn’t!|No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.
Hello!|Ho! Ho! Ho!
Excuse me.|Your pants!
Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!|Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
What?|Santa pants.  Santa Claus’s pants.
Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names.  Ohh.|Hey!
Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names.  Ohh.|Hey!
Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names.  Ohh.|So—Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?

I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.|Yeah, my mom got my dad’s season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.
I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.|Yeah, apparently, they’re pretty good seats.
I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.|Yeah.
I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.|Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!
I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.|Do you guys want these?
I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.|Yeah!

Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|Are you serious?
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|Yeah, what, do you think we’re stupid?
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|You’re not stupid. You’re meaner than I thought.
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|What do you say?
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|You’re bachelor pad?!
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|Have you even had a girl up here?
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|Yeah, you do!
Come on!|Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Come on!|Good one.
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?|Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.
Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!|
Hey!|Oh my God!
We don’t make enough fun of you already?|Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
We don’t make enough fun of you already?|You do know that Wham broke up?
We don’t make enough fun of you already?|I like it, and Emily likes it, and that’s what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.|Where is Emily?
Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.|Ugh, she’s saying good-bye to her uncle.
Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.|Man, didn’t she like just get here?
Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.|Yeah!! Yeah!
Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.|Easy tiger.
Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.|I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it’s-it’s so great. But at the same time I’m thinking, "Well, I’m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.|So what are you going to do?
Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.|Nothing! There’s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she’d have to uh, move here. She should move here!
What?|I could ask her to live with me!
What?|Are you serious?
What?|I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
What?|Because you’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge I’ve had a longer relationship with!
What?|Look guys, when I’m with her it’s-it’s-it’s like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y’know?
What?|And I love the milk! But, I’m not gonna some British girl to move in with me!  Joey, you say things now.
All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!|I don’t want to do that.
No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!|Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!|Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
That’s too hard. Too hard!|All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
That’s too hard. Too hard!|Or I’ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
That’s too hard. Too hard!|No thank you.
That’s too hard. Too hard!|Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Come on! Come on, let’s trade! The timing’s perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
That’s too hard. Too hard!|Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can’t leave in the small apartment after we’ve lived here! Didn’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
That’s too hard. Too hard!|Yes! Didn’t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn’t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
That’s too hard. Too hard!|Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
That’s too hard. Too hard!|It’s the Knicks!
That’s too hard. Too hard!|Screw the Knicks!
That’s too hard. Too hard!|Whoa!
That’s too hard. Too hard!|I didn’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
That’s too hard. Too hard!|Huh.
That’s too hard. Too hard!|And the Knicks rule all.
That’s too hard. Too hard!|Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?|No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?|All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?|Done!
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?|Let me finish.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?|Oh.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?|I’m talking about a bet, winner takes all.
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?|Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
Or you could end up with everything.|Ooh, I like that.
Or you could end up with everything.|All right, so what do you say?
Or you could end up with everything.|No!
Or you could end up with everything.|Oh, just do it!!
Or you could end up with everything.|Op, op, I’m convinced!
Or you could end up with everything.|Come on man, you know I’d do it for you! Because, you’re my best friend.
Or you could end up with everything.|All right, but you can’t use that again for a whole year. I’m in.
Or you could end up with everything.|All right!
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?|Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!|Okay!
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!|Okay!
This is great!|What’s the game?! What’s the game?!

I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha!|No they didn’t!
Hey!|I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
Move in with me.|What?!
Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.|Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
I know.|My job!
Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!|Yeah, but it-it-it’s my whole life—you come to England.
No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?|Ohh, I don’t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future –and-and-and we were getting married or something.
What?|Oh no, no, right I shouldn’t have said married. Uh, please don’t go freaky on me. I didn’t mean it. Well, I didn’t say it; I take it back!
No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?|Why don’t we what?
Get married.|You are mad!
No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.|We’ve only known each other for six weeks!
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?|My parents are going to be really mad.
Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?|Yes.
Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?|Yes!
Yes! We’re getting married?!|Oh my God!
Yes!|We’re getting married!
Come here, come here. Uh,  ow! Emily, will you marry me?|Yes.
Come here, come here. Uh,  ow! Emily, will you marry me?|Ohh, it’s a bit small.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!|It was.
Those were like the best seats ever.|Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda like a peace offering.
Oh. Oh, God!|Hey, want a beer?  WHOA!!!!
Open up! Open up! Open up!|We’ll discuss it, in the morning!
What the hell is going on?!|We took our apartment back!!
What the hell is going on?!|Okay, it was my idea, but I don’t feel good about it.
We are switching back, right now!|No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!
Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?|I don’t know.
What?|I don’t want to move again!
I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!|All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!|Let us keep the apartment and…
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!|As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
Totally worth it!|That was one good minute!
Good night.|Good night.
Men are such idiots.|Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Men are such idiots.|That’s so funny to think if you’d just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.|Yeah.
Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.|Okay, scarf’s done.
Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.|Come on! Come on. Come on.
Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.|Okay!
Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.|Hey!
Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.|Hey!
What-what’s going on?|Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
What-what’s going on?|Uhh, okay, it’s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.
What-what’s going on?|What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
What-what’s going on?|Umm, no.
When, when did—how, how did you…|We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
When, when did—how, how did you…|I mean, we know it’s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so…
When, when did—how, how did you…|Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys…
When, when did—how, how did you…|Yeah, I-I heard.  Ohh, I’m so happy for you!
When, when did—how, how did you…|Oh, well, that’s great!
When, when did—how, how did you…|Yeah! Yeah!
I can’t believe you’re getting married!|Yeah.
I can’t believe you’re getting married!|Monica and Rachel made out.
Morning’s here! The morning’s here!|Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning’s here!
Hey! You’re back!|Hey!  Get into gear!

Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please?  So uh, what do you do when you’re not working here?|You don’t need to fill these silences.
Oh, okay, thanks.|Chandler, that’s like your fourth cup of coffee!
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!|He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud?
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!|Oh, you should here me.
It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!|Look, I told ya, I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a problem, you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
They don’t have those.|Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve just had your first class!
They don’t have those.|Y’know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over…
They don’t have those.|Ohhh, yeah!
They don’t have those.|He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over!|I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over!|Hey guys!
Hey, all right!|Hey!
Hey, all right!|Oh, the Olympics.
Hey, all right!|Have you guys picked a date yet?
Hey, all right!|Oh no, not yet.
Hey, all right!|I still cannot believe you’re engaged!  Just ‘cause its happening so fast; not ‘cause you’re such a loser.
Hey, all right!|Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?
Hey, all right!|Ugh, she’s upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! I’m not doing them this time! I don’t care if those dishes sit in the sink until they’re all covered with—I’ll do them when I get home!
Hey, all right!|Yeah—oh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in London…
Hey, all right!|Already?!
Hey, all right!|Yeah, but it didn’t fit. Well, luckily there’s a store here that has one left in her size, but I’m the groom, I’m not supposed to see the dress…
Hey, all right!|I’ll pick it up for you!
Hey, all right!|Thank you.
Hey, all right!|Okay.
Oh, she’s got you running errands, y’know, picking up wedding dresses…  Wah-pah!|What’s wah-pah?
Y’know, whipped! Wah-pah!|That’s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
That’s what I did. Wah-pah!|You can’t do anything!
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!|Hey!
Oh! It’s you.  Hi.|Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so…|So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Oh.|I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda….. y’know.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I’m okay.|Yeah?
Yeah.|All right, I just wanted to check.
Oh, that’s sweet.|You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Uhh, hang in there?|Oh, no, I didn’t mean, uh…
I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?|Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t realise that had become anything, yet.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.|Oh. Yeah?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically…|Wow, that’s-that’s-that’s incredible.
I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.|Uh-huh.
You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.|I gotta get to work.
Oh yeah? Fine.|Hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy?
Oh yeah, no, what’s that?|If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
That would be great!|Yeah, all right, it’s a date.
|Did you say something?
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!|Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!|May I help you ladies?
Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.|Yes, what’s the name, please?
Emily Waltham.|Yes! I have it right here.  Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.|I am, aren’t I?
You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.|Ms. Waltham?
You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.|Yes?
You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.|We’re closing.
You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.|All right.
You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.|And could I get my ring back?
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming.  Uh, just a second!|No-no, let me in!
Phoebe?|Yeah!
Can you just hold on for one minute?|No, you have to let me in right now!!
Are you alone?|Yes!
This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!|It’s 6:00.
Yeah, well…|Hi!
Yeah, well…|Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that’s, I think that’s really cool.
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|What?
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it’s ridiculous! I mean, they’re gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they’ve done and they’re call the whole thing off. I’m telling ya, you’re gonna be dancing at my wedding before you’re dancing at there’s.
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Yeah, well, I don’t dance at weddings.
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Why not?
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Because weddings are a great place to meet women, and when I dance, I look like this…
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Hey man.
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Hey!
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Nothing.
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Nothing.
I am…  free!|Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
I am…  free!|What?!
I am…  free!|Yep!
I am…  free!|In a month?
I am…  free!|Yeah!

I am…  free!|Yeah.
I am…  free!|From now?
I am…  free!|Yeah.
I am…  free!|Well, that’s great.
I am…  free!|Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it’s going to be torn down, so… I mean, I-I know it’s crazy, but everything up ‘til now has been so crazy, and I don’t know, this just feels right. Y’know?
Hey, Rachel.|Hi!
What’s up? You’re voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.|Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you.  See you.
Great!|Yeah!  Sit!
You okay?|I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Do I?|‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y’know?
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re clicking.|Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I’m not too sure I agree with that.|Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ……I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
What?!|Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you’re a real special lady, but my divorce isn’t final yet and, and, and we’ve been on four days, so I’m thinking "No, but thanks."|YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Your name, please?|Joey Tribbiani.
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study.|Yes he did.

Okay, ready?|Yeah.
Okay.|
Congratulations!|Thank you!
Okay! My turn! My turn!|Okay!  Okay, ready?
Yeah.|Okay.
That was a terrible throw!!|I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!
Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?!  Oh my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?|Yeah, I think we are.
This isn’t even my dress.|Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, "It’s Not Too Late."
I’m changing out of this.|Me too.
In like a half-hour?|Me too.
Okay, throw it straight this time.|Okay.
I’m getting married next!!|Yay!
I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.|Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly?
Oh my God!|Oh God.
Oh, you’re such a cheater!|Hello! Little ones.
Oh, you’re such a cheater!|Hey!
Hey!|So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Hey!|Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.  Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
Oh, how’d that happen?|Because I’m cooler.
Oh, how’d that happen?|No, seriously.
Oh, how’d that happen?|Well she’s, she’s the kinda girl—Joey was unconscious.
Oh, how’d that happen?|Hey you guys! What’s happening?
Oh, how’d that happen?|Oh my God!
What is that?|Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna help me not to snore.
What is that?|Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? ‘Cause I don’t think you have to wear it unless you are!
What is that?|
What is that?|Plus, you look cool.
Well, I just called Joshua…|Oh, how did it go?
Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.|What did he say?
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.|Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.
Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.|Yeah, maybe.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.|Any luck?
Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.|Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.
Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.|Hey!
Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.|Hey!
Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.|So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie’s at 9 o’clock?
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.|Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.
Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.|What happened?
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.|Noo. Why?
Well, apparently he scares easy.|Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.
It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.|Come here.
Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?|Yeah.
Yeah.|You okay?
Ugh.|Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?
Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.|Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.  Maybe someday, there will be.
Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.|Oh God! He’s gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
Oh, okay!|No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!
Oh, okay!|No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
I’m not gonna marry Chandler!|Not after this!
Okay, you guys, just relax.|I gotta go.
Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.|I know. Ross is getting married.
Phoebe is, making people.|Everybody’s doing stuff!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!|We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.|No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!|Yeah!
We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!|Hey!

Yeah baby!|Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die!
Yeah, well…|We could get that Everest video though.
Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!|And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard!  Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Oh, well…|So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?
Yeeeeahhhh.|Yeah. Yeah.
But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!|Yeah we are!
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?|Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Yeah, they’re fine.|Yeah?
If anyone asks, we’ll just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?|Sure. Why not?
Really?|Yeah?
I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.|Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?
Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it’s absolutely your decision.  More tea?|Yeah sure.

You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.|I did.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?|Yeah, maybe...
See, I see.... big passion in your future.|Really?
I do.|Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.|Okay.
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....|Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]
Yes, yes, that's right...|Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross] Look at it!
Yes! Did you see that?|You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
I could not have done this without you.|Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.|What?
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.|Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.|Fine.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.|Good.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...|No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.

It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”  Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...|WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
You seem to really like her.|Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.|You think?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.|Hey, you’re right.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic!|Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."

You don’t have a car. And your license expired.|I know.  Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!  "It’s almost as good as being there."|It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.|I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.|Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.|Michael Curtis
That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve been here!|That’s also like the tenth time you told us.

Hi, guys.|Hi! Phoebe.
Hi, guys.|Hi Phoebe.
I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.|No we…
I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.|Hormones.
I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.|…hormones, yeah.
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.|Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how are things going?
Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?|Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.
Oh!|It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.|Well, h-how is this like that?
Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…|I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…
Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?|Hey guys!
Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?|Hey!
Hey…|I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!|Yeah, right!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…|That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…|So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…|Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…|So you might say, it’s a magic ring.
Yeah, the stripper stole it.|My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Yeah, the stripper stole it.|Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why don’t you be my best man."
Yeah, the stripper stole it.|All right-all right, fine! I-I’m gonna call the cops!
Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!|Not on you! On the stripper!
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.|Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!
I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they’d call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!"|So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…|Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Here’s your tea Phoebe.|Oh, thanks.
Here’s your tea Phoebe.|Good.
I’m so glad you liked it.|
What?!|What?! She made the tea!
What?!|Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.
What?!|You what?
Oh my God!|Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!|Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what? It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!|No. It’s all right; it’s probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.
Rachel, get the book! The book!|Okay!  Okay! Here!
The Bible?!|I don’t know!

There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!|Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!|Yeah!
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!|We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!|Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I don’t need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!|Marry me.
I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.|Well, do you see any babies?
I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.|How do you feel?
I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.|Okay, I guess. I mean… I don’t know, it’s just, I guess I know it’s going to be over soon.
Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.|I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.|Some moms do that.
Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.|Okay that’s even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, it’s just that now that they’re in me it’s like, it’s like I know them y’know, I mean-I mean, it’s just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.|Aww, sweetie, but it’s not like you’re not gonna have anything. You’re gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that’s even better.
Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.|Yeah, okay.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?|I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!|Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!|Yeah.
And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.|They are gonna love me.
Oh!|Thanks you guys! Again.

Oh!|You’re the best. Thanks. Oh!
Oh!|What?!
Oh!|Just kidding. Ahh!

If anything should happen to him…|Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.
So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make it?!|He will, Joe.
I’m so worried about him, y’know?|Somebody lose a ring?
I’m so worried about him, y’know?|Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much!
H-h-h-how’s the duck?|He’s doing just fine, he’s resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.|No, that’s all right.
No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!|Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know what, Ross you were right from the start, he  should be your best man.|No, you should.
Now, don’t argue with me…|Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Now, don’t argue with me…|Really?
Really?|Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good…
Really?|Thanks man.

|Total wuss!
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!|Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.
Passport, check!  Camera, check! Traveller’s cheques, check!|Who are you saying "check" too?
Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check!  My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.|Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check!  My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.|Hey!

Yeah, okay, give that a try!|What?!
Yeah, okay, give that a try!|To London! Come to London. Please? It’ll mean so much to me.
Yeah, okay, give that a try!|Yeah, well, I gotta work, I’m sorry.
Yeah, okay, give that a try!|Why-why can’t you take a couple of days off?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!|Because, I can’t! Ross, I told you, no. I can’t.
Yeah, okay, give that a try!|This is my wedding.
All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!|Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.
All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!|Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!|Thank you.

All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!|London baby!!
All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!|Oh, do you need a hug? You don’t have to bring me anything!
Come on! Do something!|I am, I’m ignoring you.
Okay, here!|Oh, what the hell is that?
It’s London, baby! All right, the hotel’s here.|Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
I got it!  Here we go.|Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
…and that was all before 10 o’clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We’re not gonna be…|Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
Well, up yours too!|What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!
Sorry.|Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
Sorry.|Chicken Kiev?
Sorry.|Um-hmm! Doesn’t that sound delicious at the last minute?
Sorry.|Yeah, y’know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn’t have to worry about the salmonella.  So, I can’t wait to see this place you’re getting married!
Sorry.|Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily’s parents got married here.
I still can’t believe they’re tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you’ll ever see. I mean it’s over…  Oh my God!|It’s nice.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?|It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.
How’s it gonna be all right?!|Uh-huh, I see that.
How’s it gonna be all right?!|Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
How’s it gonna be all right?!|What? What?
How’s it gonna be all right?!|They torn it down a few days early.
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen. Hey!  Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?|I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.
Really? To what?|To Put the Camera Away!!!
Oh. Oh.|Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?
Oh, no. Oh, nothing.|Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Okay, I have a wedgie.|Okay, that is all you.
So-so, what do you want for lunch?|Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.
Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?|I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…|Still in love with?!
Yeah!|I’m not in love with Ross!
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.|Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!
We thought you knew!|We?!
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!|You all know? Does Ross know?
Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.|Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!
Hey!|So, what are you guys in the market for? We’ve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?|Well, I don’t have to buy that, "I’m with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it. Here you go.|All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Oh, I embarrass you?|How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?
Oh, I embarrass you?|He’s just jealous. You’ll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
Oh, I embarrass you?|Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
Oh, I embarrass you?|They’re all tourists.
Oh, I embarrass you?|All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y’know, you’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.|Good choice.
Thanks.|Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Hello?|Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
We don’t have to.|Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.|She said what?
She said, "If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."|Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isn’t right.
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.|I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Don’t you point your pants at me!  We have no choice! Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Ross don’t you understand? This is our wedding I’m talking about.|The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.
So what are you saying? It’s now or never?|No. I’m saying it’s now.
Or?|There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
It’s not the pants. It’s you that is backwards. And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all!|
Hey!|Hi.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?|Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well, I think I can help you get over him.|You can?
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.|Um-hmm.
And a small piece of chocolate.|Okay.
And a glass of tepid water.|Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.|I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here.  Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?|I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.|Okay.
Okay?|All right.
So uh, now look at the picture…|Okay.
All right, and umm…|Ow!
Okay, how do you feel now?|Well, I like you less!
Hey.|Hey.
Oh.  Sorry!|No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.
Me too.|Yeah?
Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!|Hey!
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.|Okay, so umm, what’s your friend’s name?
Oh, Chandler.|Hi Chandler!
Oh, Chandler.|That’s… That’s was…
Oh, Chandler.|Oh my God!
That’s Fergie baby!!|Joey says you don’t really like his hat, but I think it’s kinda dashing.
That’s Fergie baby!!|How did you? How? How?
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey!|Hey!
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey!|Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey!|Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey!|Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey!|Umm…
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey!|I’m gonna go to the bathroom.
Wait up!|Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?
Wait up!|She said that?!
Wait up!|Yeah.
Wait up!|Why?!
Wait up!|I don’t know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
Wait up!|Oh my God. You’re even dumber than I am!
Wait up!|Excuse me?
Wait up!|Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
Wait up!|I don’t know. A month?
Wait up!|Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That’s what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake  Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
Wait up!|I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
Wait up!|Sometimes we were.
Wait up!|Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
Wait up!|Okay.
Wait up!|Come on.
Wait up!|That was pretty intense huh?
Yeah.  Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!|I hope he did!
Hello.|Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.|That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?|Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.
So you’re not homesick yet?|No, I don’t think so.
All right, the seven of us miss you.|Who’s seven?
Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…|Ahh, the babies miss me?
Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!|What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the Joey Special.|Two pizzas?!
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.|Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!|You’ll see.
Oh God.|Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…
Oh God.|And the musicians, look, they can go over here  You go.
Oh God.|But-but, if you don’t love this, we’ll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it’s fine, whatever you want.
It’s perfect.|And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…
Well then we’ll get wet.|Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.
Pheebs?|Yeah?
Do you remember where the duck food is?|Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?
Because I’m going to London.|What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back.|I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.|That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Ohh—Do you think he will?!|No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know, it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.
Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, "I do."|I do! I do! I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter.
The Waltham Residence.|Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.|This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it’s not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.|No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me the number for where they are?
I’m afraid, I’m not at liberty to divulge that information.|Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Hangs up.|Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Hey.|Hi. Mom. Dad.
Hey.|Sweetheart. Oh sorry were late, my fault, I insisted on riding the tube.
Hey.|Judy, the kids..
Hey.|Jack, that’s what they call the subway.
Hey.|Ohh, I thought that you....
Hey.|Dad, dad. We got it!! We Got It!!!
Hey.|Ohh, here comes my dad and stepmum. Mister and Misses Geller, this is Steven and Andrea Waltham.
Hey.|She’s very self-absorbed, you know. I should never have married her.
Hey.|Sorry, what?
Hey.|It’s the Gellers!
Hey.|Where?
Hey.|Well there’s one .
Hey.|Lovely to meet you.
Hey.|Terribly nice of you to offer to pay for half the wedding.
Hey.|Ohh forget it. Too hell with tradition, we’re happy to do it.
Hey.|We know how expensive weddings can be, besides this may be the only wedding we get to throw .
Sir?|What’s in it?
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.|Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can’t even remember what Phoebe looks like.
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.|Joey, it’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.|
What the hell!!!|what’s up, Dad?
This bill for my half of the wedding. it’s insane.|How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
I’m going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.|Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.|Ooh, Jack....
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.|
Hi.|Hello.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?|There’s one leaving in thirty minutes.
Ohh, good.|And I do have one seat left.
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.|The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
Ohh, I just don’t think I have enough left on my credit card.|Well you can split it with another credit card.
Ohh, okay, how about five.  Ohh, thank you.|I’m just going to need to see your passport.
|
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.|Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he’s going to laugh in my face.|This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement.  Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he’s going to laugh in my face.|Don’t take that tone with me.
Hi, Pheebs.|Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...

Well, thanks, we like him.|Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
Well, thanks, we like him.|All-right fine, but I just want to say, I’m not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren’t for us, cheap little man.
Well, thanks, we like him.|The guy was hammered, okay? There’s no way, you look like Ross’s mother.
Then why would he say it?|Because he’s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.

Okay, you know what/ You’re going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.|I can’t do that.
Sure, you know what? Come on, we’ll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".|I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.

Ahh Pheebs, you know you’re still my number one girl.|No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel’s coming to London.
Ohh great!!!|No it’s not great. No, she’s coming to tell Ross that she loves him.

I hate you!!|I know. How could we have let this happen?
I hate you!!|Seven times!
I hate you!!|Ugh! Well, y’know, we were away…
I hate you!!|In a foreign, romantic country…
I hate you!!|I blame London.
I hate you!!|Bad London!
I hate you!!|So look umm, while we’re st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
I hate you!!|Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it.
I hate you!!|Only here.
I hate you!!|Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…
I hate you!!|I’ll meet you there in two minutes.
I hate you!!|Okay!
I hate you!!|Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
I hate you!!|Now?
I hate you!!|Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?

I hate you!!|Monica, what should I do?
I hate you!!|Just uh, do the right thing.
I hate you!!|What?
I hate you!!|Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
I hate you!!|Whoa, wait, listen, I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.

I hate you!!|Oh, hi!
I hate you!!|Hi!
I hate you!!|Hi. Sorry, things aren’t working out so well.
I hate you!!|Oh no! It could be better, but it’s gonna be okay, right?
I hate you!!|Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she’s gonna get over this, y’know? I mean, so you said my name! Y’know you just said it ‘cause you saw me there, if you’d have seen a circus freak, you would’ve said, "I take thee circus freak." Y’know, it didn’t mean anything, it’s just a mistake. It didn’t mean anything. Right?
I hate you!!|No! No! Of course it didn’t mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y’know, because-because it was you…
I hate you!!|Right…
I hate you!!|But it absolutely didn’t.  It didn’t!! It didn’t!!
I hate you!!|Ross, hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so…
I hate you!!|Oh! Oh-oh, the band’s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says—I don’t care about the stupid band!!
I hate you!!|You spit on me man!
I hate you!!|Look, I’m sorry.
I hate you!!|Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
I hate you!!|Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
I hate you!!|Oh, right!
I hate you!!|Get the hell out of there, y’know?
I hate you!!|
I hate you!!|Well, look at that, same thing.
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.|Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Oh, hello Rachel.|Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!  Okay, don’t believe me, I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.|Yes, I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?
Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.|Fifteen minutes.
Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.|Okay.
Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.|Hello? Oh, Pheebs!  It’s Phoebe!
Oh, yay…|Great…
Oh, yay…|Hi!
Oh, yay…|Hi, so what happened?
Oh, yay…|Well, Ross said my name.
Oh, yay…|Yeah, I know, but I don’t think that means anything.
Oh, yay…|Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…
Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?|But my clothes are—ohh!
Wow, you look…|No time for that!
Wow, you look…|Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
Well, I’ve got a girl in here.|No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!|Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?|Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!
Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?|My Giant? I love that movie!
You really think this is okay?|Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.
Oh, it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this.|Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Okay!|Okay!
Okay!|Emily?!
Okay!|Nope, not under here!
You didn’t find her?|No, I’ve looked everywhere!
You didn’t find her?|Well, you couldn’t have looked everywhere or else you would’ve found her!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!|Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Or 45.|Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Or 45.|No! For all I know, she’s trying to find me but couldn’t because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I’m staying in one place.  Right here.
Well, it’s getting late.|Yeah, we’re gonna go.
Well, it’s getting late.|Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.|Yeah, it’s a very large plane.
Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.|That’s cool.
Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.|But, we’ll stay here with you.
Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.|Thanks guys!  I really appreciate this, y’know, but you don’t have to rub my butt.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.|I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think?
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|Em-Emily?
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|No.
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|You can forget about Emily, she’s not with us.
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|We’ve come for her things.
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|She’s in hiding. She’s utterly humiliated. She doesn’t want to see you ever again.
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|We’re very sad that it didn’t work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you’re absolutely delicious.
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|Excuse me, I’m standing right here!
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|Oh yes, there you are.
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|Goodbye Geller.
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|Now, hold on! Hold on!  That’s all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can’t imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you’ll tell her that.
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|All right, I’ll tell her.  Come on bugger face!
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|Call me.
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don’t you ever go out the bloody window!
Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.|Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y’know, technically we still are over international waters.
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|‘Kay!
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|Can I ask you something?
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|Uhh, no.
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|Felicity and I, we’re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I’m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I’m just wasting my life with this acting thing?
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|No.
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y’know, you think I’ll ever get there?
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|Yes.
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|Thanks man.
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|Okay man.
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|But what about how much taller he is than me?
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|I mean, there’s no way I can make myself taller now, y’know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|Hey, Monica, wow you’ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
I know!|Had the beef-tips, huh?
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hi!
|No we didn’t!
I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica.|Phoebe, I did not have sex.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.|All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Oh, me too!|Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days?
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Well, we certainly are alone.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Yes! Good thing we have that, ‘Not in New York’ rule.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Right. Umm, listen since we’re-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross’s mother…
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Right.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Well, an-anyway, I just—that night meant a lot to me, I guess I’m just trying to say thanks.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Oh. Y’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me ‘cause, you’re really hot! Is that okay?
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|That’s okay.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|And I’m cute too.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|And you’re cute too.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Thank you!  All right, I gotta go unpack.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Okay.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Bye.
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|I’m still on London time, does that count?
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|That counts!
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Oh, good!
Rach! Rach!|Hi!
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?|Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Oh.|Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Not yet.|So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Not yet.|This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
Pretty soon I guess.|Yeah. I’m sorry.
I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?|No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.
Same difference.|All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
I get it! Well, that’s that.|No, you know what, I think you should go.
What?|Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good.
Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…|Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
I could, yeah, I can do that.|Yeah.
I can’t, I can’t even believe her! No, y’know what, I am, I am gonna go!|Good!
I know, why not?|Right!
Right?|Right!
Y’know—thanks!|Okay, I’ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Yeah, well…nah.|What? Wait, what?
Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?|Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?
Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?|Uh-huh.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.|Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Okay!|Okay!

So you still hadn't heard from Emily?|Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?|Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?|What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?|Oh that's not true.
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?|Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
London is stupid! Stupid!|Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.|I'll do it!
Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.|That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.

Ohh.|…I mean it's my fault.
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!|Oh my God!
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.|I bet it was about her a little.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther!  I mean, he's nice, he's cute.|Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…
Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.|Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.|All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.|Say that to him and you're golden.

Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.|Well, it felt French.
Oh God, I really had a good time!|Yeah, me too.  So, I guess this is it.

Oh, honey that's awful.|Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
But, it's not raining.|I can't catch a break!
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right?  Hey, Dave!|Yeah?
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye!  Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.|Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah.|What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!|I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.|What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!|I make the decisions, and I say no.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.|You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Well…|Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!

I really need to talk to you.|Well, then talk!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?|Yes!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?|What thing?
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting.|Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God, think of the massacre.
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting.|I'm gonna do it.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.|But I…
Please!|All right, fine.

Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!|Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!|Park!
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!|Yeah, all of us! All day!
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!|That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!|Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!|Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just—y'know—stop it!
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!|I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!|That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.

Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!|Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!|Mine!

And, I came up with Atlantic City.|Come on Rach, let's go.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.|Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.|No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.|Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.|Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
And, I came up with Atlantic City.|Yeah, I-I don't care.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.|Okay. I-I can't watch.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.|What 'cha readin'?
The paper.|Yeah, what's it about?
Events from around the globe.|Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…|Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Yeah.|Okay.
Go ahead.|Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh,  I'm still in love with you Ross.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.|I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Why are you laughing?|Because  was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.|I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is.  "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!|Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…|The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
That is what the thing is.|Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.|That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.

I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!|Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
Do you know anything about women?|No.
That's all right.|Okay.

Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.|Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.|That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Yeah, he's head of the department.

Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Hello.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|That's what it sounded like.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|All right…
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Hey!
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Hey!

Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Yeah.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.|Oh my!
They're male nurses.|Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?|Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.|Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What?|Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.|Yep! There's always room for Jell-O…
Joey, how do you make that dirty?|Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad…
|Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either—Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!  Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
|Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.|Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.|So they're going on dates? When?
I think Saturday—.|What's with him?
I think Saturday—.|Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
I think Saturday—.|Okay!
I think Saturday—.|Hey.
I think Saturday—.|Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
I think Saturday—.|This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
I think Saturday—.|Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
I think Saturday—.|All right.
I think Saturday—.|It's not that weird, is it?
I think Saturday—.|It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
I think Saturday—.|To be fair, he doesn’t seem to be impersonating Fonzie…
I think Saturday—.|What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
I think Saturday—.|Again, it's not that he…
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!|Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.|Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Fine! Maybe I will too!|
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.|Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.|Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early…
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.|Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.|Oh no, I'm fully qualified to…
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.|Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.|Oh cool! You made him cry!
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.|Umm, well, what else could it be?
It's kidney stones.|Or?
All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.|They are. Why?
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.|Happy birthday!
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.|Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.|I know, it is.
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.|Yeah!
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.|Can I tell you a little secret?
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.|Yeah!
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.|I want to keep one.

Me too.|Hey! I just heard. What's up?
Me too.|Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra…
Me too.|Are you crazy?!
So did you ask him?|No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.|Oh Fonzie.

It's just Joey and Ross.|Why aren't you guys at the movie?
It's just Joey and Ross.|Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
It's just Joey and Ross.|I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
It's just Joey and Ross.|He's talking to London!
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?|Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?|I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?|Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?|-enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
Hey!|Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.|Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!|Oh that's great!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!|Ugh, PBS!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!|What's wrong with PBS?
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!|Ugh, what's right with them?
Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?|Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?|Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?|All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.|This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!|What-what are you talking about?!
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?|Yeah. So?
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.|Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Well, may I ask for one example?|Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!
That's because all people are selfish.|Are you calling me selfish?!
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|Hello.
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|Hello, Ross?
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily!  Hi!
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|Really? About what?
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|She's talking.
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
That he doesn't exist.|Right.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?|Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?|Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?|Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|I might've said that.  Why is that funny?
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|Because I'm very happy for him!  And you, you lucky dog!
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|Hi!
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|Hey!
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|Yes!
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|That's great!
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|In London!
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|What?!
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|She wants me to move to London.
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|But you live here!  You know that.
What-what-what are you gonna do?|I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
What-what-what are you gonna do?|Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
What-what-what are you gonna do?|It could happen.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!|This will be your phone.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.|No you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host!|No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.|Well, here's your phone doctor.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!|Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!|Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!|Sure!
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!|If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!|Chandler!  Is he?
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!|Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!|Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.|I understand that would be difficult.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?|I don't know, it's just…
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.|All right.
All right, did you just say all right?|I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!|Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Yes, tell me.|Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
I know. I am, I am so sorry.|And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Again, very sorry.|I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.|All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Oh that is so great! That's…|As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.|Yes!
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.|Ooh-ohh!
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.|Great!
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.|Why?
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.|What?! You can't—what did you tell her?
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!|Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!|Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!|Yeah.
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!|That's true!
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!|Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!|That's true!
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!|No, you cannot.

What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?|Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.|
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.|Back on in 30 seconds people!
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?|Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Come on man! You've been here all day!|Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
Come on man! You've been here all day!|We're on in 3, 2,
Come on man! You've been here all day!|Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil,
|A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
|Ooh, it's not a toy.
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!|All right, let me see.  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
PBS Telethon.|Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!|I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?|Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?|No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.|Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.|Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.|Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel—Oh no!
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.|Keep talking.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.|Really?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!|Well, if we owe it?  Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.|But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.|Yeah.
All right, let's show them how it's done.|Okay.
All right, let's show them how it's done.|Ow!
Y'know that wasn't part of it?|I know!
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!|For what?
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.|Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!|It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Like what?|Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.|No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!|Thanks.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.  Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!|
Never done that before.|Nope.
Hi!|
Hi!|Monica? What time is it?
Hi!|Uhh, 9.
Hi!|But it's dark out.
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.|I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.|I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.|Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!|Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.|Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.|I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.|Hey.
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.|Hey!
Hey.|Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
No, she's out shopping.|Damn!
No, she's out shopping.|What's going on?
No, she's out shopping.|I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
No, she's out shopping.|Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
No, she's out shopping.|Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|Doesn’t seem like it's going to work, I mean…
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|Hi, guys!
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|Hi!
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|Uh, hey!
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|What's going on?
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|We're flipping Monica's mattress.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|Yeah that's better than my way.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|Aww, man!
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|Oh look! A letter from my mom.
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|Oh yeah! I know.
Can you hear anything?|Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Can you hear anything?|Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
Can you hear anything?|Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
Can you hear anything?|Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles…
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!|Condoms?
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!|You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!|And condoms are the way to do that?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…|Oh my God! My dog died!
What?!|Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Le Poo's still alive?!|Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine- Oh my God.
Le Poo's still alive?!|Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
Le Poo's still alive?!|It's Le Poo.
Le Poo's still alive?!|I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
I can't believe it! We're here!|Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.|Come here.  Okay, be right back.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!|We're switching rooms.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!|No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?|Oh yeah!
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing… Okay, -Oh hey!|What?
You're nose is bleeding!|Oh God.  Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Umm…|Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.|Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.|Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.|Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
They say he's only got half a tank left.|We're switching rooms again.
They say he's only got half a tank left.|What? Why?
They say he's only got half a tank left.|This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.|Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.|Uh-huh.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.|Chandler!
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.|Yeah.
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.|Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.|I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
Okay, this one I like!|Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?|Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!|Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!|Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?|I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
What did you say?|I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Hi!|Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Okay, what's up?|Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.|And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…
Yeah?|…is for me not to see you anymore.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her?  Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?|It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!|You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.|What are you doing?
Storming out!|Rachel, this is your apartment.
Damn Rollos!|Hey, you're back!
Hey.|How was your conference?
It was terrible. I fought with|Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.|Hi!
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.|Hey, you're back too!
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.|Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.|Hey, how was your chef thing?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.|Oh, it was awful.  I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.|Chandler!
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.|Okay, fine, $300.
300 dollars?!|Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Urghh!!|What are you guys woofing about?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!|Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.|You want my advice?
Yes! Please!|You're not gonna like it.
That's okay.|You got married to fast.
That's not advice!|I told ya.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Yeah, me either.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Maybe I could do it.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Hi!
I'm going to the bathroom.|Hi, Rach.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Hi!
I'm going to the bathroom.|Hey.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Hey.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
I'm going to the bathroom.|I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
I'm going to the bathroom.|That's not Ross!
I'm going to the bathroom.|Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Hey, you're not Kip!
I'm going to the bathroom.|Do you even know who Kip is?
I'm going to the bathroom.|Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?
I'm going to the bathroom.|Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Oh, that poor bastard.
I'm going to the bathroom.|See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
I'm going to the bathroom.|You're not gonna be phased out!
I'm going to the bathroom.|Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother.  He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Ehh!!
I'm going to the bathroom.|Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
Hey!|Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Yes that was mine.|'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.|Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.  Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Phoebe?  You gotta come with me!|Come where?
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.|Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.|Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.|Oh, sure!  Forever.
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.|Hi.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?|I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Oh, Ross…|No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.|Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!|I can't believe this is happening.
I know.|I am so sorry.
I know that too.|Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Hey!|Hi.
I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?|Yeah, it did.
So, I guess this is over.|What?
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.|Why, exactly?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.|Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!
So, this isn't over?|You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Really? Okay. Great!|Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
We're in a relationship?|I'm afraid so.
Hey!|Hey!
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.|Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.|Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.|Yeah, it's in there.
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.|Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.|Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.|Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!|Yes. Yes.
And-and you?!|Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!|It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!|The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!|No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!|Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…|I know, it's great!
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"|Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Count for what?|Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Count for what?|I guess I'm done.
Count for what?|Fun's over!
Count for what?|Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
Count for what?|Uh-huh!
Count for what?|I think I'm gonna take-off.
Count for what?|Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!|What?!
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.|Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.|Okay.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.|Sorry.
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.|Sorry.
I can hear that!|Rachel's at work.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hello!
Hey!|Hey, what's that?
Eeeee-|Argh-argh!!  Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Hey!
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|How come? Everybody else does.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|You can't.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|What is that?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|This is all of your things.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's—Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|I'll take it all.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|After what I did? Can you blame her?
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.|What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.|Now calm down Joey.
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.|No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.|Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.|Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.|No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?|Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
I want the little round waffles.|All right.  Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Arghhhh!!!!!!|Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.|I'll take it!
That might work!|Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?
That might work!|You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
That might work!|
That might work!|What's the matter Ross?
That might work!|Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
Why?|Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Why?|That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
Why?|So you're really okay with this?
Why?|Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
Why?|Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
Why?|Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him?  Ow!! He's not even here!!!
Why?|You guys! You guys!
Why?|We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
Why?|It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
Why?|And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
Why?|Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
Why?|Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
Why?|Yeah!
Why?|Yeah, you fogged Danny.
Why?|Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
Why?|Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
Why?|Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
Yeah?|Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Yeah?|We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
Okay.|Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Yesss?|Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
Yesss?|Yeah.
O-kay!|Wow! That guy is so rude!
O-kay!|Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
O-kay!|Well you did a little bit.
O-kay!|Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
O-kay!|I totally forgive you!
O-kay!|Really?
O-kay!|Yes!
Hey!|Hey!
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?|Crematorium Chris? Sure!
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.|Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.|Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.|What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
|Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.|So, rocks.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.|Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.|Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…|You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Why?|It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
What's going on?|We all hate Emily!
What's going on?|Nooo!!
What's going on?|No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
What's going on?|Yeah!
What's going on?|Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
What's going on?|Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!|I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.|Oh, I know.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.|I kinda feel like it's my fault.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.|Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.|Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.|Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.|All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.|Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.|Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I—it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley!  Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
Hi!|So you like the short hair better.
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?|I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.|Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
What?|That's cool. Cool.
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!|Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!|Do you?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.|Okay.
And stop saying that! I hate that!|Okay!
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?|The pizza-place across the street any good?
What?!|I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Okay. Okay.|Stop saying that. I hate that.
Uh, Ross?|Are you still mad at us?
Uh, Ross?|Yep.
Uh, Ross?|Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
Uh, Ross?|Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
Uh, Ross?|Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
Yeah, we are so sorry.|
Yeah, we are so sorry.|Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
Yeah, we are so sorry.|Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
Yeah, we are so sorry.|Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
Yeah, we are so sorry.|Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
Yeah, we are so sorry.|Yes! Exactly! And that's why…
Yeah, we are so sorry.|Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
Yeah, we are so sorry.|Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
Yeah, we are so sorry.|Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.|You do, huh?
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone…|What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.|Hi!
I'm not sure.|Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
I'm not sure.|Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
I'm not sure.|How did that happen?
I'm not sure.|That yeti is one smooth talker.
I'm not sure.|I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
I'm not sure.|Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
I'm not sure.|No! Why?
I'm not sure.|Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really… I don't mind.
I'm not sure.|Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh… It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
I'm not sure.|Ross, I…
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!|Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!|I haven't seen him in so long!
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!|Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!|Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!|It's almost as if he knew.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!|I'll get it.
Hey!  Hold on.|Hi Emily!
Hey!  Hold on.|Hi!
Hey!  Hold on.|Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
Hey!  Hold on.|Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
Hey!  Hold on.|Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!|She's there?!
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!|Oh yeah, there-there she is!
Yeah, yeah, she's here.|Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Hi.|How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?|You obviously can't keep away from her.
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.|I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.|You're right.
So, can you trust me?|No.
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.|How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.|Well, I guess that's it.
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.|Why, what happened?
What happened? What happened?|My marriage is over.
What happened? What happened?|What?!
What happened? What happened?|Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
What happened? What happened?|Here.
What happened? What happened?|Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
What happened? What happened?|Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?|No, look.
That's a pig.|I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Hey!|Emily's cousin kicked me out!
What?!|Why?
What?!|Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?|Who needs a lease when it's family!
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?|Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!|Yeah.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!|You got it.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!|Okay.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!|Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!|What?

He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try…|Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.|Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?|I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.

Ohh, fun!|Ohh, great!
Ohh, fun!|Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
Ohh, fun!|Yeah.
Ohh, fun!|Okay, see ya.
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.|Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
And you're not gonna do that.|That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So-so there is no party.|No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.|Exactly.
Ross?|Hey roomies!
Ross?|Love what you've done with the place.
Ross?|Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.|Oh yeah!
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.|Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out.  We will, we will, call you back!
Hey, all right!|Pretty cool, huh?
You're fake laughing too, right?|Oh, the tears are real.

Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies  have been.|You are just nonstop!

No-no, but I support it.|Take care.
Okay.  Walked right into that one didn't he?|What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.|Great. So the ball is in his court?
|Sorry.
|Ahhhhhhhhhh…
|Hello children!
|Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
|Okay.
|No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
|All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
|Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
|No, the quiet down thing!
|You mean this.
|Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
|All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!

|Um-hmm.
Hey!|Hey!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!|Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!

Umm, yum!|It's Danny.
Umm, yum!|Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.

Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?|But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!|Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.|Thank you.  Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!|Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!|Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
Yeah!|What are we gonna do?

Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.|Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?|Are you aware that you're still talking?
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?|Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?|Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?|Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.

Is it not there?|No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?|Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?|Oh God, no.
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!|It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.|More turkey Mr. Chandler?
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.|I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.|Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.|Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
In this life, Phoebe.|Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
In this life, Phoebe.|Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
In this life, Phoebe.|Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
In this life, Phoebe.|I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
In this life, Phoebe.|Oh, let's not tell this story.
In this life, Phoebe.|Oh, come on!
In this life, Phoebe.|Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
In this life, Phoebe.|What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
In this life, Phoebe.|Hey, it's not like it sounds.
In this life, Phoebe.|It's exactly like it sounds.
Hello?|Hello?
Phoebe?|Joey? What's going on?
Look.|Oh my God!

It's Joey.|No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
It's Joey.|Well, get it off now!
I can't! It-it's stuck!|Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!

It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!|I'm over here big guy.
You did look like an idiot.|Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
You did look like an idiot.|Yeah that's the same.
You did look like an idiot.|That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
You did look like an idiot.|Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
You did look like an idiot.|Which one?
You did look like an idiot.|Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.|Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!|I'll get it!  Happy Thanksgiving!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!|Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!|Oh, why? Why? What happened?
Monica! I think Rachel's here!|Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over…
Monica! I think Rachel's here!|Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
Monica! I think Rachel's here!|Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me!  Hi!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!|Hi Rachel!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!|Happy Thanksgiving!
You too sweethart!|Hey!

I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.|Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|dammit!

Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|Well, that's cool. So did…
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly.  Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|Call them mom and dad you loser!
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|Monica!
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?|Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Okay!|Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Oh that's so great!|I know!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.|Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!|I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.|Emotional Knapsack?
Yeah.|Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.

All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.|No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Hey!|Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
Hey!|No. No, thank you!
Hey!|Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!

Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!|We'll try to be more careful okay? It's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!|I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!|We are! Help us!

Hey, Phoebe!|Hey, Pheebs!
Hey, Phoebe!|Hey, Pheebs!
Hey, Phoebe!|What are you reading?
Hey, Phoebe!|Umm, Wethering Heights. I'm taking a literature class at the New School and I have to finish it for the first session tomorrow.
Hey, Phoebe!|I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
Hey, Phoebe!|Yeah! Well, I really liked that Lamaze class I took! Y'know and this time I thought I'd go for something, y'know a little more intellectual, with a less painful final exam.
Hey, Phoebe!|Honey that sounds like fun.
Hey, Phoebe!|Yeah! Ooh, you should come with me! Oh yeah, then I'd have someone to sit with!
Hey, Phoebe!|Okay.
Hey, Phoebe!|Yeah! Okay—ooh, but are you going to have time to read it?
Hey, Phoebe!|Oh, I read that in high school.
Hey, Phoebe!|This is going to be so much fun! Okay-shhh, I have to finish.
Hey, Phoebe!|Hi.
Hey, Phoebe!|What's wrong buddy?
Hey, Phoebe!|Someone at work ate my sandwich!
Hey, Phoebe!|Well, what did the police say?
Hey, Phoebe!|My Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. I can't believe someone ate it!
Hey, Phoebe!|Ross, it's just a sandwich!
Hey, Phoebe!|Just a sandwich? Look, I am 30 years old, I'm about to be divorced twice and I just got evicted! That sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life! Someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but|That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but|Knock-knock. Who's there? Ross Geller's lunch. Ross Geller's lunch, who? Ross Geller's lunch, please don't take me. Okay?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but|I'm surprised you didn't go home wearing your lunch.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but|Okay, look you wanna hold onto your food? You gotta scare people off. I learned that living on the street.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but|Really?! So what would you say Pheebs? Stuff like uh, "Keep your mitts off my grub?"
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but|Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but|Okay, this will keep them away from your stuff.
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but|Whoa! Ohh!!
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!|Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Phoebe?|Well, he stabbed me first!!
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.|Okay.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?|I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?|Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?|How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.|Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.|Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here…
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.|You completely stole my answer!
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|What do you think? You in the blue shirt.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|I think that uh, yours is a question with many answers.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|Would ya care to venture one?
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|Would you care to venture one?
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|Are you just repeating what I'm saying?
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|All right, let's move on.
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|Okay then.
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!|Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!|Phoebe!
Yeah?|Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
Yeah?|Yeah, the best you got in high school was Wet Pants Geller.
Yeah?|That was the water fountain! Okay?! Anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule, I'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.  Hey Tribbiani, give me that coffee! Now!
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.|So you uh, still wondering?
No, we just went out.|You're smart. I like that.
Oh, candles!|Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!|Hiya.
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!|Joey, is what she just said umm—Oh my God.
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!|What is going on here?
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!|And with Chandler in the next room. What are you, what are you sick?
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!|I'm Joey. I mean, I'm disgusting. I make low-budget adult films.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!|We're so sorry.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!|Yeah.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!|No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?|Oh—I don't know.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!|Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?|Yeah, of course, Donald.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.|What?!
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.|Yeah.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.|Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
A sandwich?|Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…
Oh, you know what?|What?
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.|You ate my sandwich?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.|Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
No.|Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.|That said it was my sandwich?!
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.|What?
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.|You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
Hi!|Hi!
So umm, what's this book about?|You didn't read this one either?!
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.|What?
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.|No! You should've read it yourself!
Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!|Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!|Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!|Sorry I'm late. Let's get started. So, what did everybody think about Jane Eyre?
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!|Umm, Rachel and I were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!|Well, go ahead Rachel.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.|If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Hey.|Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
You're naked in this picture!|I know.
Ross?|Monica!
Ross?|Ross, are you okay?
Ross?|I'm fine! I saw a psychiatrist at work today.
Ross?|Why?!
Ross?|On account of my rage.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.|He gave me a pill for it.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.|A pill?
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.|Uh-huh. Well, when the psychiatrist told me I had to take a leave of absence because I yelled at my boss I started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer. And I thought was a good idea so, I took it.
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.|Wait a minute, they're making you take time off work?
And you're okay with that?|I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!|I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That was not funny!|Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!|Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
I know! I know! I know!|Monica, you asked the question.
Oh my God! That's Monica!!|Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!|What's going on?
Joey has got a secret peephole!|
Look!|
Look!|Give me that!
Look!|All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!
Look!|No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just… I just… Kinda…
Look!|All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.
Look!|Thank you!
Look!|Joey's a sex addict.
Look!|What?!!  No I'm not!!
Look!|It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!
Look!|No! No! I am not a sex addict!
Look!|Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!
Look!|No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!
Well, what is the truth?|Yeah, what's going on?
Well, what is the truth?|What's going on?
Well, what is the truth?|I slept with Monica.
Well, what is the truth?|Well let's….let's see what everybody thinks of that?
Well, what is the truth?|Oh no!
Well, what is the truth?|You slept with my sister?
Well, what is the truth?|Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.
Well, what is the truth?|This is not good for my rage.
Monica, is this true?|Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Monica, is this true?|Yes it's true.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?|Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?|I guess I wanted to keep it  as a souvenir.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?|My God Monica!!
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?|Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?|No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?|So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?|That makes sense!
And the video camera?|Uhh, Monica?
And the video camera?|I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
And the video camera?|But sadly I could not be enticed.
And the video camera?|Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
And the video camera?|I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
And the video camera?|Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.|Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know! I didn't come with her!|All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
I don't know! I didn't come with her!|A test?!!
I don't know! I didn't come with her!|Come on! Tests make us all better learners! Oh yeah!  We should have essay questions!!
What are you doing?|I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy.
Why are you doing this?|Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?|Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!
Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok.  Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!|So what, we just sit?
Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit.|Hello, Chandler Bing.

Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.|Ohh.

Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city.|So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?

She’s a woman!|What can I say? She nailed it.
Okay, is there anything else?|Well, you’re just going to say no again but...gay porn.

But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.|I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…|Bite me, blondie!
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!|I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Wait a second, I could star in it!|Or that.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.|I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!|Yeah!
Thanks!|All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Done!|And it can't be Joey.
It's not.|Or Joseph.
Hey, what's up?|I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.|Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
You had no relationship!!|No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.|She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?|Why?
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.|Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
You're driving me crazy with that!|Okay, I'll stop.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.|You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.|Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?|I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.|Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.|Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
All right.  The official rulebook of Fireball.|Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
All right.  The official rulebook of Fireball.|
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!|You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Now come on!|Hey!

Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.|Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.|That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.|Maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends, especially the ones who may soon be flying you to Europe for free on their own plane.
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.|She has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.|I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  And it starts right now!
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.|All right, my New Year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar.
Ohh.|Really?! How come?
Ohh.|Well, y'know those special skills I have listed on my resume? I would love it would be great if one of those was true.
Ohh.|Do you want me to teach you? I'm a great teacher.
Ohh.|Really? Who-who have you taught?
Ohh.|Well, I taught me and I love me.
Ohh.|Yeah that'd be great! Thanks Pheebs!
Ohh.|Op, look! Claire forgot her glasses! And she's gonna be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend, who, I hear, needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer, if you know what I'm talking about.
Ohh.|Hey Rach, maybe your resolution should be to umm, gossip less.
Ohh.|I don't gossip!
Ohh.|Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?
Ohh.|Well if Ted Kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs, I would.
Ohh.|What? They were like this!
I'll see you tomorrow.|Okay!  Hey!
I'll see you tomorrow.|Hey!
I'll see you tomorrow.|I just asked that girl out.
I'll see you tomorrow.|Nice!
I'll see you tomorrow.|Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?
I'll see you tomorrow.|Yes it is. See.
I'll see you tomorrow.|Elizabeth Hornswoggle?
I'll see you tomorrow.|That's right, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.
I'll see you tomorrow.|Horn-swoggle.
I'll see you tomorrow.|You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?
I'll see you tomorrow.|No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before.
I'll see you tomorrow.|Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet!
I'll see you tomorrow.|Hi, Pheebs!
I'll see you tomorrow.|Hey!
I'll see you tomorrow.|Oh-oh, guess what? I-I have a date with Elizabeth  Hornswoggle.
I'll see you tomorrow.|Hornswoggle?  Ooh, this must be killing you.
I'll see you tomorrow.|All right, see you later.
I'll see you tomorrow.|See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson.
I'll see you tomorrow.|Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.|Umm, okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.|Okay, lesson one: chords. Now, I don't know the actual names of the chords but umm, I-I-I made up names for the way my hand looks while I'm doing them.
I'll see you tomorrow.|What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.|I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.|Hey, Pheebs! Check-check this out.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!|Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and…
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!|No.
Give me your hands.  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?|Yes!
Then don't touch one!!|Hi!
Then don't touch one!!|Hi!
Then don't touch one!!|Hi Ben!

Then don't touch one!!|I think they're very nice.
Then don't touch one!!|I like 'em.
Then don't touch one!!|Yeah!
Then don't touch one!!|I like them a lot.
Then don't touch one!!|That's not what I had in mind! See, people like Ross don't generally wear these types of pants. You see, they're very tight.  Maybe there's something in that area.
Then don't touch one!!|Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, "Wow,  I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before."
Then don't touch one!!|Oh come on!!
Then don't touch one!!|Okay, seriously, what do you think?
Then don't touch one!!|You look like a freak.
Then don't touch one!!|Awful, absolutely awful.
Then don't touch one!!|What are you, what are you doing?
Then don't touch one!!|It's my New Year's resolution!
Then don't touch one!!|What, to blind my child?
Then don't touch one!!|No! To take more pictures of all of us together. I mean I really think it's the best resolution because everyone will enjoy the pictures.
Then don't touch one!!|Well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.
Are you hot?|No.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?|No, go ahead.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….|Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Tiger!  Joseph, did you even study at all last night?|Yes! Yes, I did.
Then do Iceberg!|G-sharp.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords?  Oh my God!|What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
No, but you're questioning my method!|No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!
No, but you're questioning my method!|Thank you.
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.|Your other student, was you!
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!|
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!|"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Oh, fine! Take his side!|I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Oh, fine! Take his side!|
Oh, fine! Take his side!|Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…
Oh, fine! Take his side!|Arghh!!
Hello?|Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Uhh, Chandler's not here.|Well, you can help me!
Okay.|Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom…
Nice!|No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?|Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.|Yeah, okay, hold on!  They're not coming on man.
Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline?|Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.|Hold on.
Ross? You okay?|They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?|What difference does that make?!
Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!|Joey, do you have a minute?
Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!|Dude, what am I gonna…
|Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.|Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
What-what is it, what is it?|Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!|Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!|What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!|I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone…
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.|All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Oh my God!|I had a problem.
Hey, Pheebs?|No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.  You really think I'm ready?|Uh-huh!
Was the chord at least right…|No!
Oh my God!|We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Oh my God!|This year was supposed to be great! But, it's only the second day and I'm a loser with stupid leather pants that don't even fit!
Oh my God!|No. No, you're not a loser.
Oh my God!|Look at me!
Oh my God!|Hey, hey, look. Look Ross, Ben drew a picture of you!  Huh? You're-you're a cowboy!
Oh my God!|Oh, be-because of the leather pants.
Oh my God!|See? Ben doesn't think you're a loser, he thinks you're a cowboy! Now that's something.
Oh my God!|Yeah!
Oh my God!|That really is something; that's really cool.
Oh my God!|Howdy partner!
Oh my God!|Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides.
Oh my God!|Okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, I think I'm, I'm gonna go do my laundry.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.|Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.

Hey Ross!|What? Oh!
Hey Ross!|Sorry man.
Hey Ross!|Here's your scone.
Hey Ross!|Oh, thanks Gunther.  STUPID BRITISH SNACK FOOD!!!!!!!
Hey Ross!|Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
Hey Ross!|Hey, you know what might help you deal with it? Think of it this way, you and Emily are in the past and you can't be mad about the past. So are you still mad about the Louisiana Purchase?
Hey Ross!|Pheebs, I don’t think anyone's mad about that.
Hey Ross!|Exactly! Because it's in the past!
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?|Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.|I know, I can do this.
Ooh, and I can do this.|We can't do that.
Ooh, and I can do this.|Hey Bing!  Wo-ho-ho, who's the pretty lady and what the hell is she doing with you?
Ooh, and I can do this.|I asked myself that very question, sir. Uh,  This is my boss, Doug. Doug this is Monica.

What was that?|What?
That noise you just made?|Oh, that was my work laugh.
Really? Your work laugh?|Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
All right, check me out.|Okay.
All right, check me out.|…says $30 Father; same as in town.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!|Really?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.  Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.|Hey, I thought you already had one.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks.  Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?|Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Okay, good luck with that.|Hey!
Okay, good luck with that.|Hi!
Okay, good luck with that.|What's up?!
Okay, good luck with that.|What are you doing here? I thought you had to do inventory all day.
Okay, good luck with that.|Well yeah, I do, but I decided to take a long lunch and spend some time with my friend Monica. Y'know I-I feel that we don't talk anymore. How are you? What is new with you?
Okay, good luck with that.|Uhh, not much. Uh, work's good.
Okay, good luck with that.|Oh y'know what, we don’t have to talk about work. We can talk about anything!
Okay, good luck with that.|Okay. Umm…
Okay, good luck with that.|Hey! Y'know what? Let's talk about relationships!
Okay, good luck with that.|Okay, what's going on with you?
Okay, good luck with that.|Nothing! You go!
Okay, good luck with that.|Well, I-I—there was this guy at the bank that I thought was cute umm, but I don't anymore.
Okay, good luck with that.|Wow that's uh, juicy. Umm,  y'know what though Mon, I actually do have a lot of work to do so if-if—are you sure there's just not anything else?
Okay, good luck with that.|Yes, I'm sure! Rachel is there something that you want to talk me about?
Okay, good luck with that.|No!  If there was I wouldn't tell you.
You'll get your turn!|Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Nothing!  This is not over!|No! No! No!

Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.|Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?  Please let them win!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.|I'll take it down to 95% but that's the best I can do.

I was frustrated.|It was my racquet.
I was frustrated with you!|If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!"  I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.|Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.

I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.|Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.|That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.|Hey!

Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!|Just, y'know out.

Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!|What were you doing?
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!|I uh, went to a bar. And then I just uh, just walked around for a while.
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!|You walked around all night in the city by yourself?

Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!|Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!|He hooked up!! Tell us about her!
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!|Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.|Oh, nobody's judging you.
Oh! Okay!|Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…
Oh! Okay!|You two will have very hairy children.
Oh! Okay!|Okay, I didn't know you would say that.
Oh! Okay!|Ross! Janice?!
Oh! Okay!|All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.
Oh! Okay!|Look, I didn't lose my mind! Okay, Janice and I have a lot in common! We've-we've both been divorced. We-we both have kids.
Oh! Okay!|So are you actually gonna see her again?
Oh! Okay!|Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!
Oh! Okay!|I am gonna see her again.
Oh! Okay!|Damnit Phoebe!!
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!|My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.|What?!
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."|Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.|Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big……ot.
What?!|Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.|Me and Chandler?!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?|Uh-hmm.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.|Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules, no violation.|Ohhh.
Judge rules, no violation.|Hey guys!
Judge rules, no violation.|Hey!
Yeah!|Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
What?!|Are you serious?!
What?!|Yeah! I opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me. I mean I talked for hours.  It is amazing to have someone give you such-such focused attention.
What?!|You don't need Janice for that, you've got us. We…
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!|No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.|Ohh, tough call.
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.|So how do you kids like your coffee?
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.|Oh, none for me. Thanks.
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.|Just a little bit of sugar.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?|How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?|Oh, you get used to it.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?|Y'know, I-I-I don't think that I can. So if you don't mind, maybe this will be it for me on the work things.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?|So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?|I'd rather hang out with a sniveling work weasel guy when I can be hanging out with my boyfriend who I actually respect.
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?|Oh.
Did you hear what I said Bing?|What?
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?|Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Excuse me?|Well, I just…
Excuse me?|Honey, I just don't think that you understood the joke.
Excuse me?|Really?
Excuse me?|Yeah! I mean it was really funny, I-I just don't think you got it. You see Kara's coffee is-is-is weak tasting, okay? But-but what Doug was-was imply that it was weak physically. You get it now honey?
Excuse me?|I think I do!  Thank you, Monica.
Excuse me?|I thought you could use the help.
Excuse me?|Coffee in a fight!
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?|Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.|What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!|Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!|I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Joey?! Oh my God, Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Hey! Hi!
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Wh-wh-what are you doing here? (She tries to pull her shirt down to cover the fact that she's wearing men's boxers.]
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Well, I was actually—I-I came over here to-to borrow this lamp. To umm, look at my books, y'know, see them a little better.
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Okay great!
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Yeah!
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Great! Umm, well what-what I was doing in Chandler's room is that umm, I was cleaning it! In fact, he pays me to clean it!
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Oh! What a great way to earn some extra pocket money.
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Y'know when I said to you earlier that I was at work umm, I'm at my new work.
But we're not ready to tell yet!|That's good enough. Right?  Okay, well umm, I'm gonna go look at my books!
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Okay.
But we're not ready to tell yet!|Okay.
But we're not ready to tell yet!|I'll get back to my new job.
But we're not ready to tell yet!|'Kay.
Here you go.|Thanks!
Here you go.|Actually, I should get going.
Here you go.|Are you sure? Because I can stay out as late as you want. I told you how I'm on sabbatical from work, right?
Here you go.|Yes! Yes! You did!
Here you go.|Oh…
Here you go.|What is wrong now?!
Here you go.|This isn't what I ordered! Man! Can anything go right in my life?! First my marriage falls apart and then…
Here you go.|I know! I know! And then you lose your apartment! And then you lose your job! And then your ex-wife gets married so fast! And now the coffee—ahh!! Ross, we need to talk.
Here you go.|Okay. Sometimes I feel…
Here you go.|No-no-no, no. I'm going to talk. I believe that the sun has set on our day in the sun.
Here you go.|Huh?
Here you go.|You're a very sweet person Ross, umm, unfortunately I don't think I can take another second of you whining!!
Here you go.|Let-let me make sure I'm hearing this right, you're ending this with me because I'm too whiney?  So you're saying, I've become so whiney that I annoy you, Janice.
Here you go.|Well yeah!!
Here you go.|OH…MY…GOD!!
Here you go.|Are you gonna be okay?
Here you go.|I am now.
Here you go.|Okay.
Here you go.|Umm, hi.
Here you go.|Oh hi! Well, I guess that's two out of three, Joey.
Dude, we got to talk.|Okay.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice.  What you're-you're not mad?|Why would I be mad?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.|I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Okay.|I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
All right.|And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down—let's write it down!
All right.|Seth Kirkland
All right.|Michael Curtis
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!|Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
That was a half an hour?|It's your timer.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!|All right, then massage me up right nice!
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!|Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
It's so good, isn't it?|It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!|Good-bye muscles!!
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was!|Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.|Hey.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.|Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.|Sorry.
|This would be the place where you explain the hat.
|Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.|Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Done.|Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Done.|Great! Thanks, Rach!
Done.|Sure!  God, please take those off!
Done.|All right.
Done.|Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
Hey.|Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
Hey.|What?
Hey.|Is everything okay?
Hey.|Are you all right?
Hey.|Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
Hey.|Pheebs! Sorry!
Hey.|It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
Hey.|Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
Hey.|Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
Hey.|Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
Hey.|Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
Hey.|Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
Hey.|It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
Hey.|Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
Hey.|Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
Hey.|Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
Hey.|It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?|All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.|Really? A purse?
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.|It looks like a women's purse.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look, men, carrying the bag.|See look, women, carrying the bag.  But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Exactly! Unisex!|Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.|Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Who is it?|It's Phoebe.
Oh great!  Oh, you. Umm, what's up?|Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Umm, yeah—no thanks.|Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?|No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.|No you didn't!
Well, then who's been dead for five years?|Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So… I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.|Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!

What?|My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.|Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.|I'm crying here!!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.|Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!|So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Absolutely!|Okay. I suck!
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.|Thank you. All right.
Come, sit.  Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.|Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Okay.|So, what did Francis leave me?
Huh?|Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm,  this lipstick.|Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's  oh it's—ew used. Umm, cool.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms.  You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?|Yes, yes I was.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?|It really says that?!
Yeah. See?|Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?|Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much.
What?!|Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?|Yeah, yeah. Why?
Lilly's dead.|She what?!
She's dead.|Are you sure?
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.|I can't believe this. I just—I can't believe this. How-how—Oh my God. How long ago?
17 years ago.|Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!|Phoebe, I-I-I-umm,  I just, I-I-I-I don’t, I don’t know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.|So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.|All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
That's a defense?|Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
You make up songs?|Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
You make up songs?|I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm…
Hi.|Hey!
Hi.|Hey man, how did the audition go?
Estelle said I didn't get it.|What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.|What kind of problem?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!|Oh my God!
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!|Nooooo!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!|Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?  Oh, you think I should give up the bag!|Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it…
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?  Oh, you think I should give up the bag!|Oh, hey!
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?  Oh, you think I should give up the bag!|…I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!|Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
I can't believe I'm hearing this!|Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!|I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.

Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.|No. Joey, she knows! We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window.  Actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?|Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.|Wh-what do you mean?
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.|Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.|No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.|Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.|I can't take any…
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!|Noo! I can't take any more secrets!  I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!|You don't have any secrets!
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!|Oh yeah? Well, you don't know about Hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!|So umm, how-how are we gonna mess with them?
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!|Ugh.
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.|Okay.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.|Hello children!
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.|Hey!
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.|Hey.
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!|Really?
Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?|Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things.  Are you okay?
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.|Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.|What's going on?
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?|Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!|Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
What?|The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?|I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
That's not possible!|Ow!
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.|Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.|No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
This bicep?|Well it's not flexed right now!
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?|Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Oh.|Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Oh.|Sure, I'll do it with ya.
Oh.|Okay.
Okay great, hold on a sec!  Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!|I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Okay great, hold on a sec!  Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!|I have quarters!
Okay great, hold on a sec!  Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!|Hey!
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?|Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Oh.|No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
Oh.|Oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?
Oh.|No.
Oh.|That new mountain bike?
Oh.|No.
Oh.|Well what did you send?
Oh.|A basket of mini-muffins.
Oh.|But there's a whole table of mini-muffin baskets. Which one did you send?
Oh.|The small one.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?|Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?|Your work makes me sad.
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?|Oh man! I want that place so much!! I was so sure that was gonna work! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Bye!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Bye!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Bye Chandler!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Actually, I did!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Are you serious?
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Phoebe knows and she's just trying to freak us out! That's the only explanation for it!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps—She knows!
Joey!|Yeah?
Phoebe knows about us!|Well I didn't tell them!
Phoebe knows about us!|Them?! Who's them?
Phoebe knows about us!|Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Phoebe knows about us!|Joey!
Phoebe knows about us!|And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Oh man!|I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Oh man!|Unless…
Oh man!|No! Not unless! Look this must end now!
Oh man!|Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So…
Noooo.|Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Noooo.|Yeah, why don't you just find another apartment?
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!|Y'know what you should do?
Huh?|You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
Huh?|I'm listening.
Huh?|See?
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.|He broke that.
Well, he had gravity boots.|Yeah, he broke those too.
Well, he had gravity boots.|So he likes to break stuff.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?|I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?|Yeah, poor cat, never saw that big butt coming.
Right.|Hello!  It's Chandler.
Right.|Hello you.
Right.|Hello Phoebe, I've been thinking about you all day.
Right.|Eh?
Right.|Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.
Right.|Really?
Right.|Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more.
Right.|I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye!  Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
Right.|Are you kidding?!
Right.|No!
Right.|I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa!  Joey, do they know that we know?
Right.|No.
Right.|Joey!
Right.|They know you know.
Right.|Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
Right.|God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey, you can't say anything!
Right.|I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Look at them, they're-they're panicked!|Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.|All right. Be sexy.
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.|Really?
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?|Yes.
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.|Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.|Oh yeah!
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.|Yeah, it is! Naked Ross!!
Show time!|Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Okay!|And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!|Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!|How do you know?!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!|At this?!
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!|Okay.

He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Ooh!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Okay!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|I like that!
Joey!  Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.|It's not my first time.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!|Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?
Oh, you're-you're going?|Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra.

And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.|Well actually, Ross doesn't.
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.|I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.|I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?

You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!|Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
What? What? What?! You guys knew?  You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!|Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
|Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business?  Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…|Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…|I call Godfather!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Guys, you're a few steps ahead of us.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Oh! Oh, I just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Ooh, I'll go in on that with you! I couldn't think of anything.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Okay.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Oh, hey Katie! Everyone, this is Katie.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Hi!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Hi!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|So, are you ready to go?
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Yeah, I just gotta run to the bathroom.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Oh sure, right back there.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Hey, where are we going to lunch?
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|I was thinking Chinese food.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Ohh, I love Chinese! How did you know I love Chinese?!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|She is so cute! You could fit her right in your little pocket!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|I don't know. I mean I like her a lot, and she's really nice, but…
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|But what?
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|She keeps punching me.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|In that cute, little, sweet way she just did?
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Hey, it's a lot harder than it looks! Okay?  She-she-she's hurting me.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|I know what you need, you need a bodyguard. Hey Ross, what is Ben doing after preschool?
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up.
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Aww, Joey, come here.  Look honey, I know this must be really, really difficult for you and I--Oh, I'm sorry. Am I hurting you?
Hey!|Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Aww.|Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Huh.|Bread, so you never go hungry.
Ohh.|And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.|Yeah!
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.|Hi!
Hi!|Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.|Oh hi Phoebe.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.|Mr. President.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.|I came to talk to you about Howard.
Howard?|Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
Oh that's nice.|Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or…
Oh. Uhh…|Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in.|Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.|Oh, okay, I get it.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.|Howard's the handy man!
Yes but too me he's just, man.|Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Ugh, can you believe that guy!|Yeah. I really like his glasses.
…so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.|Sounds like a fun party.
…so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.|Hmm. Look, Ross, if you want your neighbors to like you, why don't you just pay the hundred bucks? The party's gonna cost you way more than that.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!|Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|Umm, Chandler, you do realize that those ideas are probably already in Monica's head.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|Wh-wh-why?!
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|Well, because she loves you and because you love her.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|Hey, Chandler, don't freak out! I'm telling you something you already know! Come on, she broke up with Richard because he didn't want to have babies. And she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and y'know it's Monica.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! I’m right. I'm right. Am I right?
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|No, you're right, you are absolutely right. I mean that makes, that makes everything different.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|Okay. It's not different at all, is it?
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|Not unless different means the same.
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!|Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!|Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Isn't this great?|Hmm.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?|Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Are you okay?|Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
What-what are you doing?|I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!|What?!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.|Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Oh and you know what I want!|Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I do not have baby fever!|Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!|Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!|Well, I did not know that.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.|Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
By me?|Oh, no!
By me?|No-no.
By me?|Well, unless you make some kind of big gesture.
By me?|Yeah, big!
By me?|Uh-oh, shht! The Misses.
By me?|Gunther, can I get a coffee  to go?
Monica.|I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.|What?!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.|Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!|Phoebe!

Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!|Yeah, but they didn't ask me! Y'know? This way I'm just y'know, the exotic, generous stranger. That's always fun to be.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!|Yeah, but you're making me look bad!
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!|No I'm not. No! If anything I'm making you look better! They'll see you talking to me and that's--I'm a hit!

Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!|Oh hey, Ross. Umm, see, I was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments because Phoebe's more our kind of people. Something to think about.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!|Yeah, okay, my bad.
Hey!|Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?|Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?|Hi!
Hey! Hiya!|Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Hey! Hiya!|Oh, thanks! That's so sweet!
Hey! Hiya!|Oh! Ow!
Hey! Hiya!|Oh, ow! Did Joey tell you to say that? You guys,
Hey! Hiya!|Whoa!
Hey! Hiya!|Ohh, Joey has the nicest friends!
Hey! Hiya!|Ohh, and the nicest girlfriend!
Hey! Hiya!|You're so sweet!
Hey! Hiya!|Ohh, you're so sweet!
Hey! Hiya!|Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.
Huh.|Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Uhh….|You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Phoebe?|
Phoebe? Phoebe?|Ooh.
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?|No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
So uh, what did you tell them about me?|Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Ohh.|But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
What?!|Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Ohh, this cake is really good!|Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Ohh, this cake is really good!|Who would do a think like that?
Ohh, this cake is really good!|3-B!
Ohh, this cake is really good!|Oh yeah, aww!
Ohh, this cake is really good!|Okay, you got your free food! You ruined everyone's fun! Don't you think it's time you went home?!
Ohh, this cake is really good!|Yeah, leave!
Ohh, this cake is really good!|Yeah, get out! Now!
Ohh, this cake is really good!|Go back to 3-B, 3-B!
Ohh, this cake is really good!|All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross?  cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.|Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?|I'm Monica.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!|Okay.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.|Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Monica…|No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Will you marry me?|Oh-no. No. No.
Will you marry me?|What a bad idea!
Will you marry me?|Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!
Will you marry me?|Chandler, why are you doing this?
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.|Chandler.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?|Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?|Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.|Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.|Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.|Hey!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.|She's right y'know.
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.|Yeah, but still, cheap shot!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.|Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.
I didn't think I was!|Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?|No, I will not!
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.|You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.|Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.|Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.|Okay, how long is this going to go on.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.|Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.|This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole "We were on a break thing?" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.|That's not funny.
That's not funny at all!|Alicia Sky Varinaitis
That's not funny at all!|Gigi McCreery & Perry Rein
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey!
What are you guys doing up?|Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.|Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey, how about maroon?
Dark red.|
Aww, you guys are so cute!|I know.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.|Okay.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!|Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but…|Cat.
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.|I love you too.
Uhh, we still need a tip.|All right. Hold on.  How much more do we need?
A couple of bucks.|Okay, dime!  Oh my God, this is a police badge!
A couple of bucks.|Wow!
A couple of bucks.|Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts.  Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.|Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.|Hey, you guys!
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.|Hey!
Hey Joey!|Hey.
Hey Joey!|Hey. That uh, that my sweatshirt?
Hey Joey!|Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?
Hey Joey!|Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I’m not him.
Hey Joey!|I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.
Hey Joey!|No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!
Hey Joey!|Are you saying I smell bad?
Hey Joey!|No! No, you smell like a meadow.
Hey Joey!|What's with him?
Hey Joey!|Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.
Ugh!|"Come here to me!"
What?! You say that to kids?!!|No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.|You picked a great couch.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.|Yeah?
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.|Yeah. Could you just sign right here please?
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.|Oh, sure. Whoa-whoa, what's this? The delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!|Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you!
Yeah!  Are you kiddin'?|Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Oh. Oh! I can do it!|Yeah!
Oh. Oh! I can do it!|You two are really gonna enjoy that couch.
Oh. Oh! I can do it!|Oh yeah, we're uh, yeah we're not together.
Oh. Oh! I can do it!|Ohh, okay.
Ross!|What's that supposed to mean?
Ross!|Well you, her, I mean, she's very…y'know. And you're like…y'know.
Ross!|Not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.
Ross!|Really? You two?
Ross!|Yeah! Rach?
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.|Then tell him quickly.
We went out.|Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!|A loser you did it with  298 times!
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?|Yes?
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!|Yeah I can, it worked real well.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.|I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!|What?!
Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.|Who are you talking too?
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.|I am not going to apologize to a tree!
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.  Backup! Backup!!|I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Okay.|Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Okay, go left. Left! Left!|Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it!  Okay. You got it?|Yeah.
Good-good-good.|Oh-oh!
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?|Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
…so this guy was all  It was just so cool!|Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.|Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Hey.|Oh.
Hey.|Hi, Joe.
Hey.|Yeah, I didn’t know you guys were going to be here.
Hey.|Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this.
Hey.|What?! Why?!
Hey.|What is going on with you?
Hey.|Nothing!
Hey.|Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!
Hey.|All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,
Hey.|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I don’t want to talk about it.
Hey.|Well, it involved Monica.
Hey.|You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!
Hey.|Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish.
Hey.|What was the dream about?
Hey.|Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.
Hey.|Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn’t mean that-that you're in love with me!
Hey.|It-it doesn’t?
Hey.|No!
Hey.|No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.
Hey.|That kinda sounds like your dream dude.
Hey.|Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.
Hey.|In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.
Hey.|Um-hmm.
Hey.|Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?
Hey.|Not really.
Hey.|Well there you have it!
Hey.|Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!
Hey.|No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend! Yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crosswords, but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like-like you guys have?
Hey.|Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?
Hey.|Friends first? That's interesting.
Hey.|You become friends after?
Hey.|No, never done that either.
Hey.|Hey, umm, do you guys have that tape measure?
Hey.|Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom.
Hey.|That's right.
Hey.|What's up Joey?
Hey.|How you doin'?
Excuse me, is this your car?|Yeah.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.|Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.|So am I!
Ohh, no.|Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.|Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.|Who-who else is in vice up there?
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?|Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.|No, I don't know him.
Don’t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.|Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
I-I sure will, take care.|And where did you find my badge?
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?|Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off,  for you.
Thanks!|Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
I know.|Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
What's up Joe?|Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…
Yeah?|…is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…
What are you saying?|I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.|I'll treat you real nice.
Yeah, well, y'know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!|Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.|Yeah. I understand. I understand.  Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.|Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?|Well, I brought the next best thing.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?|Hey!
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!|Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.|Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Oh, that's me.|Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
No! That's-that's my arm!|Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.|Okay!
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.|Okay.
All right, ready?|Yeah.
Turn.|Okay.
Turn! Turn!|Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Turn! Turn!|Ross, I don't, I just don't think it's going to fit.
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!|Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.|You think?!
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.|Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I can't believe that didn't work!|I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
I can't believe that didn't work!|Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?
Hey!|Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.|Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed.|Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!|What?! Why?!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!|What about the closeness?
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!|Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?|Who is it?
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?|N.Y.P.D!!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?|Oh my God!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Ooh, God, it's him! It's that cop! God, I can't believe it! He found me!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Oh my God, Phoebe, are you gonna go to jail?!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Well, if I'm going down, I'm taking you  Okay, you can arrest me. Fine. But you'll never make it stick and you know it!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Yeah, but I kinda don't have a choice, it's my job. I mean, you understand right?
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Yep! As long as you understand that I'm going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he'll make you look like a fool. A fool!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|I don't like looking foolish. Y'know what? Maybe uh, I don't arrest you today. Maybe I came by and you weren't here.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|I would love it if I weren't here!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Okay, so since umm, you're not going to jail tonight I was wondering if you would like to go to dinner with me?
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Me?!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Yeah. Ever since you flashed my badge at me, I kinda can't stop thinking about you. You're the prettiest, fake undercover whore I've ever seen.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Nice!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Wow! I didn't see that coming! You're-you're asking me out!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Yeah. I mean, I coulda done it better, but these people keep staring at me.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Umm, yeah, I'd like to go out with you officer…
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Gary.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Gary.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Okay, so it's a date.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Yeah! So--ooh, I gotta ask you though. How did you know where to find me?
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Well you're fingerprints were all over my badge so I just ran it through the computer and this was listed as your last known address so I just checked it out.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Ohh, impressive.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Not as impressive as you. I gotta tell you, I looked at your record and you've done some pretty weird stuff.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Yeah, we'll talk at dinner.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Okay.  So I'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|All right, I can't wait!
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|Okay. And don't worry, I'm not just gonna take you out for donuts.
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|He has a gun!
You wanna return this couch?  It's cut in half!|That's what I'm telling you.
Did you cut this couch in half?|This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!|Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.|I take it.
Good, you guys are all here!|Hey! What's up?
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!|Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
I know!|Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Wh-what?!|I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!|Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Yeah.|You wanna work on your interview skills?
O-okay!|Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Hi.|Very good handshake, good wrist action.
Hi.|Let me try.
Hi.|Okay.
Hi.|Did I squeeze it too hard?
Hi.|Let's just say, I'm glad I'm not Chandler.
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday,  same as the day before.|Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.|Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that.  Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor…|Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?|This is your place?
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.|But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Ugh!!|What happened?
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.|No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.|Okay, now I've really have to go!
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.|But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.|I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.|Okay, then maybe I can come too!
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|All right, you go.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|Bye-bye.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|'Kay, bye!
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|Oh God!
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|What?
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|Oh I just miss him so much!
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|I know it is the best.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|What? It's still going on.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|Come on, seriously! When did it end?
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don’t you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|I was wrong obviously, I just—I misspoke. It's okay.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|You are so cute.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?|Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?|Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?|No!
So what happened?|Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!"  Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
So what happened?|What happened?
So what happened?|
So what happened?|You kissed him?!
So what happened?|Well, I didn't know what else to do!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|Thanks Chandler.
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|Yes!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|Yeah!  No?
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|A kiss? What are you talking about?
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
Come on, Rach.|Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Come on, Rach.|He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
Come on, Rach.|Maybe. I-I don't know—Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
Come on, Rach.|Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on.  She's back! Hot girl's back!
Come on, Rach.|Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.
Come on, Rach.|No, in Ross's building!
Damnit!! Did you move?!|Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place.  I'm Ross.
Damnit!! Did you move?!|Yes?
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?|No. I'm all alone.
Yeah. Sorry about that.  Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?|Daddy!!
Hi Rachel!|Hi!
It's really nice to see you again.|Thank you.
|What?
Just ah…|Excuse me?
Here let me…|
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?|You got ink on your lip.
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?|I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|Phoebe, do you want to go see a movie after dinner tonight?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|Oh we can't, we already have plans.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|What are you doing?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|Yeah!
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|Okay.  Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
Uh, yeah.|Okay.  We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Why?|'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Ohh, so?|So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Hey!|You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.|I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Nevermind!|No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…|Jen.
Jen, I know this may sound a little… But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…|Sure! That would be nice.
Umm?|Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.
I will give you a call.|I'll see you later.
Okay!|I forgot my paper.
That was amazing!|Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.|We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
No, you're the best.|No, you're the best.
No, you're the best.|I am the best.
No, you're the best.|
No, you're the best.|Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
No, you're the best.|I don't know. But I can see through your sheet.  Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
No, you're the best.|Why?
No, you're the best.|Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
No, you're the best.|What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
No, you're the best.|No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
No, you're the best.|No, those first two windows,  that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
No, you're the best.|I did not know that! Thank you Monica.  I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
So uhh, you ready?|Sure, I'll just get my coat.  Could you get that?
Sure.  Joey…|Dahhhhh!!
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.|That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.|Fair enough.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr…|Zelner.
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.|Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Oh! You are?|Um-hmm.
Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?|Yes!
You tired Chandler?|You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
You tired Chandler?|Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
You tired Chandler?|So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
You tired Chandler?|Oh yeah, it's so cool.
You tired Chandler?|Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.|Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so…
Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.|You didn't!
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!|The park huh? A public place.
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!|Uh-huh.
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!|I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
Hi Chandler.|Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it?
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?|No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Come on, we can't let them win!|Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!|So?
I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.|Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?|Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Really?|Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.|Yeah?
Yeah.|Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Did not.|Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Okay, I freaked out a little.|Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!  And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!|Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!|You guys ready fore the movies?
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.|
Okay, pick a card.|Okay.
All right now, memorize it.  You got it?|Oh yes.
|Yes.
|Hey guys!
|Hi!
|Hi there!
|Hi!!
|Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
|What are you talking about?!
|Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.|I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!|That.
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!|Luck!
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!|Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…|Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…|Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Good luck! Go get 'em!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Okay!!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Done.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|I would love to do it together!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|They're gonna do it together.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Dude! That's my girlfriend!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|What, so I gotta shut it down now?
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Yeah.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|You're not his godfather.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|What?! Are you kidding?!
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Okay, let's go godfather.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|All right!
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!|Really? That's great!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…|Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….|Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?|Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do!|Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?|Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.|She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.|Oh, what a fun office.
Rachel? Do you smoke?|Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!|That doesn't seem fair.
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!|Yeah, it is the best.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?|Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, I can do that.|Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
Yeah, I can do that.|Hey!
Yeah, I can do that.|Hey!
Yeah, I can do that.|Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
I would love to!|Oh good!
I would love to!|Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
I would love to!|Oh good.
I would love to!|Oh wait, I change my mind!
I would love to!|Yeah, me too!
I would love to!|Oh, look at that.
I would love to!|All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
I would love to!|What happened to the intimate dinner party?
I would love to!|Oh, we're not doing that. Okay…
I would love to!|So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
I would love to!|What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
I would love to!|Like what?
I would love to!|Cups.
I would love to!|Cups? You're giving me cups?
I would love to!|And ice!
I would love to!|Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?  All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
I would love to!|Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant…
I would love to!|I got it! Mine!
I would love to!|Hi.
I would love to!|Hey! How'd the audition go?!
I would love to!|Not so good.
I would love to!|Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's  Yeah it did?"
I would love to!|Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
I would love to!|Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
I would love to!|You got a callback too didn't you?
I would love to!|Yeah I did!
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?|Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.|Oh great!
So anyway we really…  Honey, we're just smoking all over you.|Oh, sorry!
So anyway we really…  Honey, we're just smoking all over you.|Oh that's okay.
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.|So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Oh that's great! You are the best!|Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
Oh that's great! You are the best!|I thought you didn't smoke.
Oh that's great! You are the best!|Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
We get high.|Oh, me too.
I'm kidding.|Oh, me too.
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?|Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?|Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?|Who knows?
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?|Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!|Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Yeah!|Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two
Yeah!|Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
Yeah, it is.|Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.|Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Hey!|Hi!
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?|Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Umm, cups.|Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Umm, cups.|Seriously that's a lot of cups.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.|Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Hey Pheebs!  Hey!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Hey!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|What's up?
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Well, you just…
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|What?!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|At least I care about his feelings!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|What?!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn’t get it?
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|And why wouldn't he get it?
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|You just give him a spoon baby!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|You're kid's name is Raymond!
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Yeah?! So's yours!
How did work go?|Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
You stink!|Thanks!
No, I'm-I'm serious!|Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
No, I'm-I'm serious!|Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
No, I'm-I'm serious!|I did not!
No, I'm-I'm serious!|Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
No, I'm-I'm serious!|All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
No, I'm-I'm serious!|I wish I had smoked for my career…
That's so gross!|No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
That's so gross!|Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.|I think you smell great!
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?|Absolutely!
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?|I am so on board!
Rachel didn't you just light that?|Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
Rachel didn't you just light that?|I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like|Tell me about it!
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like|Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
It does sound appealing.|Oh, I never could do it.
It does sound appealing.|Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!|Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.|Okay then!
Hmmm, soup!  Hmm, soup!|Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Oh yeah, no problem.|Thanks.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.|Joey!
Ross!|I mean, Ben! Ben!
Ross!|Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.
Hi!|Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Uh-oh.|Is there a problem?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.|Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?|Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!|All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.|Okay. Let's do it again.
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!|COME ON!!!!
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!|Y'know what? We need to move on.
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!|Uh-oh, busted!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!|Yeah. That didn't work out.
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!|Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?|No. No! You're doing great! Don’t you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.|Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Okay.|So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
|Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
|Why don't you just go out with her!
Ahhh! Mystical!|Awesome!
Ahhh! Mystical!|Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
Ahhh! Mystical!|There are snow cones!  Snow cones! Yuck!
Ahhh! Mystical!|Y'know…go! Go! Right there!
Ahhh! Mystical!|Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, look! Look! Look!|Surprise!!
Oh, look! Look! Look!|What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
Oh, look! Look! Look!|That's the surprise!
Oh, look! Look! Look!|Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
Oh, look! Look! Look!|Surprise!
Oh, look! Look! Look!|Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
I was in charge of cups.|Oh, okay, not so weird.
Hey!|Hey.
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.|Yeah right!
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!|Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.|What you do mean?
I think, sub-consciously…|Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.|Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…
No!|No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
There you go. Thank you!|Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
No.|Eh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.|Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Okay, great.|
Hey!|Hey!
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?|Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Hi Chandler!
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Ugh, I hate it! I look like an 8-year-old boy.
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting.
Wow! How'd you get in there?|It's uh, 27 dollars even.
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Oh, okay.  Here you go.
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Hey, where's the chicken?
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first.
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Great. I'll see you later!
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Okay, bye!
What the hell was that?!|What?
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!|I was not flirting.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "|Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Yeah, right.|You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!|I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.|Don't get me started on that.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.|I was not flirting.
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.|And on your anniversary, for shame!
What's going on?|Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
What's going on?|I was not and oh God, shh!
What's going on?|Well I'm sorry but you were! Okay? And besides if anyone should be hitting on her it's the guy who's single, the guy that who-who-who can do something about it.
What's going on?|Sounds like somebody wants to be Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.
What's going on?|Well…
What's going on?|Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.|Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Hm-mmm.|And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.|Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.|This is perfect! She'll have to come back here with your pizza, and when she does, I'll turn on the Charm-O-Ross. Oh I'm so glad you don't eat meat.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.|See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.|Hey everybody, look who's here! You remember my grandmother!
Big night!|This is so cool!
Big night!|So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!
Big night!|Chandler, she doesn't understand a word of English.

Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.|Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.|These are her earrings.
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!|Why not?
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|Rach? What are you doing?
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|Oh boy, I just can't watch. It's too scary!

Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|Thank you for that!  I was not flirting.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|It's okay. I don't care. It's uh, it's fine.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|Really?!
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|Really?!
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|It's no big deal, I do it all the time.
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|So umm, you-you flirt with guys all the time?
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|Sure! It doesn't mean anything! Just like I know it doesn't mean anything with you!
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am.
|Chandler, this actually bothers you?
|Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?
|Uhh, no, no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.
|And thank you, for that.
|But y'know, I never really had anything to worry about. Ross was never very good at the flirting thing.
|What?  What-what, what are talking about? It-it worked with you.
|Oh! Y'know what? You're right! We meet, you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me!
|All right, all right. You-you-you know what I'm going to do? I am going to order another pizza and when Caitlin gets here, you-you--I will show how well I flirt. Yeah! I will, I will get her phone number!  And not the one on the menu!
|I found it!
|Ohh! Thank God! Where was it?
|On your dresser.
|Okay that is the one we already have!
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here!  Oh my God.|What?
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.|Well, what is it?
Oh, they cut me out of the show.|What?!
Oh, they cut me out of the show.|Are you sure?
Oh, they cut me out of the show.|Maybe your scene's coming up?
Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there|Yeah.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?|I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
That's not good.|
That's not good.|Joey, why don't you just tell her what happened? It's not your fault.
That's not good.|If we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?
That's not good.|
That's not good.|Soon, soon, I'm gonna be on soon. There I am!
That's not good.|No! Sam Waterston!
That's not good.|No-no-no, that-that's me, that's me.
That's not good.|No, it's Sam Waterston! Crimes and Misdemeanors, Capricorn One.
That's not good.|Doesn't know, "Hello." But she knows Capricorn One.
That's not good.|Phoebe! I have to have those earrings, we're going to leave as soon as the show is over.
But I already gave them back to you!|No you didn't.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.  Where is that other earring?|It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.|Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!|Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Why are you being weird?|Do you like it?
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"|Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?|Yeah, it's good.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!|Chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.|Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"|No way!
It's true.|Well that's pathetic!
Again true.|And this goes for all guys?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.|All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.|Joey! This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.|I know, I know! What am I going to do?  Ooh!
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.|No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.|
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.|Joey!
Hey!|Did you find it?
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.|Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Okay, calm down, here they are.|
Okay, calm down, here they are.|What are we going to do?!
I don't know, I don't know.|All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.|I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Ohh that'd be great!|Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Ohh that'd be great!|Yeah, what is it?
Ohh that'd be great!|Umm, I lost one of your earrings. I'm sorry! I am so, so sorry!
Ohh that'd be great!|Wow! All right well, I mean, what can you do? If you lost it you lost it.
Ohh that'd be great!|I will replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.
Ohh that'd be great!|All right, sweetie that's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.
Ohh that'd be great!|No.
Ohh that'd be great!|Look at you! Come here!  Feel better?
Ohh that'd be great!|Yeah! You're the best!
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.|Okay?!

Hey! What's up?!|I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
So all we have is ice?|See if he has ice.
Okay.|I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
So where are we going next?|This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
So where are we going next?|Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
So where are we going next?|Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
So where are we going next?|It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
Yeah, no one talks like that!|Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!|How do you figure that?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!|Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Umm, jealous!|Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Yeah, no problem.|Ross!
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.|Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|Nooo!
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|I know!
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|What?! We can't do that!
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn’t give us the right to erase his message!
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn’t that give me the right to control him—help him?
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|I don't think he's the one who needs help.
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.  Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|Ugh!
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|Your messages have been erased.
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|Noooooooo!
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!|No. But that reminds me,  sign this.
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!|What is it?
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!|Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.|Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.|What? What? What? What is it?
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.|Is everything okay?
What's going on?|Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
What's going on?|Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.  Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
What's going on?|You okay man?
What's going on?|Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
Uh, HELLO!!|Hi.
All right, I guess we should go.|No, wait. Wait.
Oh yeah right!|No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!|Yeah well unless we tell him.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.|Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.|
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!|Right?
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?|John Glenn is here?!
No, Joey!|Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…
Wait! Hold on!  Hi!|Hi!
Okay, go ahead.|Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Okay, go ahead.|My God, Joey!
Okay, go ahead.|It was a car backfire!
Okay, go ahead.|Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
Okay, go ahead.|Yeah, I didn't know that.
Okay, go ahead.|And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.|Who jumps at loud noises!
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.|Wow! I could've died tonight.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.|Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.|I do have a newfound respect for life.
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.|
So you wanna get some dinner?|Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.|Okay!
All right.|Bye!
All right.|Bye!
All right.|Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Dude! How come you took off?|Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…
Is something wrong?|No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Okay.|You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!|I do not hate Ross!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.|What picture?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!|Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!|When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.|From a bullet!
I know it doesn't make much sense…|Much sense?!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!|So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!|So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!|Really?!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.|Thanks.
How good is that?|Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
See?|Hm-hmm.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!|I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Hey! Hi!|Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!|Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?|The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
What?! What? What happened?!|Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Yeah!|And somebody took a shot at me!
Really?!|No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Because a car backfired?|Okay, why are you here?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.|You talked to her?
No, she left a message.  something wrong with your machine.|Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.|Wow!
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?|Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.  Your decision.|Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?|Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!|You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.|Huh.
I mean, look-look today you escaped  death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?|That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Well, there you go!|Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Close call day.|Hey, thanks Rach.
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.|Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Oh?|Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
No.|Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Yeah.|Yeah, I want my money back.
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?|Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.|Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.|Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.|Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.|Yeah, hero sandwiches.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.|Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way.  Not you Joey.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.|Greg Malins
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.|Scott Silveri
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?|I'm fine, thanks.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?|Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?|No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?|Okay.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?|Hiya doin' pumpkin?
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?|Nope.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?|I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Oh my God!|What do you, what do you think?
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?|Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…|
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…|Okay. Bye!
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…|So, what movie should we see?
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!|What?! Really?!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!|I can't believe this!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!|Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!|Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!|No, but it is fast. Isn't it?
Ohhhh!|No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
Ohhhh!|So, what are you gonna do?
Ohhhh!|I don't know. I'll just handle it—I'll ask you to talk to him!
Ohhhh!|Me?! Why me?
Ohhhh!|Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a…man!
Ohhhh!|I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.
That is so sweet!|
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?|Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.|Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?|2:17.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?|Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.|Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!|Hey, you guys…
Hey!|Is Monica here?
Hey!|No.
Hey!|All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.
Hey!|You bought Shawn Cassidy!
Hey!|Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?
Hey!|Yeah!
Hey!|Okay!  Check it out!
Hey!|What-what is it?!
What the hell is that?!!|It's a, it's a cat!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}|Yes it is!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}|Why is it inside out?!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}|Excuse me! But this is a purebred, show-quality Sphinx cat!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}|How much did you pay for that?
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}|Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}|Yeah? How much?
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}|A thousand bucks.
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}|ON A CAT??!!!!
It's not a cat!|All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
It's not a cat!|Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}
It's not a cat!|Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson.  Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!
It's not a cat!|Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?
Uhh, the ball thing.|Yeah?
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!|Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Uh-oh.|What?
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!|I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?|Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.|Yeah?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.|What's up?
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.|Sure. Okay.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!|Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
You mean scared.|No, I mean happy.
Scared? Happy?|Chandler, what-what are you doing?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!|I know! I can't wait!
Were you're parents happy, or something?|Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.|So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!|No, it's too soon for you guys.
…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!|Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!|Hey guys!
…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!|Hi!
…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!|Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night.  It was right here, where is it?
…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!|I don't know.
…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!|All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!
How do you know? You don't have a watch.|Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
How do you know? You don't have a watch.|Oh, I don't know…. Yeah, can't do it.
How do you know? You don't have a watch.|What?!
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!|Yeah, we haven't dropped it in…
2 hours, 27 minutes.|Really?!
|Hey Rach!
|Hey.
|Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!
|Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.
Rach?|Yeah?
You have scratches all over you, what happened?|Well, it's my cat.
What?!|Oh yeah, I got a cat.
I don't want a cat!|Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
I don't want a cat!|Yeah.
I don't want a cat!|You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, "Rachel!"
I don't want a cat!|Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!|Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Hi!|Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.|What?!
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.|You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
I’m sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.|Ohh!! God!  Get out of here, good for nothing.
I’m sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.|Hey Chandler.
Hey Gar!|Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Hey Gar!|Yeah! Okay.
Hey Gar!|You look very pretty today.
Hey Gar!|Thanks! Okay.
Hey Gar!|Here's the thing.
Hey Gar!|Yeah?
Hey Gar!|Y'know I really want to move this relationship forward.
Hey Gar!|Uh-hmm.
Hey Gar!|Because if you're not moving forward, y'know you're just moving backwards.
Hey Gar!|No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.
Hey Gar!|Phoebe?
Hey Gar!|Yeah?
Hey Gar!|I want you to move in with me.
Hey Gar!|That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.
Hey Gar!|Oh. Oh-oh-okay, I get it.
Hey Gar!|I just—I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.
Hey Gar!|Uh-huh.
Hey Gar!|I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just—I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.
Hey Gar!|Yeah.
Hey Gar!|Which is why my answer is yes!
Hey Gar!|Really?!
Hey Gar!|Uh-huh!
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!|Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!|That's right baby.
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!|All right, let me in.
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!|No-no! Don't do it! Don't!
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!|What?
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!|He's a dropper!
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!|Oh yeah, that's right!
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!|I'm not a dropper!
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?|It's throwing and catching!
All right.|Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
All right.|Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!
All right.|Oh my—Oh good God!
All right.|I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Baking it didn't help, huh?|I tried! They won't take her back.
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Rach, why won't they take it back?
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Well, they said would but they would only give me store credit. I mean, what am I going to do, get a thousand regular cats?
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Look, if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it.
Baking it didn't help, huh?|No Mon that's not the point. I'm out a thousand dollars, I'm all scratched up, and I'm stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Oh my God, the cat's made my eyes water! Don't-don't throw it to me! My vision's been compromised!!  Oh God! Okay. Okay. It's okay. Man, that was close.
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Yeah, you almost overreacted to something.
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Hey!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Hey!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|We have great news!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|We're moving in together! Isn't it great! Yay!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Congratulations! Congrats!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|I know, I'm so excited!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|So am I!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Well, you're not more excited than I am! No way! I'm the most excited!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Okay, I'll see you at the station later.
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Okay, yeah, I'll see you later! Don't forget about the moving in!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|All right.
Baking it didn't help, huh?|So you're moving in with him. What happened?
Baking it didn't help, huh?|I couldn't tell him no. He got so sad. Maybe it'll be all right. I do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus, think of all the money I'll save on stamps.
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Why, do you write him a lot?
Baking it didn't help, huh?|No, I just heard when people live together, they split the cost of stamps. Don't they?
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Yeah! That's right. Yeah-yeah! Yeah!
Baking it didn't help, huh?|Oh, I'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?|No, nothing.
Oh really?|Yeah.
Nothing at all?|No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?|Uh-huh!
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?|Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?|Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.  Can I get some water?
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?|Umm, yeah! Today's.
'Cause uh, this is today's Post  Brooklyn Heights!|Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Let me tell you what I think might be going on.  Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?|Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts!
Phoebe…|Yeah?
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.|That's so sweet.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just—I want you to be happy|Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.|No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Are you sure?|Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Oh that's great!|Oh wait, one sec. One sec.  which was never!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!|Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
It's not a baby! It's a cat!|Eew! It's creepy looking!
Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!  Yeah, do you want it?|No, I hate cats.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!|Wow! What an unusual cat!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?|Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter  but… Okay, why not?
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.|What?!
Okay, a thousand.|I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.|Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
I'm starving!|Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
I'm starving!|I don't know who made you the boss? All right? We  invented this game!
I'm starving!|Please! I made this game what it is.
I'm starving!|Not fun anymore?
I'm still hungry!|All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
I am!|All right! Let's go!  All right, we can work out the name later.

That would be great!|We could have breakfast in bed…
Wait, just a second.|Okay.  Oh! Oh no.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|Oh good, you're all up.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|Phoebe! It's 6 o'clock in the morning! Why aren't you at Gary's?
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|Oh yeah, that's over.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|What?!
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|He shot a bird!
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|Oh that is over!
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|That's terrible! I'm sorry!
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|Phoebe, are you okay?
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|Yeah. Yeah, I'll be alright.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|Oh hey, here Pheebs.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!|All right. Okay. I'm starving!

Oh hey Joey! What's up?|I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Yeah, I've been around.|Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}|Great! Problem solved!
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.|Well, back to square one.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.|Yes!
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind.  Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?|Peanut butter!
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?|A swimmer!
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?|Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?|Ascot!
North route or south route?|North route!
Bamn! There you go! Huh?|Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Bamn! There you go! Huh?|Hey!
Oh, this guy again.|Hey man, what's up?
Oh, this guy again.|Uhh, not much. You guys want to see a movie tonight?
Oh, this guy again.|Sure, what do you want to see?
Oh, this guy again.|I don't know, umm…
Oh, this guy again.|Oh, I know how we can decide. Phoebe, show him your game!
Umm, no thank you.|What's with her?
Umm, no thank you.|I don't know. But hey, I know we can decide. Okay, I'm gonna ask you questions and you answer real quick. Okay?
Umm, no thank you.|Okay.
Umm, no thank you.|What do you like better action or comedy?
Umm, no thank you.|Action.
Umm, no thank you.|Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?
Umm, no thank you.|Dude, you are sick.
Umm, no thank you.|Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.
Oh my God! What does that thing do?|Oh that's an eye removal machine.
All right, I'm outta here!|I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
All right, I'm outta here!|Hi Rachel!
Hey!|I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
So were done then!|Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Okay.|This is a glaucoma test.
Uh-huh.|Sit down.
Okay.|But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
What?!|A small puff of air, now come on!
What?!|Here we go.
All right.|1…2…3!
I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time.  Okay.|Ready?
Uh-huh.|1…2…
Uh-huh.|Y'know what, I'm gonna hold her head.
Okay.|That's okay.
Okay.|Okay.
Okay. Okay!|1…2!  Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
|Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.|Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Great!|And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!|Dr. Miller?  P E C F D.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!|Very good Monica! You know where they are.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!|I sure do!  And you don't get one!
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.|They're still in my coat.
Damn!|Hey!
Damn!|Hey! You ready to go?
Damn!|Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
Damn!|What?
Damn!|I love you.
Damn!|Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
Damn!|Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
Damn!|Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
Damn!|Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
Damn!|I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
Damn!|Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
Damn!|So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
Damn!|Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!
Damn!|Hey!
Damn!|Hey!
Damn!|I just wanna say good-bye to you guys and to see if you guys will place a little bet for me, huh? Twenty bucks on black 15.

Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.|Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.|Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!|All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!|All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Fine!  Get out!|You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Get out!!|All right!!  Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?|No.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?|No that made me feel precious.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?|Oh, I know! Umm, is it because he's always correcting people's grammar? Whom! Whom! Sometimes it's who!
Yeah? Sometimes it's…|Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Okay, I'm the baby.|Eh! Stop it!

Hey!|Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Hey!|Why?!
Hey!|I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
Hey!|That game should not be played without my supervision.
Hey!|Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
Hey!|What's in the bag?
Hey!|Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road.  Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?

Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!|I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!|Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!|What did you do to his sweater vests?
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!|Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!|Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
Hey, dude!|Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Oh that's my grandma.|Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering…  Okay, I guess he ran out of change.|Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering…  Okay, I guess he ran out of change.|Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering…  Okay, I guess he ran out of change.|That's a good idea. I wonder where I could  get a basket of porn…
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!|Really?
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.|Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Uh-hmm.|What do you like better flora or fauna?
Fauna.|Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Garfunkle.|Why are you mad at me?
You said I was boring--Ohh!|When did I say you were boring?!

Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.|Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Wh-what?! Why?!|It's a money thing, we don't have any.
You're kidding right?|No.
What?!|It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Uh, hang out?! How long?|I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?

Sucker!|Hey Joey!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?|Sure! Where is it?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.|Ohh! So you're 5639?!
Hey!|Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
No!  Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!|Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Who was that?|Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Who was that?|Y'know what? I have been trying to apologize to him all week! If he's not gonna let me do it on the phone, I'm gonna go down there and do it in person.
Yeah!|Hey!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!|Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late!|Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?|Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Which Richard?|The Richard.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!|Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?|It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.|Really?
But again, Simmons. Go on.|The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?|Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!|I know.
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!|What?
On a totally different bet.|Hey!

Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.|Do we have to?
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.|No.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.|Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.|Oh, he just doesn't want us to go through any trouble. Think of how excited he'll be when we go out and surprise him! Plus we get to have our own, ani-Vegas-ary! A-Nevadaversary!
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.|Yeah, I think we should see other people.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.|But we can go, right?
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.|Yes.
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.|Okay!

Hey!|Hey!
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!|Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|Oh, but I've got tickets to the Van Gogh exhibit! I've been waiting like a year for this.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|Art lover!
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|What'd you say?
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|I said art lover.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|Is that supposed to be an insult?
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|I don't know, I'm very tired.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|So Rach, maybe you and I could fly out together Saturday.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|That sounds great.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|Yeah? All right I'll call the airlines.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|Okay. Yeah, that would be nice actually, to have the apartment to myself for a night.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.|No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.|No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?|So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?|Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Ah-ha! Okay,|Happy plane-aversary.
Ah-ha! Okay,|Aww! I love you!
Ah-ha! Okay,|Can I give you a present now?
Ah-ha! Okay,|Okay!
Ah-ha! Okay,|Okay!  Oh man! Don’t tell me I did this!
Ah-ha! Okay,|I love the "I forgot the present" fake out!
Ah-ha! Okay,|How do you feel about the, "I really did forgot the present, please forgive me" not fake out?
Ah-ha! Okay,|Oh that's okay. Don’t worry about it, you can give it to me when we get back.
Ah-ha! Okay,|Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.|What-what Richard thing?
Oh no. [The patented version.]|What Richard thing?
Simmons! Go with Simmons!|Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!|I'm not mad.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!|Really?!
Simmons! Go with Simmons!|Oh yeah! Yeah, so you-you bumped into Richard! You grabbed a bite! It's no big deal.
Simmons! Go with Simmons!|Great!

Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?|Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.|Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
No! No!|Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?|Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.|Yes.
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.|Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Hey you guys wait! Guys!  This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!|Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
For 99 cents, I'd eat you.  Oh! Look! Hi!|Oh my God.
Hey! Joey!|Hi!
Hey! Joey!|Love your condoms my man.
Hey! Joey!|What-what are you guys doing here? I thought I told you not to come.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second.  Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|Who are you talking too?
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|They uh director. Uhh, her.  All right, all right, it's not a gladiator movie. I work here.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|Why?! What happened?!
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|Well, the movie got shutdown because they ran out of money, so I'm working here 'til it starts up again, if it ever does.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|I'm so sorry.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell ya.  I'm sorry man.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody.
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|I knew you were not okay with that.
So you're a gladiator! Wow!|Yeah, what-what's going on?
Monica had lunch with Richard.|Dawson?!
Noo! But that would've been so cool!|No! Her boyfriend Richard!
Noo! But that would've been so cool!|It meant nothing! Okay? After all this time, how can you not trust me?
Noo! But that would've been so cool!|When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
Noo! But that would've been so cool!|You're right. I'm sorry. I should've told you.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!|Thanks.
Noo! But that would've been so cool!|Aww, there we go.
I love Vegas!|I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
I love Vegas!|Next time?
I love Vegas!|Ooh, so close.
I love Vegas!|There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
I love Vegas!|I can not see him? I mean, you can't tell me what to do!
I love Vegas!|That's so funny, because I think I just did!
I love Vegas!|Oh y'know what? If you're gonna be acting like this all night, I really, I don't even want to be around you.
I love Vegas!|Fine with me!
I love Vegas!|Fine! Happy Anniversary!
I love Vegas!|Whoa! Whoa! Guys! Please! Come on! Come on! This is obviously just a big misunderstanding.
I love Vegas!|No it is not!
I love Vegas!|What are you talking…
I love Vegas!|Hey-hey don't look at me! I just work here!
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.|Yep! That's hilarious!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.|Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.|Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.|What?! You totally get embarrassed!
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.|Is that so?
Yeah.|
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.|Really?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…|Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.|Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!|Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!|Good luck!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!|I see.
Thank you.|Thanks.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!|Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am so sorry.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.|So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!|Sure!  Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Anybody lose this?|Comin' out. Place your bet.
|Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
|Ross! What are you… I'm sorry sir. I just, I think he just really likes you.
What the? What…|Hi!
What the? What…|Miss? May I help you?
What the? What…|Yes, I'm sorry. Do you have any extra pants? Umm, my friend seems to have had a little accident.
|Changing one hundred!  Good luck sir.
Let's ride.|13.
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!|What?
My identical hand twin!|What's an identical hand twin?
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!|Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!|How?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!|Again I must go back to, how?
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand  twice? Huh?|Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?|No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?|Hey!

I found my identical hand twin!|No!
I found my identical hand twin!|But she just came up here!
I found my identical hand twin!|That was Joey!
I found my identical hand twin!|I wonder where she is. That is so weird.
I found my identical hand twin!|Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard.
I found my identical hand twin!|Would you stop that! Do you wanna know the first thing she said when she came back from her lunch with Richard? She didn't feel anything for him. She loves you!
I found my identical hand twin!|Really?
I found my identical hand twin!|Yes! Now, she feels terrible! She really wants to make up! You gotta find her.
I found my identical hand twin!|Okay.
I found my identical hand twin!|Good.  I should really start wearing hats!

Hey, you wet my pants!|Ross, I have been walking around like this since the plane! I can—you have so crossed a line.
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.|Ugh!

Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.|M-M-Mole people?
What? No-no, a lurker.|Oh. What's a lurker?
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then…|Kills you?
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.|Ohhh!
Uh-hmm.|How do you know about this?
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.|Dance karate?
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.|All right, it won't come off!
What?!|It won't come off!
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?|No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.

What?! That's not gonna make you any money!|Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
All right baby, come on!  Yes! Yes! I am on fire!|See you later Mon.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!|What does it look like? I'm going home.
What? Wait! Why?  Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!|Come on! I was there!  I know he's the love of your life.
Not any more.|Really?!
Really!  Okay, this is empty.|Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?|Which guy?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this.  See?|I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Okay!  How you doin'?|Very busy.
Yeah, it's not coming off.|What?! What else did he say?
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So… Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.|Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.|Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.|Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff.  That is, one big drink!|Macadamia nut?

Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!|
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|What are you guys doing here?
Hey!|Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn’t that why you guys are here?
Yes! Well that-yes.|Why else would we be here?
Yes! Well that-yes.|Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
We actually missed it.|Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you  run in the chapel!
We actually missed it.|This is insane!
We actually missed it.|What’s the big deal, y’know? It’s not like it’s a real marriage.
What?!|Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas.
What?!|What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you’re married everywhere.
What?!|Really?!
What?!|Yeah!
What?!|Oh my God!—Eh! Well…
Ohhh!|Why are we in bed together?
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?|Yeah.
Really?!|No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.|And we didn’t have sex.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.|
Mornin’ Pheebs.  Well, my movie has officially been canceled.|Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?|What about my cab?
I don’t need that anymore.|No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.  Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?|I don’t know, it’s such a long trip.
It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.|Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Sure?|All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
Sure?|Hi!
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
Hey.|Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!|It’s a buffet man.
Oh, here’s where I win all my money back!|Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Sure! What’s up?|Monica and I almost got married last night.
Oh my God! That’s huge!  Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."|Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.|What?!
How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.|Well you don’t.
Yes I do!|Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Yes I do!|Hi.
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|Hey!
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|Hey!
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|Hey!
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|What?
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or…
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|Yeah!
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|You did.
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|What?! Hello! We didn’t get married.
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|No, we didn’t get married! That’s ridiculous!
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|We-we-we—I remember being in a chapel.
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|Oh my God.
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|I—They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|No!
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|They let you get married when you’re drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|Hell, I’m drunk right now!  What? I can’t have a mimosa with breakfast?! I’m on vacation!
What are you guys gonna do?|Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
What are you guys gonna do?|Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one’s free.
What are you guys gonna do?|Laugh it up, but the joke’s on you. Because we don’t need to get divorced, okay? We we’re just gonna get an annulment.
What are you guys gonna do?|An annulment? Ross! I don’t think surgery’s the answer here.
What are you guys gonna do?|Oh-oh, that’s your thing.
What are you guys gonna do?|What?
What are you guys gonna do?|You’re thing. You’re thing. Y’know? You’re the guy who gets divorced.
What are you guys gonna do?|Oh yeah!
What are you guys gonna do?|No-no, that’s-that’s not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
What are you guys gonna do?|Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you’re probably gonna marry it! Then it won’t work out and you’re gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.  I’m so drunk.
So, what do you think we should do?|I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
I know I love you!|So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!|Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.|Sounds great.
Okay.|Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Ready?|Ready!
Come on eight.|Yes, yes eight.
Come on eight.|Eight! Easy eight.
Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.|That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.
Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.|That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack?|Yeah.  We’re doing the right thing, right?
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  QUESTIONS!!!|What?!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!|All right. All right.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.|Really? I don’t…
Sing!!|
Hey!|Hey, hubby!
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?|Uh-huh.
Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.|Yes, exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!|Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.
Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.|I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!|Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!
Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.|I’m asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!|And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.|Well you did pull his hair.
He took my snack!|I’m not getting into this again!
Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.|Well, I told you not to walk. Here.
This doesn’t mean anything, does it?|No!
, a rapist or a killer or something!|Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!|No!
Do you like car games?|Yeah, y’know the license plate game?
I love the license plate game!|Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!
Hey!|Hey!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married.  We register, and you get to keep all the presents!|No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
I don’t know if it’s true.|Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...|Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
All right. All right, I’ll do it.|Thank you.  Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!|Oh, okay.
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.|And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.
All right, see ya Pheebs.|Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh?  Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
All right, see ya Pheebs.|Stop it! Stop it no! That’s not fair! Y’know I can’t resist that beautiful voice!
All right, see ya Pheebs.|Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn’t deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
All right, see ya Pheebs.|You can still sleep at night and stuff.
All right, see ya Pheebs.|Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I’ve got a really good one! I’ve been thinking about it since Kansas.
All right, see ya Pheebs.|Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
All right, see ya Pheebs.|Yes.
All right, see ya Pheebs.|Is it a meatball sub?
All right, see ya Pheebs.|That is incredible! You are the master!

All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.|Well, what if all my stuff was here?
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.|Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.|Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I’m saying?
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.|Live together? There have been no signs for that.
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.|Me asking is kind of a sign.

Hey!|Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.|Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh yeah, why not?|Pheebs?
Oh yeah, why not?|No thanks, I’ve already seen one.
Oh yeah, why not?|Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater.
Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?|Always.
I didn’t get the annulment.|What?!
What are you doing?|The key’s stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on.|It still doesn’t work.
I’m not finished.|Oh.
I’m not finished.|Nice job Joe! You’re quite the craftsmen.
Hey!|Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.|Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh yeah, why not?|Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater.
Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?|Always.
I didn’t get the annulment.|What?!
Hey, do you have any gum?|Oh? Yeah! Sure!
Hey, do you have any gum?|Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
Hey, do you have any gum?|Oh but Phoebe, we’re gonna be late for the movie.
Hey, do you have any gum?|Oh, there’s a cab! Taxi!!
Hey, do you have any gum?|Yeah, we’re, we’re actually just gonna walk ‘cause it’s right up there at the Angelica.
Hey, do you have any gum?|Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go!  You didn’t get the annulment?!!
I know.|Ross?!
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.|Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!|So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry.
Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?|Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?|Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?|Hey Rach!
Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?|What was that?!
Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?|Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?|I haven’t seen it yet!
Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?|Well then you’d better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?|Noooooooo!!
Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?|Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?
No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.|Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?
No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too…" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "…go to the bathroom." He may think I’m sick.|Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.
Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?|Pretty much.
All right.|Hey Monica!
All right.|Hi!
All right.|
All right.|Joey, we have something to tell you.
All right.|Oh my God! You’re pregnant!
No-o-o!  No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man.|Wow!
No-o-o!  No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man.|Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
No-o-o!  No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man.|Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job.  Like you’d believe that. This sucks!
Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!|
Hey Pheebs!|Hey!
Hey, have you seen Rachel?|No, why?
I have some pretty exciting news!|You’re pregnant!
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!|Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!|Hey! Hi!
Hey!|What’s up?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.|Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh, that’s great. That’s great.
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.|Guys, I’m happy too.
Okay, come here!|Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled…
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|Bye.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel… Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody’s stairs!
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|Ross, it’s not that big a deal! So you’ll been divorced three times, you’ll still have a life, you’ll go on dates…
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|No! No, I won’t! I’ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|Ross, you’re being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|Y’know that’s really fair. Y’know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I’ll show you! Come here.
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|What?! Why?
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn’t you date him?
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|And if you wait right here, I’ll go get Ross.
Hey!|Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
What gave me away?|I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!
Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?|No.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.|Hey!
Hey.|Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.|I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…|What?
|Have a seat.  Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
|Oh my God! That’s so great! I’m so happy for you guys!
|Really?!
|And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
|Yes, we are.
|And Chandler, you’re gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can’t be late.
Rach…|Yeah, he’s gonna work on that.
Rach…|Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God…  Come and knock on my door…
Rach…|We’ll be waiting for you…
…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.|Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?
…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.|Well the divorces don’t bother me, I’d date him. But, not while he’s still married.
…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.|Okay, what about you?  Wouldn’t you want a date?
…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.|Actually, I’m dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y’know bad for me, so until I work that out…
…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.|Whatever! What about you Meg?
…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.|Well, I don’t care about the divorces either, but I wouldn’t date him. It’s just that he’s obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
What?!|
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?|Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!|Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.|Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
—Nothing!!|Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy.
—Nothing!!|I am so attracted to him right now.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?|Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!
Well, Joey’s my best friend.|I’m not your best friend?
You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?|All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.
Okay.|Hey!
Hey-hey!|These aren’t for you! Are you upset?
I am now!|Hey roomie!
Okay, bye!|Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.
Okay, bye!|Are you pregnant?!
Okay, bye!|No! But, I’m throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
Okay, bye!|Um-hmm.
Okay, bye!|Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
Okay, bye!|Oh my God! Oh, that’s funny, I can’t believe I did that.
Okay, bye!|Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn’t clear! I’m really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There’s absolutely no rush.
Okay, bye!|Okay.
Okay, bye!|Okay. Don’t you want a cookie?
Okay, bye!|Sure?  Thanks.
Okay, bye!|Maybe, do you need a tissue?
Okay, bye!|Monica, where did you get these?!
Okay, bye!|I made them!
Okay, bye!|Ooh, good God, they’re so yummy!
God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?" "Can’t, its not there."|Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.|Not once did we do that.
Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.|Hi.
Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.|Hey!
Hi.|So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Hi.|Oh yeah? Well, how’d she take it?
Hi.|Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn’t cry. She wasn’t angry or sad.
Hi.|And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?
Hi.|I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don’t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!|Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
You got married again.|Yes.
So that’s your second marriage in two years.|Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened.|Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…
I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage?|Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Oh, that’s better then.|This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
I see. Have you considered therapy?|I think just the annulment for today.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.|Easy.
And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.|No problem.
And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.|Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.|Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.
Hey!|Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Okay!|Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Okay.|Hey Rach, what about this?  Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!
What the hell is that?|I don’t know.  Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!|Something to remember me by!
Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.|But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Are you okay? You’re not blinking.|I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.
Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.|An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!
What is the matter with you?!|What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!
All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.|What’s hard to believe?
Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.|Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
But I…|No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
It is? Really?|Yeah, sweetie.
I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore?|No.
What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much!|I’m gonna miss you!
I mean it’s the end of an era!|I know!
Okay, bye!|Oh no.
So? Did you get the annulment?|I couldn’t.
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.|It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…
Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.|I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.|I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Ohh, what’s wrong?!|Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Oh my—Come here! Come here!  It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.|Thank you.
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?|Oh we do, but not just yet.
Really?! Well, when?|Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.
Wow.|I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Great!|But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.
Oh-oh, what about Ross?|I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Hey!|Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Hey!|Dude! What are yo—you trying to kill me?!
Hey!|Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
Hey!|Uh-huh, what?
Hey!|Well since I’m movin’ out and-and you’re so beautiful…
Hey!|Oh!
Hey!|…how about I move in with you?
Hey!|Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?
Hey!|Who’s Denise?
Hey!|My roommate.
Hey!|You have a roommate?!
Hey!|Yes, Denise. Denise!
Hey!|Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?
Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?|Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?|Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin’ uh, I’m gonna have an extra room over at my place…
Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?|Oh, that’s true.
Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?|Yeah, why don’t you move in with me? It’ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday’s right?
Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?|Yeah, yeah I think I’m gonna find my own place.
Hey.|Hey!
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?|Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
You didn’t tell her did you?|No.
Of course not, because you’re in love with her.|I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
What do you mean, comforted her?|It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!|It’s also a sign of friendship.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.|It was a hug!
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?|S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.|I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.|If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.|Who was it?
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|Sure!
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven’t thought about it that much.
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|No.
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let’s discuss it before we reject it completely."
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|Oh, I’m sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|So, that’s it?
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|I just don’t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It’s the oldest game!
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|What do you have against the beautiful guest room?
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|I don’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|Are you mocking me?
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|No, I’m not mocking you,
Hey, what’s up?|Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.|"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Pheebs, I have to ask you…|Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.
You’re just staring into space.|Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil.
This one?|It worked!
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full!|Wait, no, look at this!  "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…" Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor.
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full!|Hey!
Hey.|Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Yeah! Why?|Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!|Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here’s Warren’s number.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!|Okay, you go grab it!
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!|I saw it.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!|I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!|Umm, I’m talking about that which you already know but won’t admit. You love her again; you re-love her!
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!|Look, I do not re-love her.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!|I can’t believe you won’t just admit it!  Okay, just promise me that you won’t do anything stupid.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!|Look, we’re just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.|You can live with me.
What?!|What?!
What?!|What?
Oh my God! Are you serious?!|Uh-huh.
I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!|Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.
I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!|Wow! I’m-I’m so happy for you guys.  This is so-so, not stupid.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!|Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!|Oh please!  You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!|No. No, I won’t. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn’t love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that’s how she ended up living with me!  Okay, that’s a lie.
Hi.|Hi.
Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women…|Stop it Chandler.  I’m sorry too.
Really?|Yeah! Oh yes!
Ohh.|Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.|Totally!
We don’t have to come up with this now.|Oh good.
Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?|Changes?
Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.|You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Is that a problem?|Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.
Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.|See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!|Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!
In the game room!|Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?|Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?|
Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.|Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Hey!|Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.|What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.|What?! Over a stupid room!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!|Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!
What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!|Ross, we can handle this.
Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!|Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?|Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?|Love is the best medicine.
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?|That’s laughter.

Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?|I don’t know.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?|Yeah, I do.
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?|Yes.
So I understand you’re looking for a place.|No-no, I’m staying put.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.|Why, where are you going?
I don’t know.|Hey Rach!
I don’t know.|Hi!
I don’t know.|You’re never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That’s great news right—I mean for them. Right?
I don’t know.|Oh wow.
I don’t know.|Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.
I don’t know.|Yeah. Y’know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don’t you think it’s gonna be weird?
I don’t know.|Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?
I don’t know.|Well, because of us! Because of our history.
I don’t know.|No!
I don’t know.|No?
I don’t know.|No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?
I don’t know.|No! Not at all!
I don’t know.|Good! Me neither! So it’s not a problem. We’re just two friends who happen to be roommates.
I don’t know.|Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.
I don’t know.|Really?! We are?
I don’t know.|Yeah! I’m gonna have a boyfriend, you’re gonna have a girlfriend…
I don’t know.|Ohh! That would be great.
I don’t know.|But y’know what, if you think it’s gonna be okay we’ll just work out a system. Y’know, it’ll be like college, I’ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, I’m gettin’ lucky."
I don’t know.|Yeah, I didn’t think of that.
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!|That’s very funny!
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!|He’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!
No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!|Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!|Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!|Yeah, no, me neither.
Fine! It’s your life!|You still want to move in together right?
Fine! It’s your life!|Of course!
Fine! It’s your life!|Ross didn’t scare you?
Fine! It’s your life!|Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
Fine! It’s your life!|Come here, I want to show you something!
Fine! It’s your life!|Okay!
Fine! It’s your life!|Oh my God! Someone’s killed Square Man!
Fine! It’s your life!|This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it’s still walking distance to the kitchen.
Fine! It’s your life!|Oh that’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!
Fine! It’s your life!|Okay!
Fine! It’s your life!|Y’know those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"
Fine! It’s your life!|Uh-hmm.
Fine! It’s your life!|Y’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, that’s you and I together! Merge!
Fine! It’s your life!|Oh my God! I love that!
Fine! It’s your life!|Really?!
Fine! It’s your life!|Uh, no!!

Yes.|No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no… It’s okay, I mean I—look Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursday’s thing, but we don’t have to do that!
Yes.|Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless you’re thinking about Naked Wednesday’s.
Yes.|Thursday’s clearly not good for ya, pick a day!
Hi!|Hi!
Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!|Great!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.|I can do that.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.|Fight.
Very good! Okay. G.|String?
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.|Kitten?
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?|This bottle opener.
And?|And it’s a magnet!
Look at that!|How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me  kitchen.
What?!|You complete me kitchen, matey!
What?!|Ross, I know what you’re thinking.
What?!|What?
What?!|That she’s gonna move in with you and maybe then she’ll fall in love with you and then when she finds out you’re already married, she’ll just be happy. Y’know? You’re just, you’re very sad.
What?!|Oh…my…God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!
What?!|What?!!
What?!|Of course! It all adds up! I mean you you’re obsessed with her. It’s always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!
What?!|No!
What?!|Hello?
Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks  mine?|No-no, I bought those.
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.|Yeah.
|Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|Well, who wouldn’t?!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean it’s temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|Yeah, Professor and Mrs.
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|And Mrs.?!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|Oh! Yeah, y’know you and Ross are still married.
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|What?!!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|Just kidding!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|Ohh! Oh God!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|Saved your ass.
Hey!|Hi.
Hey!|Hey!
Oh, what’s the matter?|Well, you know that psychic I see?
Yeah?|Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that.
What?!|Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
What?!|Phoebe that’s crazy!
What?!|I can’t believe she would say that too you.
What?!|Yeah honey you don’t believe her do you?
What?!|I don’t—she said y’know that I’d have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?|No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now!
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?|Hey everyone!
Oh hi!|Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Oh hi!|Oh that’d be great. Sure!
Oh hi!|"There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct…"
Oh hi!|Oh, this is it. This what’s gonna kill me.
Oh hi!|"…subcategories. The first of these subcategories is…"
Oh hi!|Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?
Oh hi!|No! Why?
Oh hi!|Well, I’ve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didn’t have naked chicks on it.
Oh hi!|Ohh! Okay! Okay.  into…"
Why don’t you open with a joke?|Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|Okay!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|Ohh! We’re kidding! Oh, we’re kidding!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|Thank you!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|Some uh, some visual aides.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|Oh-ooh-ooh! Y’know what’s a good visual aide?
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|Please don’t say naked chicks.
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|Why not?!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|I-I-I don’t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Y’know what? I’m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.
Hey.|Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.|Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda….
"Benefits lapsed."|Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.|Let me see that!
All right.|Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.|All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.|
Hey!|Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?
Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could—|Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?|Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Monica!
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Hmm?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Did-did you take these back?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Oh yeah, they’re really great! Aren’t they?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|I loved them!
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Yeah.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Hello!
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Hey!
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Hey!
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|How’d the lecture go?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|It went great! And I didn’t need any jokes or naked chicks either!
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Wow, that’s great Ross, I’m sorry we weren’t more supportive before.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyone’s all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, I’m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|That you’re not funny or sexy?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|That’s right!
Hey Estelle, listen…|Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!|Really?!
Yeah!|Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.|All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Why?|Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Hey!|Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.
That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?|What?!
What’s wrong with you?|Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!|No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
That’s a hernia.|Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.|Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa.  Wow, we really are bitches.|Oh bloody hell.
What the hell are you doing?!|Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
What the hell are you doing?!|Yeah, and not a very good one.
What the hell are you doing?!|Will you-will you please?
What the hell are you doing?!|Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, I’m a professor in the paleontology department here.
What the hell are you doing?!|Oh.
What the hell are you doing?!|Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?
What the hell are you doing?!|I’m sorry, I’ve got plans with my sister.
|What are you doing?
Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!|Just please stop!
Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!|Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!|Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.|Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.|Hey!
Hey.|Hey!
Hey.|What’s going on?
Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!|Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn’t hurt that bad.
Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!|Hey! Maybe you’ll die!
Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!|Sure, now I’m scared.
Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!|No, we can go together! Just don’t wait too long though, okay? ‘Cause I’m outta here sometime before Friday.
Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!|Yeah, but I don’t wanna die!
Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!|No-no, it’ll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!
Gimme ‘em!|No! They are mine!
You stole them from me!|You stole them from me!!
You just wanna each take one?|Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
You just wanna each take one?|Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?
You just wanna each take one?|Well…
Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.|Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!
Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.|They’re not listening too me?
Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.|Of course they’re listening to you! Everybody listens to you.
Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.|Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?
Whenever you’re ready.|Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you."
Hold it. I’m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less…intense?|Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second.  "Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!"
So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!|That’s where you pick up the bag.
Exactly.|No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today.  I didn’t get it, did I?|No.
Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for  man.|You mean dying man?
Okay, come on, do it one more time!|Really? Really?!
Yes!|Okay!
Yes!|Hey!
Yes!|Hey!
Yes!|Listen to this! My reading was wrong, I’m not going die!
Yes!|Really?! How do you know?

Hello?|Hello, is Ross there?
Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?|Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try.
|What’s happening to your accent?
All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…|Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Have you really done this before?|Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold back.
Hey!|Hey-hey-hey!
Hey!|What are you doing?
We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.|Oh, all right.
I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!|Look I was going to tell you!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|What?
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|You’re kidding!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|Oh my God!!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|Ross!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|Okay, maybe it wasn’t my best decision. But I just couldn’t face another failed marriage.
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|Rach, come on, if you think about it, it’s actually kinda funny.  Okay, maybe it’s best not to think about it.
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|Phoebe, I told her you already knew.
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|Another lie. You have a sickness!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|Ross, just for my own piece of mind, you’re not married to anymore of us are ya?
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys.  Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcriber’s note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche, I’d have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther, these yours?|Yeah, that’s what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?|Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?
There’s a lost and found?|You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield.|Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks.|Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Great! Thanks.|Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!
Great! Thanks.|Yeah, all right.
Great! Thanks.|Okay, well I’ll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, they’re not actually puppies, they’re Frank and Alice’s triplets. Okay, see ya!
Great! Thanks.|Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?
Great! Thanks.|Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and I’m nervous ‘cause I’ve never done that before by myself!
Great! Thanks.|Don’t worry about it Phoebe, we’ll absolutely do it.
Great! Thanks.|Yeah, I’m gonna pass. ‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.
Great! Thanks.|Come on Chandler, come on! It’ll give us great practice for when——people with babies come to visit.
Nice car!|Yeah, it’s not mine.
Nice car!|I love your car.
Nice car!|Yeah, it’s  mine.
Nice car!|I bet it’s fast.
Nice car!|Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?
Nice car!|Yeah!
Nice car!|It’s got ‘em!
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.|What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.|Maybe you could be my roommate!
Well there’s an idea!!|Yeah!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?|Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.|Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.
Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!|Okay Rach, but…
Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!|Look I told you…
I don’t wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"|Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!
Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!|What about the time I said we were on a break?
Pheebs, how’s it going?|I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.|Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.|Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.|See that’s where I think that you’re wrong. We’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
What do you mean?|I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around…
What do you mean?|That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.
What do you mean?|Okay, I’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|Hey guys!
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|Hey!
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|Hey!
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|Hey babies! Oh, I’m having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche I’ve got the keys too, still there!
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|You should see the treatment I get when I’m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|What equity investments?
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they’re gonna start to think that I don’t own it. So I figured I’ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.|You don’t even have a car!
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.|And?
And six others.|There you are.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.|Wow!
And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.|Really! You got a place upstate?
Sure!|Well, I’ll see you later.
Okay, take it easy.|Hey! That’s my car.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.|What-what are you doing?
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.|But it’s my car!
Yeah, but it’s my wax.|Listen, I-I-I don’t come to this city much so I don’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Sure. Here.  I’ll uh, save your parking spot.|I’m not coming back.
Why not?|I live upstate.
I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.|Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.
I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.|
I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.|Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someone’s eye out!
I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.|He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.|They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
What?!|Glass, sand, whatever.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.|Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Oh, I can still do that.|How are you still single?!
Oh, I can still do that.|I thought about it and maybe you’re right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
Oh, I can still do that.|Good. What made you change your mind?
Oh, I can still do that.|I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
How did that happen?!!|Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat.
How did that happen?!!|Damnit! Y’know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler!
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?|Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.|Fine, I’m mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.|What?!
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.|Uh yes, heroin and crack.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.|Crack isn’t even an intravenous drug!
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.|Well, you would know.
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?|Oh, come on!
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?|Ross, please, I found the magazines!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin.|Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
That won’t be necessary.|And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
That won’t be necessary.|Ugh!
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.|Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?|Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.|That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.|What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.|And what— Stop typing! Stop typing!!
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.|Okay, do you see, do you see what you’re keeping me married too?!
You need to get out of my chambers.|All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
You need to get out of my chambers.|Yeah!
Would you like to spend the night in jail?|And thank you for your time.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.|But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.|And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?|That is true.
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?|Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.
Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.|Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|All right, that’s it, we’re going to the emergency room.
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|What?! No, you can’t, you can’t leave me here with them! We’re baby-sitting!
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|The babies are asleep, I’m sure you’ll be okay on your own for a while!
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|But you-you can’t leave me with them! We-we’re a team! We’re playing a zone! They’re gonna triple team me!
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|He’s got something plastic lodged in his throat, we’ve got to go to the hospital.
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|But no, because a doctor won’t be able to help him, it’s just gonna y’know naturally pass through his system in like seven years.
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|I think that’s gum.
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|I’m pretty sure it’s gun.
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|Okay, listen this really hurts. Let’s go.
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|A real man wouldn’t just run to the hospital!
Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?|Maybe because you’ve got the keys?
Porsche.|This is totally your fault!
Porsche.|My fault?! You threatened the judge!
Porsche.|Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter’s machine!!
Porsche.|That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!
Hi! How are the Gellers?|Don’t call us that!
Hi! How are the Gellers?|The judge wouldn’t let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you?
Hey!|How do you feel?
Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.|Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.
And protected them from a tornado?|Oh my God.
And protected them from a tornado?|I know, the babies are asleep.
And protected them from a tornado?|Phoebe, what, what happened here?!
And protected them from a tornado?|I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!
And protected them from a tornado?|But my apartment!
Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.|But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.|You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried.|I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.
Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!|Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!|Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!|Yeah! Right!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!|You’re right. That’s very different. So let’s, let’s just sign the papers. All right?  What?
Nothing.|Okay, can we just sign please?
Uh-hmm.|Congratulations.
Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.|What?
Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.|Excuse me?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?|Yeah?
And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.|So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.
Yeah, don’t push it though.|I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.|Did I, did I even treat?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.|That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.|Eh, no problem.
I’m gonna need a copy of those.|Totally.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!|Hi Joey.
Hey! How you doin’?|He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.|Right! And when is that due?
First of the month.|And that’s every month?
No, just the months you actually want to live here.|Ahhh.
Okay, here is the phone bill.|Oh my God!!
That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?|No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.
It’s not charity, Joe…|No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.
Okay uh, here’s the electric bill.|This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?|No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.
Well, how much do you think he needs?|I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.
Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.|Well that would help the pride thing.
Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.|Hey!
Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.|Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.|Okay.
Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.|Okay!  So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.|Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we’d go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
And also, my birthday.|It’s not your birthday.
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!|Hey!
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!|Hey!
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!|Hey!
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?|Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?|Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?|I don’t know Ross, not if you’re gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.

Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?|Pheebs, I was wondering…
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?|You’re not dressed yet?! We’re supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!

Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?|Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you’re packed.
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?|Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.|Yeah, yeah, I know.
Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.|Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!
Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.|Surprise!!
Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.|What?
Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.|No, no don’t get mad because look—this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.|I’ll be coordinator! Oh my God! I’m so sorry, I didn’t get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can’t you Phoebe?
I have plans.|You’re plans were with us.
That’s right.|All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Okay.|Okay!  Oh my God, thank you!!
Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re gonna start with…

Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|I’ve got Ben.
Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|Because, because I’ve got Ben.
Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|It’s almost 8 o’clock, it’s almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|He’s at a dinner party.
Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|Of course he is! What, do you think I’d just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|All right, sorry.
Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|I gotta go make a fake Ben.
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.|Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!|Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.|Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you’re on.|Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.|Oh God!
You remember when we got these?|No.
I guess you weren’t there.|You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time…  You don’t remember?
I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.|I’m gonna miss you so much.
I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.|Well, this doesn’t have to be so sad though. Y’know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you’re gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you’re not gonna miss.
I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.|I don’t think there’s anything.
I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.|Come on, there’s gotta be something.
I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.|Nope, she’s perfect.
I have one.|Good! Great! You can go first.
Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen.|Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen.|Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen.|Okay, good. There you go. Doesn’t anyone feel better?
Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen.|Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
You get your messages!|Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?|Great! It worked! No one’s sad.
I gotta buy some food.|Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?|Oh yes!
Okay, get ready to owe me!|Okay.
Hello?  See? Other people call me!|Ooh, your brother. Score!
What’s up?|Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.
Oh, put him on!|Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.  Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?|You know what else I’m not gonna miss? "I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?|"Hi I’m Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I’d better wash it and shrink it!"
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?|"I’m Monica, I don’t get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
Hey! I call her!|"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Hey! I call her!|"Oh my God, I can’t find a boyfriend! So I guess I’ll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
Still broken?|This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?|Nah, not my game.
Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.|Well, what’s it called?
Cups.|I don’t know how to play Cups.
I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.|All right.
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?|A two and a five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!|Really?!
Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again.  What do you got?|A four and a nine.
You’re kidding right?|No. Why?
Well that’s a full cup!|Damn! I am good at Cups!
I’m not talking to her!|Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!
Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!|I know, I took it hard too.
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing?|I’m unpacking!
What?!|I’m not moving!  Is that picture straight?
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!|Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Because it’s my apartment!|Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!
How about, you’re moving!!|Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
How about, you’re moving!!|Hey, how are you guys doing?
How about, you’re moving!!|Great! Monica’s moving!
I am not!|Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
I am not!|Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what’s going on here. Okay, you guys… STOP!!  I know that, I know that you’re acting mad because you think that it’ll make it easier to leave. But deep down you’re still really sad. Deep-deep down.
No Phoebe I am mad!|Well, deep-deep-deep down!
No Phoebe I am mad!|Yeah, I’m just mad!
No Phoebe I am mad!|Then keep running.
You win.|Well, what did you have?
It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?|Uh,  wow, 700.
Not 700 exactly?|Yeah.
Double it!|What?
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.|Really?
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"|Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"|Hey you guys, I don’t mean to make things worse, but umm, I don’t want to live with Rachel anymore.
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"|What?!
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"|You’re just so mean to each other! And I don’t want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"|Well, Phoebe that’s fine because I’m not moving.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.|Oh really? Like what Monica?
Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…|Oh yeah, good start Mon.
She lets you borrow them.|Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold!  She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.|What else?
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.|Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.|That’s nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.|Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.|Oh, it’s gonna be fine.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.|Okay Rachel, I can’t wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We’ll have so much fun!!
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.|But honey, I think she’s moving in with Chandler.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.|Oh that’s right. You’re still set on that?
Hey!|What’s wrong?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!|Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!!|Oh man!!
And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.|All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.|I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
It’s him, not it!|No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?
Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!|When did I try to give you money?
Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!|I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?|Okay.
I’m really gonna miss you.|Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Thanks.|Yeah.
Thanks.|Oh God! This is silly, I’m gonna see you in a couple of hours!
Yeah.|Bye house!
Yeah.|Bye Mon.
Bye.|Hey.
She really left.|I know.
Thank you.|No problem roomie.
Can I ask you a question?|Sure!
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.|And now you want that money back.
Exactly.|Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
It’s not a real game! I made it up!|I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!!|Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.|No.
Ready?|Yeah.
Okay.|Hi...
it's...|Rachel...
and…|Phoebe’s...
please...|leave...
leave…|Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it’s," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.|Phoebe, come on that's silly.
All right, so let's switch.|No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Okay.|Okay.
Hi…|Everybody…
It's…|Rachel…
and…|Phoebe’s…
Please...wait, how did you do that?|What?
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?|Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Really?|Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.
Okay, let's go running!|Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Let's run towards them!|OK!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!|Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.|And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Hey!|Hey!
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!|I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Oh, So you can move them!|Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!|Hi.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!|Hi!
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!|Hi
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!|It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!|Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!|So, uh, wh-where ya from?
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!|Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!|So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!|I'm a dancer.
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!|Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Oh, hey let me.|Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Of course I did.|Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
"When can you move in?"|Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
"When can you move in?"|Unbelievable
"When can you move in?"|Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
"When can you move in?"|Hey, look at all the boxes!
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!|Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!|Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!|All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
Oh God, yeah.|Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Okay!|No-no
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!|Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.|Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.|Okay.
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.|Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Oh! I used to do that too!|Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Aw, Mon...|So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.|Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.|Yeah.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
Why? Why would you do that?|I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
Why? Why would you do that?|Ankle.
Why? Why would you do that?|We'll see.
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man.|I Gotcha!!
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.|Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?|I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?|Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it.  How you doin?
Ohhhh man|Sorry, there's just more room out here.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.|Why don't you try to do-
|What's wrong?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower.  Oh my God!|Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.|No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.|No, wait Phoebe.
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?|What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?|Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Put it back exactly where you found it?|Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it.
‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.|She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?|She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.|I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|Hi!
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|Hey Mon, how's it going?
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon!  She's-she's gonna kill me.
We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.|Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.|Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.|Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!|Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!|Hey, I've been married 3 times
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!|No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!|Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?|Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.|Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
That's not specific to girls.|This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
That's not specific to girls.|Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.|They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.|I'm never gonna find love again.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?|Sure
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.|So, what should you have done?
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.|Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...|So?
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.|Why do you care?
Because they're people.|But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.|Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.|That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?  The neighbor's dog.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?|Who cares? I repel women.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.|What?!
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.|What?!
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.|Why does anyone have to be naked?
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.|Why is Ross naked?
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.|I-I had to show Chandler something?
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.|Naked?
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.|Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.|Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.|Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Bye! Thank God|Dude, what'd you have?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.|The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!|So really, what'd ya have?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.|Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?|Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is there something wrong?|All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey...|No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.|Oh!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.|Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.|Oh, I do.  How you doin?
I'm OK|What?!?!
What?|Oh dear God!
Hey!|Hey!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!|See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Is it okay for me to come in now?|Uh-huh
Why is everything different?|Bye!
Why is everything different?|No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.|Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?|Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.|Really?
Of course!|Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...|...and live forever as a machine!
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.|Yeah, I gotta go.
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.|Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
Hey.|Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Sure, neighbor come on in.|So, is Janine around?
Uh, no, she’s at dance class.|Can I check out what she did to my room?
Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad.|It’s spreading already.
It is???|Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
No.|Is that your tiny little box, that’s too small to put anything in?
No.|No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her.|Yes talk to her. Be a man.
I’m a man.|Defend yourself.
|Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
|Be right there sweetums.  A totally different situation.
Hey guys.|Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.|Ohh, yeah.
It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.|Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
Yeah.|The one that always stares at me when I come in?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Still I could tell. She was into me.  Well, why don’t you set us up?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Hey.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Hey.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Rachel?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Yeah.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|I’m, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale’s and use the copy machine.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Well, sure, but they might think it’s kinda weird considering I don’t work there anymore.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Oh my God. What happened?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Well that’s great! Congratulations!!
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Yeah.  A year ago..
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|You’ve lasted a whole year. Good for you.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn’t see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn’t like me very much.
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|That’s weird. I don’t think my boss likes me either.
I don’t think mine likes me either.|Maybe it’s a universal thing?
I don’t think mine likes me either.|Or maybe, it’s because you’re hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
I don’t think mine likes me either.|Yeah let’s head off to work.
Thank you.|Sure.
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.|Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.|What? What!?! You kissed him?
Totally.|Phoebe are you serious?
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know.|Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?
No!|Phoebe…
Hey Joey.|Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
No, I just thought it was cute.|Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh…Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly.
Ohh. Like what?|Like this.  Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We..we can’t have that.
Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist.|Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.
Well, I’m sorry. I just thought I’d try to make the place a little nicer.|Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Well I just thought…|I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It’s a curling iron.|Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook..and…smells different.
It’s clean.|Yeah, well, it feels different.
It’s dry.|Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is with these chips you bought?
No no no no, it’s potpourri. You’re supposed to smell it.|Well that’s like summer in a bowl.
Oh, Kim, Hi.|Uhh-huh.
So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.|I didn’t read it.
Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh?|Yeah.
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.|Tell me everything.
Hey guys.|Hey.
What’s up?|You know…Oh My God.
What’s up?|What happened to your teeth.
I whitened them.|Really.
Yeah. What do you think.|Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.
Come on, seriously.|Ross they’re really, really, really white.
Come on, seriously.|Yeah, what was wrong with your old…human teeth.
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.|How much longer?
A-A day.|Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
I know. That’s why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?|No, no no no. You’ll be fine.  Hillary’s bind, right?
I know. That’s why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?|She will be after tonight.
I know. That’s why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?|Yeah.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.  You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|What???
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Oh my god.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just…made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she’d heard all year.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|I am proud of all my friends today.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|My God, Rachel, I can’t believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I’m so jealous.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Hi, I’m Chandler. Your live-in boy
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Hey. Here.  Ohh, who’s the silver fox?
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|That-that is your make out buddy. Don’t you recognize him?  Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|That’s not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|What?
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Yeah, no, Ralph doesn’t look anything like that guy. He’s-he’s young and he’s got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Oh My God, Phoebe, that’s not Ralph Lauren. That’s Kenny the copy guy.
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|What?
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|To get you to make out with him!!!
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Ohhh.
Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.|I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.|Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.|Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.|But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.|What??
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.|No. I am not putting on makeup.
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.|Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me?  OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.|Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.
Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.|Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.|Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.|You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.|No thanks, Josephine.
Ohh, hi, Kim.|Hi Rachel.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.|You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.|That’s not true?
No.|Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.|Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard.|Hi Ralph.
I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard.|: Hi Kim.
I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard.|Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.|Mmm-Hmm.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.|Mmm.
You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.|Mm-Hmm.
After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?|Hmm-Hmm.
I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?|Mmm-Unmm.
Come on. I want to know.|Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.
So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.|Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.|Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.|Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I’m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
Ohh, I love birds.|What is the matter with you ?!?
What?|You’re arranging flowers!  You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.|You’re turning into a women.
No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.|Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.|But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.
I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.|Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?|Just for a second.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?|Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.|Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
That wouldn’t help me.|Ohh, yes it would.
I’ve had a really good time tonight.|Mmm.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.|
Are you going to eat that bread?|Mmmm.
You make me laugh.|Hmm-Hmm.
Would you like to move over to the couch?|Mmm-Hmm.
Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.|How about all the way.
Okay.|So, ahh, where were we?
Are those your teeth??|Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Yes. They’re insanely white.|I-I, did that for you.
What’s a matter with you?|What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!
Kim, hi.|Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.|Oh, really?
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry." And then I don’t know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."|You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry." And then I don’t know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."|: Hi Kim.
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry." And then I don’t know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."|Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It’s like he hates you. Then it is true.
Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.|Ohh honey come here.  Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all been there.
You and Ralph?|Kenny the copyboy.
Hey.|Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
What’s the matter? Are you upset?|I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.
Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room.|Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know.  You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Okay.|And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
Sure.|And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?|Okay.
So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?|Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
No, my parents.|Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!
Why can’t I tell them that we live together?|Because they don’t know we’re dating.
Why haven’t you told them?!|Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.
Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!|
Why wouldn’t they be happy?|Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.
What? What? Why?!|Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?|Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.
Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.|You really think that’ll work?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?|I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!
Yes, of course they like you!|Well Monica just told me that they don’t.
Yeah, they don’t like you.|Do you know why?
I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-|Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.|Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.|Well maybe I love ya’.
Hey.|Hey.
No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!|Are you guys going to Chandler’s for Thanksgiving?
No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!|Yeah! Yeah, why? What’s up?
No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!|Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
For real?|No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows how to cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day.
For real?|Ye-ye, we go to yours!
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.|Okay.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
Nothing.|Nothing?
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.|So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?
You’re not gonna mess it up.|Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
Hey!|And the place looks so nice!
Hey!|Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
Hey!|Happy Thanksgiving!
Hey!|Happy Thanksgiving!
Hey!|Well, this has been great!
Hey!|See ya!
Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?|Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?|Some would say she’s attractive, yes.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?|And who else is going to be there?
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?|Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?|Her dancer friends?
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?|Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they’re gonna be, be drinkin’ and dancin, and we really wanna go!
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?|Dude, we were good!
You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!|Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!|Oh, but-but it is, uh, it’s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!|Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
Hello everybody!|Hi!
Hello everybody!|Hi!
Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!|Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!|Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
Whoa, snowing out there?|No.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.|My joke wasn’t funny.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.|Really?!
Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!|Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!|I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!|Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?
Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!|Yeah, yeah, what is it?
Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!|It’s a truffle. It’s got all of these layers. First there’s a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like something’s wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
W-What was the one right before bananas?|The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
W-What was the one right before bananas?|Y-sure!
W-What was the one right before bananas?|And while I’m gone don’t you boys sneak a taste.
W-What was the one right before bananas?|Okay.
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!|Chandler!
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!|Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.|Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!|Vomiting stories are funny...
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!|Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
No!|Still not hot enough!
Rachel?|Yeah?
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.|Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.|Oh, yes. Well it’s very beautiful. It’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I don’t mean tight, I mean it’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.|What’s the matter with him?
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.|I think he’s stoned again.
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.|What?
What?|Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.|You do? Why?
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.|What?! Why did you do that?
I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.|How could it not matter?!
How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?|What about all that “friends forever” stuff?
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!|Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!|The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!|Okay, okay, I’ll tell ‘em it wasn’t Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!|Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-|Monica, leave him alone!
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?|No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.
Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?|Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”
So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?|Oh I am!
Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!|Okay, fine!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?|Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.|What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?|Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?|Okay...
What’s up, Ross?|So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Yeah!|And um...You look nice today.
Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.|What?
I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.|Eh?
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.|You’re alone.
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.|Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!
Oh and , okay?|Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!|Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.
Really?|No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!
Really?|So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn’t it?
Really?|It sure is.
Really?|Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
Really?|Beef.
Really?|I can’t have any. You know I don’t eat meat.  Ohhh no.
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.|Really?
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!|Okay.
Well?|Mmmm! It’s good!
Really? How good?|It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Mmm.|Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
I’ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica’s room.|I’ll help you dial.
It tastes like feet!|I like it.
Are you kidding?|What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Rachel, come here.  Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.|Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.|Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Boy, I’m glad I wore the big belt today.|Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Ross? Let’s go.|Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.|Wha-what?
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!|What?!
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!|You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!|Yes.
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!|Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I’m sorry.
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!|It was you?
I love Jacques Cousteau!|I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!
I love Jacques Cousteau!|I wanna gooooooo!
I love Jacques Cousteau!|Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
I love Jacques Cousteau!|And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
I love Jacques Cousteau!|Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
I love Jacques Cousteau!|What happened son?
I love Jacques Cousteau!|I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
I love Jacques Cousteau!|Chandler! You’ve been Ross’s best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems.  And now you’ve taken on Monica as well. Well, I don’t know what to say. You’re a wonderful human being.
Thank you!|No! Thank you!  Monica, and Ross! I don’t know what I’m gonna do about the two of you!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!|Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!|No it isn’t, I ate that.
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!|Well we left ours in Monica’s bedroom.
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!|Nope, got it and I got yours  too.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.|That’s a good story, Grandpa.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.|Hey

Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.|Wow, Monica’s letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.|Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. It’s about being with the people that you love.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.|That is nice and we’re done. TADA!
I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.|Oh, here.
… and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.|So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.

I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!|Hey guys!
Hi Janine!|I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve.
Hi Janine!|Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve?
Hi Janine!|Yeah, that’s what I said.
Hi Janine!|Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!
Hi Janine!|Ah, you’re still just a little fat girl inside aren’t you?
Hi Janine!|Well I’m gonna be on it this year. I’m gonna be one of the party people.
You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!|Well they said I should bring someone.  Do you wanna be my dance partner?
You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!|Totally! I would love to spend New Year’s with you.
You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!|Well actually they’re taping tomorrow. I don’t really understand why.
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.|Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Are you serious?|We are there!
Are you serious?|What, what are you laughing at?
Are you serious?|Well, I used to date him, but you’re still going out with her!
Are you serious?|Thanks.  Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!
Are you serious?|Bye!
Bye Janine!|Did she just ask me out on a date?
Bye Janine!|I don’t think so.
Bye Janine!|What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!
Bye Janine!|Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I’m sorry, but I don’t think that was a romantic thing.
Bye Janine!|Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We’re going to a New Year’s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y’know? But if she says ‘Dude, what the hell are you doing?’ I can say ‘It wasn’t me, it was New Years!’
Bye Janine!|Well, that’s a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.
It was a dry day.|We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!
Oh my God!|Oh my God!
Oh my God!|Oh my God!

Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present?

Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.|What’s the matter with you? Get out of here!
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.|Yeah, take a hike wetpants!
Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!|I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?

Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know?|Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know?|Alright we’re back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!|Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?

And the big one’s for me!|Okay! Okay! Okay!
Hee hee!|Wait, we can’t do this.
Hee hee!|Why?
Hee hee!|I don’t wanna know what Monica got me. Y’know? I mean, look, I’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.
Hee hee!|Whatever Linus, I’m opening mine.
Hee hee!|Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I don’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monica’s face when I give her my present, and I’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?
Will you get us better gifts?|Fine!
Will you get us better gifts?|Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?
Will you get us better gifts?|That’s what you got me?
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, y’know? Anyway, g’night!|Joey.
Yeah?|Happy New Year.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?|Well, I don’t know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn’t get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.|In the moment, yeah.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?|Sure, New Year’s Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No.|Me neither.
3, 2,|Joey, you don’t have to count down every time we kiss.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’|Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!|‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
What? We could do it!|I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.

Hey!|Hey!
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?|Honey, we have been through this before!
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?|Yeah. Don’t do this to yourself.
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?|She’s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact  that I just kissed her!|You serious?!

Bye.|I am so glad you said cooks.
Bye.|I know.
Bye.|
Bye.|Oh-oh, Pottery Barn!  You can throw the rest away.
Bye.|I’m not your garbage man. I’m your mailman.
Bye.|Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
Bye.|You got it from Pottery Barn?!
Bye.|Yeah! It’s an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
Bye.|A pharmacist.
Bye.|Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
Bye.|I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
Bye.|You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
Bye.|I was tired!
Bye.|Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
Bye.|Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
Bye.|Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
Bye.|It’s gotta be one of a kind. Y’know like umm, y’know uh, what’s that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
Bye.|Hey! I made that for her!
Bye.|You made pottery?
Bye.|Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
Bye.|I’m telling—If you put that in her apartment you’ll never hear the end of it.
Bye.|Okay fine! I’ll-I’ll just tell her it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
Bye.|Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore…
…so then the farmer says, "That’s not a cow and you’re not milking it."|I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!|I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!|Yeah.

Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys.|See ya tomorrow!
Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys.|Tomorrow!
Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys.|Can’t wait!
How are we gonna get out of that one?|What?
I can’t handle two nights in a row with them.|What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
I don’t know, they’re just a little blah!|Blah?!
Well y’know, he’s blah, she’s just—she’s very loud for such a small person.|Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y’know, not two nights in a row. Okay?|I guess.
Thank you.|If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Hey!|Hey!
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?|Guess!
Umm, a flea market?|Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where  they kept all the stuff to make their potions.|Ohh, yes.
Y’know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.|Almost.
How much was it?|It was only 500 bucks.
500 bucks at a flea market?!|Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y’know like back then.
Oh no.|Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was like a dollar.
A dollar?|And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.|Yeah.
Well, what period is it from?|Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or…|Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Hey! We’re here!|Hey!
Ohh! Oh my God!|You like it?
Oh no!|It’s my new apothecary table!
Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!|Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.|Why did you do that?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.|She hates Pottery Barn?!!
I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  So come on, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?|What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!|Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.|Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.|Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!
Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.|Hey!

Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!|Sure!
He got it a flea market!|You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Hey!|Hi!

The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.|Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it’s just gonna be me again tonight.
What happened to Janine?|Oh, she’s uh-uh really sick.
What happened to Janine?|Oh that’s too bad.
What happened to Janine?|Yeah, she’s been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem… Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
What happened to Janine?|Monica! Chandler! I’m really-really sorry about tonight. I don’t know if Joey told you; I just couldn’t get out of going to this play. I’m sorry. Have a great time.
What happened to Janine?|‘Kay!
What happened to Janine?|Bye.
What happened to Janine?|That’s funny, I saw no phlegm.
No-no, she really is sick!|Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Uh, y’know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.|Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry.|Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.|What?
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.|So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.|Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.|And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date! Plus, she’s really sick!|No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!
I know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?|Eh, they’re both good. I generally just go with, Monica’s drunk again.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She’ll come around I promise.|Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She’ll come around I promise.|Okay.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She’ll come around I promise.|I do not like that woman!

Aww!|Ross, where did you get this?!
Aww!|I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
Aww!|Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
Aww!|Wow! Oh my God, well if they’ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
Aww!|Oh yes.
Aww!|Well this doesn’t even smell like opium.
Aww!|Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
Aww!|Oh Ross, calm down, I’ll give you the 80 cents.
Okay, one more time.|Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Perfect decibel.|I know!!!
Perfect decibel.|Hey!
Hey.|So uh, what are you guys doing?
Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.|Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.|Well, I’d like to but,  I’m not sure we have time to go.
Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.|Ha-ha, very funny—Look! I don’t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.|We owe you?!
Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.|That’s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.|We didn’t give you any money!
Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.|You don’t think I know that!
…see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.|Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.|A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.|Hey!
Hey.|Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Hey.|Fascinating.
Hey.|Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.|Ah!
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.|Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear.|Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.|Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.|Really?!  Hey, y’know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here’s-here’s 60 bucks, why don’t you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.|No! I do want to!
Oh, she does want to.|She does want to.
Oh, she does want to.|Yeah!
Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.|Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Yeah.|Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it.|No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!
Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go.|That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the…  We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, on the other side.|Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.|No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.|I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?
What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!|But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!|Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
That’s right!|But at least the apothecary table is real.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?|Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I’ve got to say, I’m sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?|That’s totally understandable.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?|Don’t worry about it.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?|So we can go out again?
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?|Oh yeah!
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?|Absolutely!
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?|Oh good.
Oh well then, good night!|Good night!
See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?|We have got to move!
See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?|I knew it!! Y’know, you’re not so quiet yourself, missy!
See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?|And I’m blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?|Y’know, I know you’re talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?|All right! You and me! Let’s go! Right now!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough!|Y’know I think you can take her.
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough!|
All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can’t treat them that way.|They said stuff to me too, y’know!
I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t.  I’m very upset.|Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
What did I tell you about the hall?!|I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I’d really like it if we could be friends.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.|Great.
Now come on.  Well, I’m glad we worked things out.|Me too.
Okay.|I’ll see you.
Bye.|Or I’ll hear you.
Come on!|Wait!
You’d better run!|Did you hear that?
You’d better run!|Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
You’d better run!|Yeah, I’m sorry man.  You wanna go watch?
You’d better run!|Yeah!
Hey!|How ya doin’?
Hey!|Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
Hey!|Pretty much, yeah.
Hey!|I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
Hey!|Well, when it’s not right, you know it.
Hey!|You okay?
Hey!|Yeah! Yeah. I’ll be all right.
Y’know what would cheer you up?|What?
I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.|You’re right! That did cheer me up!
I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.|Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen
I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.|Shana Goldberg-Meehan
Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!|I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.|That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.
Here, check it out. It’s the first one, too.|That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
What?|I made that joke up.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.|Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.
What?|I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
What?|Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?
What?|No.
What?|Seriously?
What?|Well, you tell a lot of jokes!
Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?|Yeah, I guess.
Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?|Hey guys.
Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?|Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.
No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you.|It’s my joke.
It’s my joke.|Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.|Let’s go watch it at your place.
Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.|Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?|No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…
Joey, why is your cable out?|I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?|No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Whoa ho.|I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?|Sure.
Paid your phone bill?|Not so much.
Hey.|It’s only you.
Wh-wh-what are you doing?|We are looking at a Playboy.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!|So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!|Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she’s crying out, ‘Where are they, where are they?’
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!|Well, she’s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?|Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?|You see, now, I would date this girl. She’s cute, she’s outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that’s got to come in handy
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?|Okay, I’ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?|I don’t know.
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?|Me neither.
Rachel.|What?!
You forget how many great songs Heart had.|Yeah.
You forget how many great songs Heart had.|You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.
You forget how many great songs Heart had.|So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I’ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|Yeah!
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|Well, I’m not going to go now anyway .
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|Okay .
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|Here you go.
Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.|Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.|Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?!|Flexible hours.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.|He took my joke, he took it.
It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.|You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
That’s a good idea.|Yeah!
Do you know what’s a bad idea?|Picking Rachel.
That’s right.  Did you hear something?|Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
It’s coming from the living room.|
Hey, you guys.|Hey.
Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.|Monica, what are you doing?
Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.|I guess it was kinda funny.
It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?|Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!
That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!|No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.
That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!|Well, people are different.
That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!|Ya, you know, Rachel … she’ll do whatever you want. Y’know, you can just walk all over her.
That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!|What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I’m a pushover? I’m not a pushover.
That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!|Oh, okay,  you’re not a pushover.
That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!|Oh my … you think I’m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? You’re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think that’s pretty strong, that’s what I think. Come on, Monica, let’s go to lunch.
I cannot believe her.|I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.|I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.|All right.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.|Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.|Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, ‘cause I’m heading up there.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Sure.  Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|No.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|No, thank you.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|You guys need anything, ‘cause I’m heading up there.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|I’d love an ice water.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|You got it.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Joey, what are you doing?
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Just being friendly.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Joey, honey, I don’t think you’re supposed to go back there.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Nah, it’s okay. Right, Gunther?
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Don’t wink at me. And put on your apron.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Okay, but I don’t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Joey, do you work here?
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|No.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Hey, waiter.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Yeah?
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|So is your apron. You’re wearing it like a cape.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|I mean, the job’s easy and the money’s good, you know? I guess I’m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|Okay, I guess it doesn’t seem that weird.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven’t gotten it.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|See, now it’s weird again.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|I think it’s great that you work here. You’re going to make a lot of money, and here’s your first tip: Don’t eat yellow snow. . Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right.  And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y’know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It’s all about turnover.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|Oh, I’m sorry, Ross. I’ll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, I’ll toss in a free muffin.
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.|Okay.
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.|So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.|Hah!
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.|That true, I am flaky.
So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?|Yeah, totally.
So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?|Well, then, I’m okay with being high maintenance.
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.|That’s great. Good for you guys.
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.|I am not high maintenance!
I am not a pushover!|Who said you were?
I am not a pushover!|You did!
I am not a pushover!|Oh, I’m flaky. I’ll say anything.
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.|No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’|That’s the whole part?
Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …|Okay, I’ll see you in an hour.
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’|Oh, excuse me.
No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?|I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
So, you’d hire me, right?|For what?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.|Huh? What?
It’s my joke.|It’s my joke.
It’s my joke.|It’s my joke.
Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.|Let’s have Monica decide.
Yeah!|Yeah!
Hey Mon.|Mon, get out here!
Monica!|Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Monica!|Why do I have to decide?
Monica!|Because you’re the only one that can be fair.
Yeah.|I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.
Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.|I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.
We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.|Okay, Chandler, you go first.
We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.|Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.
We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.|Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?
We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.|Can I finish my story?!
We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.|Do you want me to pick you?!
See, I would never snap at you like that.|Continue.
See, I would never snap at you like that.|So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve’s doctor’s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, ‘Doctor Monkey?’ And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!|I’m not arguing with that.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!|All right, I’ve heard enough. I’ve made my decision.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!|You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it’s offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn’t be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!
It’s your joke.|Is not.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.|Hi, oh hi.
Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?|—generosity of spirit.
Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?|Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I’ve ever heard.
Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?|Really? I’ve heard better.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.|I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!|You’re a little high maintenance.
Ahhh! You are on my list.|I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.
. All right you’re off my list.|
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Hey, buddy boy, how’d the audition go?
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Not good, no. I didn’t get the part, and I lost my job here, so …
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Wow! That is a bad audition.
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|How-how did you lose your job here?
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you’ve been working here two days? That’s not, that’s not right.
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Yeah, what are ya gonna do?
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Joey, you can’t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I’m not going to let him get away with that. I’m going to say something to him—No, I really shouldn’t say anything—No, I should say something to him.  Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him…
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Okay.
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|What?
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|He can have his job back.
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|That’s right, he can have his job back. I’m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|That’s great. Thanks Rach.
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who’s a pushover?
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Rach, you’re in my seat.
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Oh, I’m sorry.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.|I pick you, Phoebe.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.|Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.|Hey.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.|Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.|No way.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.|I’m not answering that.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.|Joey!  No way. I’m not answering that.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.|Sherry Bilsing & Ellen Plummer
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.|Seth Kurland
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that’s  $12.75.|This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that’s  $12.75.|Hi!
Hi!|How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.|Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him—He says it’s okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!|Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever!|Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever!|Yeah Joey that is so gross!
How about a scone on the house baby?|I’m pretty.
Hey does anyone have any gum?|Oh I do!  I know it’s in here somewhere.
Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?
Hey!|Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can’t work if I’m sick.
Hey!|Ohh!
Hey!|I’m so sorry you’re sick.
Hey!|I’m not sick!! I don’t get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
Hey!|Honey, no one thinks you’re a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
Hey!|
Hey!|I’m gonna grab you some tissue.
Hey!|I don’t need a tissue! I’m fine-d!
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|Yes?
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister.
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|Oh my God, Jill!
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|Oh my God, Rachel!
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|Oh my God, introduce us!
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|This is Chandler.
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|Hi!
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|And you know Monica and Ross!
Hi Jill.|And that’s Phoebe , and that’s Joey.
Hi Jill.|Hey,  how you doin’?
Hi Jill.|Don’t!!  Honey, what are you doing here?!
Hi Jill.|Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that’s bitter?
Hi Jill.|Daddy cut me off.
Hi Jill.|Never mind, I got it.
Hi Jill.|And y’know what I said to him? "I’m gonna hire a lawyer and I’m gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I’m gonna cut you off!"
Hi Jill.|Wow! What did he say?
Hi Jill.|That he wouldn’t pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he’s actually proud off.
Hi Jill.|Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad’s proud of me! My dad’s proud of me.
Hi Jill.|Rach?
Hi Jill.|Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
Hi Jill.|Okay, I bought a boat.
Hi Jill.|You bought a boat?
Hi Jill.|Yeah but it wasn’t for me, it was for a friend.
Hi Jill.|Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
Hi Jill.|Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could’ve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I’m the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you’re gonna do. You’re gonna get a job, you’re gonna get an apartment, and then I’ll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
Hi Jill.|Of course, yeah!
Hi Jill.|Oh, that’s so great! Okay, I’m really gonna do this! I don’t know how to thank you guys.
Hi Jill.|Ooh, I like cards.
Are you all finished here?|Yes.
Great!|Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
What?!|For all the free food you gave away.
Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?|We don’t give anything away unless it’s someone’s birthday.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?|No!
|
|Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
|Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got!  And these are my, "Don’t you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
|I don’t think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
|Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
|Seriously, I don’t Rachel’s gonna think it’s a good idea.
|So who made her queen of the world?
|I would love that job!
|Hey! What’s goin’ on?
|Hey!
|Jill! Did you shop?!
|No! They did!
|Yeah, we went shopping!
|You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill’s nose when you know she’s trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
|Sorry Jill.
|Sorry-sorry Jill.
|What’d you get?
|Oh well, all right, I got
|Oh.
|And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
|Apartment pants?
|Yeah, you never heard of them?
|No, of course, of course I’ve heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
|Huh? Oh, I got this——this!
|A pajmena?
|Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
|Really?
|Ross, wants a pajmena?
|It’s a rug.
|Jill?
|I’m sorry Rachel, I’m sorry…
|Oh, come on! You think that’s gonna work on me?! I invented that!
|Right! But, I am sorry.
|All right, it’s okay. One little setback is okay, just don’t let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I’m just gonna take the-the pajmena.
|She took all my stuff.
|Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
|thank you so much!
|Well. Hey…
|Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
|Oh yeah, how about you and the,  "I’m sorry!"
|Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
|What about, what about when I said y’know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
|Were you this cute in high school?
|Oh stop.
|No you stop!
|No, you stop!
|You stop!
|Okay-okay, why don’t I sit here and you’ll both stop it!
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something crazy!|I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me.|That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here.
|Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.
|Don’t take this personally okay? It’s just that I just can’t have sex with a sick person.
I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.|That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Hey!|Hey.
What’s up?!|Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.
Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.|No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
What?!|Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
With Ross and Jill?|Yeah!
With Ross and my sister?|Yeah.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?|Yeah.
Oh there is no way.|Okay then.
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.|But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
That’ll be $3.85.|What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
It’s just I can’t because my manager said I…  "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie…|Amy!
"…Amy! Happy birthday to you!"|Hey, that’s weird, today’s my birthday too!
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Sorry I’m late, what’s up?
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Oh hi! Y’know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn’t go in. How strong am I?
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|That is great. Hey, y’know who doesn’t have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Yeah.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you’re gonna go out?
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|I just, Phoebe, said y’know thought she saw something between you guys.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|No! I mean he’s nice.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Yeah.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|He’s the kind of guy you’re friends with, y’know? But he’s not the kind of guy you date. He’s the kind of guy you’d date because you did. Me, not so much.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Oh no-no-no, he’s just I don’t know, he’s just a little bookish.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Are-are you saying he’s a geek?
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|You think so too?
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Fine, then let’s just say he’s not my type.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren’t on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I’ll ask him out.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that’s not what I meant.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|No! Y’know what Rachel? You’re right, y’know he has been really nice to me.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Yeah but, he’s not your type.
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Yeah but maybe that’s a good thing. Y’know I’m doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Yeah but, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t want to try to much too fast. Y’know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don’t you?
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|What?
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|She-she died Jill.
Chandler!|Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup?  Oh-ohhhh!
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.|Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.|I was asleep.  Oh no! No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.|Would you please get some rest!
"Happy birthday to you!"|You’re paying for that.
What? No-no it’s her birthday!|You’ve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But it really…|You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damnit!|Rach? Hi!
Damnit!|Hi!
Damnit!|Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
Damnit!|Well yeah…
Damnit!|Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she’s cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
Damnit!|Really?!
Damnit!|Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
Damnit!|Oh so-so not really never.
Damnit!|I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we’ve been through, I just—y’know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
Chandler, I think I’m sick.|Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?|No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Come on! I really need your help!|No-no-no-no-no!
Fine, I’ll rub it on myself.|Okay.
Fine, I’ll rub it on myself.|So you’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
Yeah?|It’s nice.
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?|Yes!
I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?|It’s all very, very good.  So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Not now, I’m sick!|Oh come on you big faker!
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?|Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex…|Okay!
Hi!|Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?|Well, I-I don’t like it.
Really?!|It’s kinda slutty.
It’s yours!|Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.
Me too.|Hi Jill!
Hey!|Hi .
Hey!|Rachel.
Hey!|Rachel! Well, you-you’re not at home, you’re-you’re-you’re right here.
Hey!|Yeah I know, and I bet you thought it would be weird. But it’s not!
Hey!|Okay. So well I’ll umm,  I’ll have her home by midnight.
Why aren’t you home yet?!|Is someone there?
Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!|What are you doing here?
Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?|We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.|Is that your sister?
Ugh, she is a slut!|God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!|He’s taking off her coat!
Oh, this is just terrible.|Oh no it’s not, no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure that nothing is gonna…
Oh.|Ho-oh, he’s gonna get some!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh… Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh, I’m eating their food. What are you doing?|Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!|Joey we know you steal our food.
Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!|I’m good.
Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!|Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!|Yeah. And y’know who should’ve shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!|Is that a swing?
Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!|Oh don’t even ask!
Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!|Yuck!
I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.|That was like 5 years ago.
Yeah you got 5 years left!|Joey…
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!|Hey!
So how was your big date last night?|Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?|I guess so.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!|No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh, slides.  So really nothing happened.|Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Right. Was it the, "Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"|Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
She asked-asked you out again?|Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it.|It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her again.
Thank you. I…yeah.|I mean after tomorrow night.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can’t! I can’t do it!  It’s just gonna freak me out!!!|Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore.
Ross thanks.|You want me to call her right now?
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you?|Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
This is my favorite part.|Yeah me too.
This is my favorite part.|Oh y’know what’s sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
This is my favorite part.|Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
This is my favorite part.|You didn’t cry when Bambi’s mother died?
This is my favorite part.|Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time.|I’m not macho.
Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.|No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.
Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.|Come on man there’s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.|I’d be sad sure, but I wouldn’t cry.
Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.|Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.|Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I’m rich!
Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it!  Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!|All right, what’s going on there?
Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it!  Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!|Oh, that’s Parent’s Day, first grade. That’s me with the janitor Martin.
Where were your parents?|Oh they didn’t want to come!
Where were your parents?|Oh Chandler!
Poor thing!|So that story doesn’t make you cry?
Poor thing!|No! Look, I don’t cry! It’s not a big deal! Okay?!
Poor thing!|No! It’s not okay! It’s not okay at all!! You’re dead inside!!
Excuse me.|Yeah?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?|Yeah.
Can-can I get your autograph, I’m your biggest fan.|Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi!
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you’re really talented.|You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan.
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you’re really talented.|So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?
I have no idea what you’re talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay’s autograph!|Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan!
Oh yeah! I’ve seen all her movies.|Movies?
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.|I don’t think so.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t gonna believe this!|Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star!
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t gonna believe this!|Well, I wouldn’t call her a star, but she’s really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
Hey!|Hey!
You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn’t even tell me why!|Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work.|It’s not random, it’s Bob.
It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!|No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
You asked him too?!|Hm-mmm.
Why?!|Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…
I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?|No.
You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him?|Y’know Bob in Human Resources…
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was!  You had me doubting my fashion sense!|Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just…
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.|I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Why are you so jealous of me?|Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!
Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is dairy!|All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Who?!|In Human Resources!!!!!!
…I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!|You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?
Do I have my own castle?|Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she?
No.|Oh great! Did you get a movie?
No.|Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don’t think it’s the kind you’re gonna like.
No.|You didn’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
No.|Sort of…
No.|Guys, what’s going on?
No.|Phoebe’s a porn star!
No.|What?!!
No.|Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
Oh my God!|That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Oh my God!|Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
Oh my God!|And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn’t know he was in there.
Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.|This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.
Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.|Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don’t do porn.
Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.|Yes, but you are dead inside.
Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.|All right well, I’d better take that back.
Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.|Wh-what, why?
Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.|We can’t watch that! I mean that’s Phoebe!
Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.|Yeah you’re right, we can’t—we shouldn’t watch this.
Absolutely not.|Y’know maybe a little bit!
Probably just the first half.|No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not gonna watch it!
Probably just the first half.|Yeah! Good for you Joe!
Probably just the first half.|Yeah.
Probably just the first half.|Ah, I thought I’d find you here, Nasforatool.
Probably just the first half.|Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
Probably just the first half.|Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
Probably just the first half.|Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
Probably just the first half.|Her ankle is what you’re watching?
Well it’s hard to tell…  Oh God, if she would just stop moving.|She’s just doing her job!
Well it’s hard to tell…  Oh God, if she would just stop moving.|You sick bastards!
Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!|Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!|Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
Hey sweetie!|Hey!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?|There’s no back to this couch!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.|Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.
Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.|Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it!|No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this.
I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.|Yeah?
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.|Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside.|Aww, I love you so…
What is wrong with you?!!!|What?!
What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!|So you didn’t mean any of that?!
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to…  Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?|Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’s just that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Of course, what happened?|I don’t want to talk about it.
Okay, umm…|But you know what might really cheer me up?
What?|Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Wow! Really?!|Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!|Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend!
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.|No, I haven’t.
Who is it?|It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey!|Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
No I’m not.|We’re still rolling!
No I’m not.|You’re making one right now!
No I’m not.|Let’s go Phoebe!
No I’m not.|And-and you’re using my name!
Yeah, can I help you with something?|Phoebe, come on!
Yeah, can I help you with something?|Look, I’m talking right now! You’re—you mean her.
Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.|What?!
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.|No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you!
Slides are almost ready.|Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.|Oh great!
Hello?|What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.|Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!|Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye.  Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.|So?
Hey!|Hey!
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.|Oh no, not you too!
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.|Nice!
Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.|That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star?
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.|You do?
Yeah.  See?|Yeah.
Hey.|You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Hey.|Oh! I knew it! What happened?
Hey.|Umm, she kissed me.
Hey.|What?! You kissed!
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Shhhh!!!
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Well, it doesn’t sound like it! I mean, it’s pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don’t kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn’t stop it. I guess I-I just wasn’t thinking…
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Yeah that’s right you weren’t thinking! Y’know what? Let me give you something to think about!
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Oh wait—hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister’s mouth long enough to tell me that.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|What?!
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|No, I mean, look I don’t know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don’t want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Wow. I, I don’t even know what to say. Thank you.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|You’re welcome.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel!|Yeah, I got that.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?|You take care Jill.
|Bye-bye-e!
|Bye.
|I can’t help it, I opened a gate.

Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!|Oh my God!
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!|Wow!
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!|What is the matter with you?!
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!|No! Barry and Mindy.
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!|Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross.  Who-who’s Barry and Mindy?
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.|Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.|Why did they get divorced?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|Which time?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|Sure I would!
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|No, I just think Monica was that fat.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!  Oh-hey, there’s Carol again!
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie.
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|What?!
Merrill Lynch?|Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Well why didn’t you take the job?|Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Well why didn’t you take the job?|Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?
Oh my God! Rachel Green?|Rob Tillman!
No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!|Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.
No, no-no, Ross Geller.|Ohh, of course Monica’s brother!
Yeah. Right.|Wow! How are you?!
Good-good, I’m-I’m married.|Ohh! Me too!
Is-isn’t it the best?|Oh, it’s the best!  So, umm how’s Monica?
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.|Ohh, I would love too.
Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!|Ohh! Okay!
Come on!|Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?
No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…|Oh yeah? Okay.
Okay.|But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?|He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?|
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?|Thanks.
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?|Yeah. Y’know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it’s a seed.
Wow!!|Can anyone else name a well known seed that’s been masquerading as a nut?
Oh dear God, let me think.|Hey.
Hey.|Oh no! What’s the matter?
Hey.|Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
Hey.|Y’know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
Hey.|Okay.
Hey.|Okay.
Hey.|Bye.
Hey.|Bye-bye.
Hey.|Was his question what’s more boring than him?
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?|Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?|Ehh.
Really?|Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
That’s an idea!  Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?|No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!|I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!|Okay!

Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?|Yes!!
Then yes that is what I’m having.|Oh my God!
Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.|Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.|Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down.
Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.|I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die!  But you’re not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.|Let’s take a walk.
Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.|So what’s going on with you?
Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.|Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Yeah.|How long has it been since you had sex?
Well, last weekend…|Oh that’s not so bad.
…will be two months…|That is.
…since I stopped trying.|Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
What-what do you mean?|I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…
Oh.|Y’know, dirty talk, m�nage � trois, toys…
Wow!|Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Okay, I think I got it.|Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching!  It never happened.
Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey?|Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I’m with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I’m lost and I can’t find food."
Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey?|Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
Yeah! She’s right in there!|Oh great.  Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
All right, and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.|Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment.  And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!|Hey!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?|Wow! Umm, y’know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn’t.
Why?  Why can’t the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?|Isn’t that a line from the show?!
Uh, yeah but uh,  I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.|That’s a line from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.|
Thanks!|Yeah?
I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay?|I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude.  Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.|Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Iced tea.|Okay, anything for you sir?
Did I not just tell him?|Yes, you did.
You’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya?|It’s not all juice!
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.|Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.|What do you mean?
Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working…|
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!|Yay!
Yay!  Seriously, our sex life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun?|Like what?
Well I don’t know umm,  Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.|I love that idea!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!|Oh my God! That’s great! Oh wow!  You’re a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Aww.|Wait a minute!  My last Kit-Kat bar!
You wanna share it?|Okay!!
You wanna share it?|Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you’re mad, but I just want to say I’m sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y’know? I mean, y’know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise?
You wanna share it?|It’s not mayonnaise!!
You wanna share it?|Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. Here.
What’s this?|Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Aww, thanks man.|Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Aww, thanks man.|Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?!
Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.|Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.|Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?|Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!|Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!|Well, you’re not.
Oh, it’s so easy for you I mean, you’re not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!|Yeah I can!
Monica. You’ve, you’ve done it right?|Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?
Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!|Say it louder, I don’t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!|Yeah, I heard it.
Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!|It’s not like, I haven’t any opportunities. I mean, y’know, I’m just waiting for the perfect guy. I’m seeing this guy Roger, all right? He’s not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y’know, give him my flower.
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you’ve waited long enough!!|Y’know what? You are right?!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever…|Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!|Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!|No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Put it out!!|Okay! Okay!  I’m so glad you’re here.
Put it out!!|Come on.  I got it.
Put it out!!|Oh, give it to me.
Put it out!!|I got it!
Put it out!!|Give it!
Put it out!!|
Put it out!!|Was it my work? Were they mad? Was it Jack? Did he yell?!
Put it out!!|J-j-just relax, nobody yelled. Jack just was calling to make sure that you were getting better.
Put it out!!|Thank God.
Put it out!!|Yeah, she’s fired.
You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.|Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.|Not so fast Wesley!
You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.|Remoray!
You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.|That’s right Wesley! I just stopped by to say that, you’re not a real doctor! And that woman’s brain, is fine!
You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.|Oh! Thank God!
Hope! Hope!|Drake!
You’re not dying Hope, you’re gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.|Oh Drake.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find…|Ooh, actually I’ve been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Oh.|Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so…
Oh, I know.  Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda…|Oh, me too.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben’s asleep.|Oh umm, y’know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Hey, Pheebs!|Hey.
Hey, how’s it going?|Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy!
Hey, how’s it going?|Here you go sweetie.
Hey, how’s it going?|What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
Hey, how’s it going?|But, I put some honey in it.
She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?|No, the doctors say it may kill her.
She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?|What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?|But I think we should tell her.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.|Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.|Listen Phoebe, he’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.|I know! But if I didn’t work there, what else would I do?
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.|Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.|Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.|Uh, what about y’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.|Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change—ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!|I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!|Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will!  Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!|Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?|It’s uh, right through there.
Okay.  God y’know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…|Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?
I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. And y’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?|They have parasites?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.|What people?
People! People say it! Come here!|So oysters, huh?
And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.|Y’know, it’s funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases…
No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!|Ohh! Didn’t know! Okay!
Okay!  Ohhh no!|I’m sorry sweetie, it’s the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
We’re really gonna do this, huh?|Looks like it.
Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at…|I got it!
Okay.|
Okay.|Hey!
Okay.|Thank you so much for coming.
Okay.|Oh, I wouldn’t miss it for the world.
I’m-I’m Ross by the way.|I love what you’ve done with this space.
I’m-I’m Ross by the way.|Thank you so much.
I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.|Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like he’s here.|Stop it!! That’s not funny!!
Okay.|I’m sorry, okay? It just—tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
What was tonight?|You don’t want to know what tonight was.
Okay.  What was tonight?|Well, tonight was—was going to be my first time.
With Roger?  Oh my God!|All right relax Mr. I’ve Had Sex Four Times!
Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!|How many?
Nine.|I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?|No. He’s not a horrible guy.
Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.|Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.|Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Okay.|I was kidding.
Joey, you’re such an amazing actor!  How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?|Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Wow! Tell me something Joey——Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.|Yeah you did.
Okay.|Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Yeah?|When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands.|Come, come here.
We can’t do this.|No!  Oyster?
Yeah!  If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.|Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible, how would I know?
I do like that.|It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?|Absolutely! It would just be one friend
Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!|Noo!! Okay!!
Okay!|Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
I have some moves.|I have no moves.  Oh y’know what? I’m sorry, this is just too weird.
Yeah, let’s just forget it.|What if I turn out the lights?
Oh yeah.|Chandler?
Yeah?|That’s the couch.
Oh my God!|I know! I’ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Morning!|Oh right.
Yeah.|Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.|Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t, we didn’t uhh…
No! No! No, not after seeing that.|God I’m just a horrible person.
Wh-why?|Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!
That’s ridiculous! I’m not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.|Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…|The ring from the cave, yeah.
Wow! Uh okay, well uh…|Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.|No! No-no-no…
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.|But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!|Yeah!
Hey!|Hey!
Look at you! You’re up!|All right!
Look at you! You’re up!|I thought I’d try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I’ll be back soon.
Look at you! You’re up!|Whoa-whoa-whoa! You’re not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
Look at you! You’re up!|No. I’ve learned my lesson.
Look at you! You’re up!|Let’s go! Come on! Move it!
Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?|Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man, but I….
No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.|You?
Yeah!|Wow!
Yeah!|All right! So, was it amazing?
It was, it was okay.|Just okay—Did you do it right?!
Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?"|Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?
It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.|But you got to be with both of them, right?
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.|Not the other one?
No, she kept kicking me away!|Yeah, you don’t want that.
No!|Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Oh I a lot of stuff!|You got a little bored?
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.|Yeah? What did ya have?
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard…|Sounds good.
Hey!|Hey!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!|Hey, check me out, I’m a slut!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?|Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when…|Are you okay?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?|Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I’m all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
I bet he can.|Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?
Ohh! My God! Barry!!|You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Surprise! Look who’s back!|Hey Pheebs!
Hey!|Pheebs, didn’t you get fired?
Uh, I don’t think so!|Phoebe?
Jack!! Hey!|What are you doing here?
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?|Well, you were fired.
Nu-uh!|I told that guy who answered your phone.
Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count—Anyway, I’ll be in my office.|Uh, Phoebe you-you don’t have an office.
That’s all right, I’ll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.|Phoebe, listen…
You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake…|You lost 13 million dollars.
Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that—Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!|Are you all right?
I’m having another heart attack!|What?!
I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!|Take it easy.
Dumbass!|Hey Pheebs! How’s it going?!
Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack.|Wow! Well, welcome back!
Hi Ross!|Hey Rachel.
Is Joey Tribbiani here?|Umm, no.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!|That-that’s always good news. Are you okay?
Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!! But, you know who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!|Yeah.
Sit down!|Okay.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!|We’re sorry.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?|Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?
Aw what are you?! A detective?|Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Oh.|Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Who are these men?|Men. I guy I know.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.|She is not…  She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this.
Good day for married people huh?|I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.|Try telling my wife that.
Okay to come in?|Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?|What?!
I’m the ruptured spleen.|Why would you do that?
Because you shouldn’t be with him.  You should be with me.|Really?
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend.|Chandler!
I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a "doctor…"|There was just one woman, wasn’t there?
No, there were two.|Including me?
|Adam Chase
|Zachary Rosenblatt
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?|Yeah.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?|Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?|Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?|Y’know what’s more generous than that?! Fifty percent! Y’know what’s even more generous than that?!!
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?|I see where you’re goin’!
What’s up with the greed Joe?|All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?!
Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?|Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this  goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|Ah, finally an explanation.
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|No-no! I used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember? Let’s see uh, well I don’t want to donate sperm again.  Ooh-ooh, maybe they want like some of my blood or-or spit or something, huh?
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|Joey!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|Yeah?
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|What did I tell you about talking to your friends while you’re working?
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|Uhh do it?
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|That guy
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|Well, where was I?
Hi!|Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?|Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Wow!|Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
Wow!|Takes it out of you?
Wow!|Now, we can kick anybody’s ass!
Wow!|Yeah!
After one class? I don’t think so.|What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there  and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call  unagi.|Isn’t that a kind of sushi?
No, it’s a concept!|Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!
All right, maybe it means that too…|Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!|Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!|You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi.|Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Y’know what…|Hey-hey, is Monica here?
Y’know what…|No.
No.|Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.
No.|Well, Valentine’s Day was like two weeks ago, so I wouldn’t get her a calendar!
No.|She was working on Valentine’s Day so we’re celebrating it tonight.
No.|Ohh, hey! Why don’t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?
No.|Ooh, Joey, that’s actually a really good idea!
No.|And of course, crotchless panties.
No.|Well appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend  I can’t do that we promised we’d make each other gifts this year.
No.|Aw, I love that.
No.|You guys!
No.|You can’t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut…
No.|Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.
No.|Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut.
No.|Oh, I love paper mache! What did you make?
No.|I made a…
No.|What is that?
No.|Nothing!
So what are you gonna do?|Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
So what are you gonna do?|Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies!  Oh for crying out loud!
So what are you gonna do?|Hey, wait a minute! That is my sock!
So what are you gonna do?|Now, it’s you little bunny friend.
|Hey!
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?|Oh, yeah.
Do we have to make the entire thing?|Yes! Why, did you—you forget to make yours?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.|Okay.  I can’t believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
What?|I’m just so excited to make the presents!  Shoot!
Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids.|We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we’re not looking for applicants right now.
Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?|Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up.
Thanks.|Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It’s a twins study.
But it’s $2,000.|Sorry.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.|We already got the results back on that on, and they’re not good.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!|Ross!!!
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!|What the hell was that?!
A lesson in the importance of unagi.|Ohh, you’re a freak!!
Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?|All right, so we weren’t prepared!
Hey.|Chandler. I sensed it was you.
What?!|Unagi. I’m always aware.
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?|What’s up?
I can’t figure out what to make Monica.|Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.
I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?|Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this.  Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.|Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.|Why not?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.|Oh.
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.|DANGER!!!!!
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.|Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?|Sure! Okay, you go first.
Okay, come here! Come here.|Okay!
Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.|Okay.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.|Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!|Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Okay!|Okay, you ready to open yours?
Yeah!|Okay.
It’s a sock bunny.|Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Not really.|Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that’s what this is about.
I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.|No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents!
Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…|No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just… You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y’know I’m just gonna—I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here
Wow!  You are way to young to have seen that!|Oops!  Y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.|We have got to wash that!
Yeah!|Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
You have done enough!|I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.|Oop, your cake is ready!
Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.|Hey Mon! Hey Chann!
Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.|Who the hell are you?!
Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.|I’m Joey! How are you doin’?!
Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.|
Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.|Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.
Who the hell is Carl?!|Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?|Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is…
Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?|The only problem!
Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?|Yeah, he’s the reason I didn’t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.
Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?|Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?
Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?|
Pat Sajak?|Yep!
Alex Trebek?|Oh, of course!
Chuck Woolery?|Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who’s ass I cannot kick.
Say it!|Say we are unagi!
Say it!|It’s not something you are! It’s something you have!
Say it!|Y’know what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!
All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?|Another Minute Maid fiasco.
That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?|Well, I’m not gonna talk because…
|
That’s us.|But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
That’s right, $2,000.|But, you’re not identical twins.
Oh my good God.|Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.|I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape.|The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Oh, the mixed tape.|You are just the sweetest.
Oh, the mixed tape.|I love the way you look every night Chandler!  That’s why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!
Okay ladies, that ends today’s class, and let’s remember, let’s be safe out there.|It’s a great class.
Thanks.|Yeah, yeah, I was watching.  Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them…|No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Who? Me the attacker?|Yes that’s right.
Why?|I tired attacking two women, did not work.
What?!|No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!|Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together?  That-that’s a no.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!|Uh-huh.
And I will cook anything you want in here|And, are you kiddin’ me?!
Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?|Okay.
Okay.|My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
So, are we going in there?|I am!!
So, are we going in there?|

I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over…|Why is Ross doing that?
I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over…|DANGER!!!!
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!|We should help him!
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"|Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh?
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"|Who wrote it?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.|Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Yeah.|Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer.
Yeah.|A hot girl’s at stake and all of the sudden he’s Rain Man.
Yeah.|Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.|Oh, is that against the rules?
No, but it is frowned upon.|I see.
Besides, there’s a big age difference.|Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…
I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.|No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?|Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?|What’s a Movement class?
Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?|It’s Chandler’s way of pretending he didn’t take mime.
Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!|Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!|You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred…
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?|Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try.
All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?|Yeah so, Tuesday?
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!|Thank you.
Okay.|Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.
Okay.|You just thought of that in there?
Okay.|Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
Okay.|Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
Okay.|You’re on the phone!
Okay.|That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
Okay.|Oh my God! How bad was it?
Okay.|Well, he didn’t say, but it was a fire. I’m guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
Okay.|Come on!
Okay.|What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
|Professor Geller?
|Yeah?
|I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
|Oh thank you. Thanks very much.
|Uh, I’m a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation…
|That was you?
|Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You’re a teacher. I’m a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
|Oh I, I don’t-I don’t think that would be the best idea.
|Oh, because I was thinking, the semester’s over; you’re not my teacher anymore.
|What time?
|Oh, y’know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
|Gotcha.
|I’m kidding!
|Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
Coming through!  No! Right! Coming through!|Oh well, it’s not so bad.
Coming through!  No! Right! Coming through!|Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
Oh!|My God!
Oh!|Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
Oh!|Excuse me?
Oh!|Joey! He’s working!  You would look good in that.
Oh!|Oh, how bad is it?
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|How’s your room Rach?
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|Everything’s ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|Isn’t that mine?
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|Fine! I’m sorry for your loss!
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|So uh, you’re not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|Yes, they can stay with us.
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|Well uh, do either of you smoke?
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.|No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!|Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay?  I warned her about those candles.
God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!|Chandler, is that…
Oh that’s great! Good for you.|Hey-hey listen…
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm…  What?!|When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
|Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time?
Hi.|Hey!
We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.|Ah-ha!
We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.|Wow! So, now you’re going on a date with this girl?
Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.|You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
No, we only went out once.|You dated her!
Not once!|All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Not once!|Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business.|Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie.
My friend’s name is Joey.|Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y’know I-I-I haven’t spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.|No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve huh?|Yeah!
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?|Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.|Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.|Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one’s fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.|Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.|Okay!
So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.|I have.
This right here is where I keep the pizza.|What’s that smell?
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!|What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?|Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?|Umm, no. No.
Yes you did! What was it?|Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.
Ohh that’s so sweet!|Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.
Ohh that’s so sweet!|Dr. Geller!
Ohh that’s so sweet!|Burt!
So did you sleep well last night?|I did.
Yeah?|I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?|What?
Gum!|Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!|No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It’s looks like a curling iron.
I don’t use a curling iron.|Well someone does.
I don’t use a curling iron.|Well, don’t look at me! My hair’s straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
I don’t use a curling iron.|It could’ve been a hair straightener.
I don’t use a curling iron.|Oh.
Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!|Thanks Monica!
Does that smell bother you?|What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.|I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Okay!|Okay.
Hello?  It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector.|Oh!  Really?!
We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age.  A concept lost on some people!|So it’s okay to date a student.
Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.|Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What-what should I do?|Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Yeah. What-what should I do?|Joey that is so sweet.
Yeah. What-what should I do?|Hey.
Yeah. What-what should I do?|Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
Yeah. What-what should I do?|I couldn’t do it.
Yeah. What-what should I do?|You couldn’t do it?!
Yeah. What-what should I do?|Hey, relax I just need more time. We’re going to dinner tonight.
Yeah. What-what should I do?|What?! You’re going out with her again!
Going out with who?|Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh…|No, that was Dana Caplin.
Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh…|Ohhhh!
Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh…|Joey! You didn’t even know her!
Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh…|Ah whatever!
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!|Y’know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!|Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that way about you.
Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!|I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
No-no—Really?!|Of course!
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…|Ohh, I’m sorry.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.|What?! Anything! Anything!
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?|Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Hey! How’s it goin’?|Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes it has! I made cookies!|Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.|Okay.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!|Okay, I’ll be out in a second.
What are you doing?|That doesn’t lock does it?
Oh, Joey! Sorry!|No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!|Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
Really?|Yeah! Look!
I’ve never lived like this before.|I know.
I’ve never lived like this before.|All right, don’t waste it, I mean its still food.
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?|Uhh, I can’t.
Oh, you have some studying to do?|No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to…|What are you doing?
Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!|Do you not want to be seen with me?
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?|Uh no, they’re still here but I think I’m about to leave.
What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on.  Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.|Hi!
What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on.  Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.|Aren’t you in my Popular Culture class?
That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.|You are so fired.
What?|They’re gonna fire you! You can’t date a student! It’s against the rules.
I love it at Joey’s!|Hey, here you go.
I love it at Joey’s!|Ni-hi-ice!
Thanks!|So, you busy Thursday?
Thanks!|Oh, very funny. I don’t know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday.
Thanks!|Okay. Okay.  What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
Thanks!|Hey! Hi!
Hi!|Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
Uh-huh.|Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.|Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.|Really?
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.|Yeah she said something about crumbies.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.|No! No! No! I was so careful!
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.|Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.|That’s right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey’s.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!|No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
I know. I’m sorry.|All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
I know. I’m sorry.|Yeah.
I know. I’m sorry.|God, what a mess.
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.|For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.

Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.|Well, actually it’s been great. She’s 20 so she’s not looking for anything too serious, which is perfect for me right now.
Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.|Well that is great. And seriously, she seems very nice.
Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.|Thanks. I know you guys like to give me a hard time and all, but it really means a lot to me that you like her. Just knowing that you guys are…

Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?|Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?|Hey!
Hey!|Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Hey!|Oh that’s so funny because we found someone too.
Hey!|Oh that’s good, I guess she’ll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.
Hey!|Why would our guy be a weirdo?
Hey!|‘Cause that’s just your taste.
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.|Oh yeah?
Yeah!|My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
Yeah!|A face ass?
Yeah!|A chin dimple!
Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!|Have you seen your guy’s body?
Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!|No, our guy is just a floating head.
Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!|Well my guy is spectacular. Okay? He’s a massage client and one time umm, when he was on the table, I looked at it. And I mean all of it.

That’s still in there?!|Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Is this a service you’re providing me?|No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!
Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.|So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Uh-huh.|And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Okay…|Give me $400!
Professor Geller?|Hmm?  Oh, a student I don’t know.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?|Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Making out in your office.|Shh!  Of course, why don’t we go inside?
Making out in your office.|Oh-ooh!
What?|Doorknob! Doorknob!
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.|Oh, okay. What-what about?
Spring vacation.|Spring vacation.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips…|Professor Geller!
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips…|
You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?|Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?|Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?|Or! You can just, y’know…
What the hell are you doing?|What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!|Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!  Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!

What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!|You pushed him!
Joey, I did not break this! Okay?  That has been broken for a while.|All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Joey, I did not break this! Okay?  That has been broken for a while.|Uh-huh.
Joey, I did not break this! Okay?  That has been broken for a while.|I still haven’t gotten a check for your half yet.
Do not give him any money!|I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?|Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?|Oo-oo!
Doorknob?|Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Oh good.|Look, I…  Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to Florida for a couple weeks.|No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…
You are so adorable.|That! Let’s talk about that.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey! How did it go with Elizabeth?
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.|Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
What’s-what’s the difference?|Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.
Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.|What did you do on yours?
I went to Egypt with my dad.|I can see it now, "Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!"
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!"  All right? I mean she’s taken my class!|And slept with the professor.
I’m gonna call her.|Yeah.
I’m gonna call her.|Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.
I’m gonna call her.|Hi.

I’m gonna call her.|Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandler’s work!
I’m gonna call her.|Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.
I’m gonna call her.|Well, y’know what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think I’m just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.

I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!|Yeah, y’know what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy you’d like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?"  "Uhh, okay—I gotta go!"
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!|All right guys stop it. Rachel, we’re very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And y’know what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!|Yeah! What have you got to lose? Y’know you might even end up with someone really special  if you pick my guy.
All right.|Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Yes, I’ll meet ‘em.|Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.

It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.|Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30.
Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.|Ross, it’s going to be okay. I’m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.

Okay. Cool.|Oh hey! Here they are!
Okay. Cool.|Elizabeth!

That is lucky.|Well, don’t get your hopes up, because probably not gonna happen.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?|I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?|I am.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?|Joey, what are you talking about? You’re a terrific actor.
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?|You really think so?
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?|Ugh, how can you even ask that question?!
Whoa, she's pretty.|Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Whoa, she's pretty.|I'm sorry, what?
Whoa, she's pretty.|What?
Whoa, she's pretty.|Excuse me?
Whoa, she's pretty.|It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
Oh, ok.|
I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.|Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!|Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.

It’s your turn.|Oh, are we playing this?!
It’s your turn.|Hey.
It’s your turn.|Hey! How’d the audition go?
It’s your turn.|Terrible! I messed up every line! I shouldn’t even be an actor!
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?|Yeah, did I fool ya?
Totally!|So it did go well.
Totally!|Oh, it went amazingly well!
Great!|Oh that’s great!
Great!|Yeah-yeah, it’s down to me and two other guys.
Great!|Oh my God!
Wow!|And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…
Oh, I love that guy!|Oh-oh, what are you doing?
What am I doing?|I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
What am I doing?|Well, it is overdue.
Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.|There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.|Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.|Don't, I like it dirty.
That's your call.|So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.|Are they, uh, firm?
They'r alright.|You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
No really, they're OK.|You gonna slice them up real nice?
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.|Aaaahhhhhhh.
Well, what happened?|Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Well, what happened?|Ohhhhhh!
Well, what happened?|Oh my God!
Well, what happened?|And all of the sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
Was it...|Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
You ate my sandwich?|It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.

So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.|What a nice story!
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.|So Ross was in college and decided to jump at the chance to take a young girl to her high school prom.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|Yeah, take your time.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasn’t as bad as-as…
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|Ross, look, I know I’ve been giving you a lot of jabs and it’s partly because I’m very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many,  all bad.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|Not all bad.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|And anyhow, I’m sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I  still look at Lizzie like she’s a twelve-year-old girl.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|I beg your pardon?
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|No! No! Not—I don’t mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, who’s umm six and I still think of him as a baby.
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|You have a son?
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|Yeah, well my-my ex-wife and I share custody of Ben and umm, uh, and just so you know, Carol and I are on excellent terms as I’m sure you are with your wife!  It’s unbelievable!
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|Don’t worry about it, I just didn’t realize you were married.
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.|You’re back.
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.|You two were married?!
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.|We said seven!
We said six!|The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!"|Hi!
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!"|Oh my good God.
Ugh!|I know what time you said.
Ugh!|What?!
Ugh!|Well actually, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.
What time?|Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the rescue, huh?  Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.

What time?|So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
What time?|That’s right.
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!|Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.

I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.|How to make the next one even shorter?
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Y’know what? I-I-I… I-I have had enough of this! Y’know, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if you’ve got a problem with me, frankly…
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Are you yelling at me?!
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|God no!
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Y’know what daddy? If you don’t like Ross, that’s fine. It doesn’t matter to me, I’m gonna go out with him anyway.
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Really?!
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Well if it doesn’t matter to her, it doesn’t matter to me!  Still not yelling!
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Wow. What can I say?  This doesn’t make me like you any better!
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|That’s okay, I’m not so crazy about myself right now either.
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Then we agree?
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Uh yeah, I guess—Yeah! I guess so.
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Neither of us like Ross!
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|I like Ross.
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Ohhh! Kids!
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!|That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now.
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.|The shipment never made it through Omaha?
You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.!  Wayne! Wayne!!|Sherry Bilsing & Ellen Plummer
You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.!  Wayne! Wayne!!|Brian Caldirola
Hi, you guys.|Hey!
Hi, you guys.|Hi!
Hi, you guys.|What’s the matter?
Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.|Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.
No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!|I’ll give up my ticket.
No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!|Me too.
Okay that’s so generous!|And I think Ross is generous too.
Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!|Great.
Yeah.|So what-what is the exhibit.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Oh man!
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Hey!
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Hi!
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Hey!
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Oh that’s great!
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Yeah.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|I mean think about all the money that you’re gonna make!
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Why? What?
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|No, no, that’s funny. But maybe it’s time to move on, let it go, y’know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth’s father, so ah, he’s much older than she is. Looks like I’m not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings  in his ear.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Ross.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Oh, come on you guys; that’s funny! Y’know? Because he’s need—he’s got like a hearing aide y’know, ‘cause-‘cause y’know, ‘cause he’s all old, and…
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I’ve decided to accept the fact that you’re going out with her.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Really? That okay, that’s great.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I’m funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I’m telling you, I don’t want you seeing my daughter anymore.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Yes it does.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don’t think there’s really anything you can do about it.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|I’ll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Ohh! A man with a plan!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!|I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I’ll…
Yeah I know; we’d be great together!|Hey! So I’m back.
Yeah I know; we’d be great together!|Who are you?
Yeah I know; we’d be great together!|Joey Tribbiani! From the wall!  Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I’m ready to go back up on the wall I’m the star of a new TV show.
Yeah I know; we’d be great together!|Show me in the table.
Yeah I know; we’d be great together!|Oh well, it’s not on TV yet.
Yeah I know; we’d be great together!|Well, then it’s not on the wall yet.
Yeah I know; we’d be great together!|Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
Oh, I love museums!|Umm.
Soakin’ up all the culture.|Yeah.
Where do you want to start?|Ooh, the gift shop!
Yeah!|Hey, and then lunch.
Yeah!|Oh, wait yes, but I can’t eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
Yeah!|Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he’s gonna tell you that he’s gay?
Yeah!|What?! No! Why?!
Yeah!|No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
Yeah!|
Yeah!|I didn’t know you could get married here.
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!|May I help you?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!|Oh sorry didn’t mean to interrupt. It’s just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!|Yes. We’re very popular. There’s a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!|Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.|Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.|Yeah hon, it can’t hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you’re not engaged you just don’t use it.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.|I’m gonna do it too!
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.|Me too!
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.|Really? Who would, who would you marry?
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.|I don’t know, I don’t have anyone right now. Y’know?
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.|Oh Pheebs.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.|Don’t feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn’t gay.
Phoebe, that stuff is…|Don’t even get me started on yours!
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?|I did.
All right, let’s get me back up there!|No! It don’t go up on the wall!
What—But you saw the show!|Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Dry cleaners?|Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!|That’s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.|I’ve never seen it!
This place is really beautiful!|Yeah, I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma’s.
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?|Sure!
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?|Are you okay? What’s wrong?
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.|Well, whatever works for ya…
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.|Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it’s kinda fun hiding.
Yeah.|Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.|I’ll just run to the store and get some.
Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it.|Do you know where the store is?
No.|Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
A little bit.|I’ll be back in ten minutes.
Okay.|Why don’t you get in the hot tub and I’ll meet you there.
Ohh, okay.|Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Ohh, okay.|Thank you, it’s my mom’s. So this is the kitchen.
Yeah we are.|
It’s so secluded up here.|I know. I like it up here.
I feel like we’re the only two people in the world.|What’s the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually, would you go check on that?|Honey, we don’t have any bears here.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?|Okay. I’ll be right back.
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!|What are you doing here?!

Get up!|
Ahh. Thank you!|Diet Coke.

Go-go!|Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Ohh, thank you.|I’m so happy that you’re here.
Ohh, thank you.|Here I am!
Ohh, thank you.|Elizabeth! Oh look, Elizabeth’s here! Who are you talking to?
Ohh, thank you.|Uh, you guys?
Ohh, thank you.|How did you know we were here?
Ohh, thank you.|Umm…
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.|Obviously.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.|Elizabeth, what are you doing here?!
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?|Yeah! Yep.
Well, why do y’know go in that room  and do your homework?|Ohh, I wouldn’t do it in there. That’s my dad’s bedroom.
That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom.  That’s your dad’s bedroom!|Why are you yelling?
Hi, honey.|
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!|
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!|Hi, this is Heldi from the Morgan Chase museum. I’m calling for Monica Geller.
Oh no!|I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available…
Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!|
Can I help you?|Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?
He’s not here right now.|Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.|Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?|Oh no-no believe me, I’m leaving as soon as possible!
Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re welcome—How much more homework do you have?|Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re welcome—How much more homework do you have?|Really? Okay. Okay, I-I’ll go upstairs.  If-if you get me something from the car.
What do you need from the car?|Surprise me.
|So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that’s where everybody’s gonna be!
Phoebe!|Yeah?
Have you seen Chandler?!|No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!  I know! How bad is this?!|Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!|What are you gonna do?
Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure!  "Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"|Rachel said that!
Oh! Here it is!|I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!
Oh! Here it is!|Son of a bitch!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.|You, get out of my shop!
Well, what did he do?|He went out with my wife!
Joey!|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife!
Joey!|That’s my wife!!! Get out!
Well, we should go.|Yeah.
Ross? Ross?|Elizabeth!  I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay?
Okay!|Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!
Okay!|Ross!
Okay!|Oh my God Ross! What in heaven’s name are you doing here?
Okay!|And that is why we cannot see each other anymore.
Okay!|Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
Daddy!|You’re next!!
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.|Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.|Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain…
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.|No, let me explain! Fired!!
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.|All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.|What?
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.|And I too am just a love machine.
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.|Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.|I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?|Right here!
Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…|Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.|Okay.
Really?|Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…
I know! I know.|Okay.
I’m gonna go tell Joey that|Hey, did she buy it?
I’m gonna go tell Joey that|Totally.
I’m gonna go tell Joey that|So did Heldi show you the place?
I’m gonna go tell Joey that|Yeah, it’s beautiful.
I’m gonna go tell Joey that|I can’t believe you’re gonna ask Monica to marry you!
I’m gonna go tell Joey that|I know.
Hey Gunther.|Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there  wants the biscotti.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.|Do you still work here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago.  Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry.|Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!|Now, have you told anyone else?
No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.|You told me.
Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.|Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.
Me too.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Oh all right.|Yeah, coffeehouse.
Oh all right.|Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.|How rude.
Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.|Oh, I’m sorry. You wanna bite?
So how are things going with Paul?|Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.|So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.|Hi honey.
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.|Hi!
Watch this.|How are you?
Watch this.|Okay.
Hi Paul!|Hi Phoebe.
So how are things going with you?|Can’t complain.
So how are things going with you?|Come on.
So how are things going with you?|Okay.
So how are things going with you?|Hey!
So how are things going with you?|Hi!
So how are things going with you?|Ross!
So how are things going with you?|Great to see you!
So how are things going with you?|Good to see you too!
So how are things going with you?|How you doing?
So how are things going with you?|Good. Bye!
So how are things going with you?|Okay! You take care!
So how are things going with you?|Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?|Phoebe, why’d you do it?
I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!|What?! Why?!
Please, I think you know why.|I can’t think of anything.
Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.|Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?|I guess it could.
Well then I think that’s it.|Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?|Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
It was fine.|Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.|Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know what——Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Are you talking about having sex?|No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Normal.|Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Nope! That never happened to me!|Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?
Nope.|All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Okay.|Okay.
Okay.|All right.
When I was six years old.|Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.|That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.|Oh!
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn’t really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here  you can see it.|Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Oh, I couldn’t eat now.|What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Chicken?  Chicken boy!|My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring!|Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.|Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring.  I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?|Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring.  I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?|Can I help you?
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.|Or not, whatever.
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.|This ring is from the 1920s, it’s a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?|Okay.  Will you marry me?
Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?|Chandler, I-I will handle this!  How much is it?
Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?|8,600.
Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?|We will give you $10.
Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?|Are you interested in this ring?!
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.|Okay, I can let it go at eight.
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.|We stand firm at $10.
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.|How would you like to pay?
Uh, credit card.  Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.|Okay.  Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Uh, credit card.  Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.|Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
Uh, credit card.  Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.|I’ll give you $1 for them.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?|No.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.|Yeah.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.|Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.|Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.|Here you go.
Oh.|Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go.  Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset.
All the time?|All the time!
Oh my God! Oh my God!!|Still crying?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!|Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
What’s the other one?|I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking.
Oh that’s right. You’re the talker.  Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.|Oh, we have some…
Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara.  What do you think, too much?|A tad.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again.  Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.|Where’s the 1920s princess cut ring.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again.  Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.|I just sold it to that gentleman.
Rachel?|No. How are ya Paul?
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?|No, did he hug you?!
No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.|Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Hey Chandler?|Yeah?
Would you…….Would you hug me?|I’m a little busy here Paul.
That’s exactly what my dad used to say!|Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out.
Five more seconds.|Okay!
Five more seconds.|Hey!
Joey!|Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!
Joey!|Do you have my credit card?
Joey!|Yes, it’s in my… In…in my pocket.  My back pocket! My back pocket!
Joey!|Thank God!
Joey!|Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
Joey!|Oh, I can’t go.
Joey!|Come on! It’ll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and… Paul probably…
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.|Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!|What?
Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!|They put you in jail?
The little jail between the doors!|Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.|Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy.|It was the ring!
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?|No! He blew us off!
What?!|I know!
I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.|Can I tell you something? Me too.
Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!|Ooooh! Freeze him out.
That’s right!|I like it!
Eh? We’ll show him!|From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.  Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Hi. I’m back.|Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I’ve written it all down!
Ah that’s great. No actually that’s…  That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.|Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this!  Y’know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
A lover?|A surfer.
Oh yeah surfer?|I wanted to be one with the waves, y’know?
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh,  get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?|So full of dreams…
I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!|What?! I can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.|Oh Rachel, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to overwhelm you. It’s just that, when those gates open, you…  Hard to close ‘em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared.|I would really like that.
Hey.|I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!|No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.|I can’t do that.
There he is!|Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.|Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Oh, okay.  Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.|Who is it?
It is your office.|Do you know who at my office?
John?|Oh John! Great!
Here he is.|Ew.
Wow! I would trade.|It is beautiful, but I’m gonna use this one. Now, if you’ll excuse me.
Wow! I would trade.|No-no! This is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring. You don’t want to break her heart now do you?
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?|You’re dying?!
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?|Yeah, she’s dying… Of a cough apparently.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…|Okay, that’s enough honey!
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…|I don’t know.  Let me see the ring.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…|Great! Okay, here.
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…|
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…|Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!  Hey! I’m marrying a dead woman!

I mean, I’m the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?|That’s not what she said last night.

Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, can I have your jacket?|Oh, yeah.  Uh, no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?

Oh my God!|I know, but just let me say it.
Oh my God, Richard.|What?! I’m Chandler!  Oh, that’s Richard!

Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.|Richard! No one supposed to know about us!  See I, did it again.
Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?|Yeah, I’ll sit down.
It’s good to see you|You’re table’s ready sir.
It’s good to see you|Oh. Good to see you guys.
It’s good to see you|Yes.
It’s good to see you|Or if you prefer, this table is available.
It’s good to see you|That might be fun.
What were you thinking?!|I didn’t know it was an auction!
Wh?!|I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!|I don’t know! Charity?
Ugh!|Well, just buy the damn boat!
Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?|I’m just helping the kids!
How is you drinking helping the kids?|Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
How is you drinking helping the kids?|Mr. Tribbiani.
How is you drinking helping the kids?|Oh hi!
How is you drinking helping the kids?|Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
How is you drinking helping the kids?|Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
How is you drinking helping the kids?|I think it was valued at 19,000
How is you drinking helping the kids?|Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money.
Joey! Joey, good one!|That’s good. Very good!
Joey! Joey, good one!|So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now.
Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!|Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!
I know. Okay.  Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.|Okay.
Okay.|Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom.|And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.|Oh my God!
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.|I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.|It’s so great seeing you guys again. I’d like to make a toast.  Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed."
Ohh.|What?!
Oh my God, you guys!!|Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Who?|Richard!
What?  Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.|Oh you knew that. Good!
What?  Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.|I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.|Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!
Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.|Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first  weighing stuff.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.|If the school finds out you’re fired.
Hmm.|She’s leaving for three months.
Hmm.|For camp!
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…|Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!
No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her.|Okay well I think…that’s your answer.
I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.|Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.|Oh great!
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.|Oh, okay.
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.|Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.|It’s a trip for two!  Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.|That was me.
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.|Oh, en chante.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?|That’s me.
Ahh, yes.|Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.|
You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.|I was actually relieved uh I didn’t win the boat. My wife would’ve killed me.
You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.|Ohh…
Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!|Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?
Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!|It’s Pam.
Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!|Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
Aw-awww!|I don’t think she’d like that.
Aw-awww!|Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
Oooooh…|I don’t think so dear.
Oooooh…|Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. —arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin’! You can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy.
Oooooh…|What the hell, it’s for a good cause! All right!
No way! It’s mine!!|What?! What?!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!|But Joey you don’t have $20,000!
Oh my God, you’re back!|Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Oh my God, you’re back!|Why do you want to see my hand?
Oh my God, you’re back!|I wanna see what’s in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
Yeah.|Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.
Yeah.|
Yeah.|What did you guys just do?!
Yeah.|What happened?
Yeah.|Richard was there so I couldn’t do it!
What?! Noooo…|I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!
We didn’t ruin it!|Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
We didn’t ruin it!|Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…
Glove salesman!|Good one! Yeah.
Glove salesman!|This is terrible. What am I going to do?
Glove salesman!|Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
Glove salesman!|That’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
Glove salesman!|Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you’re scared of commitment! Convince her that you’re a little coward!
Glove salesman!|I can do that, I’ve had 30 years of practice.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!|I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
That guy’s still doing that?!|Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand!!
That guy’s still doing that?!|No, you’re too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?|Ross! Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…|You suck!!
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?|Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?|Hi guys!
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?|Hey!
Hey!|What are you up too?
Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.|Yeah, Big Brother.
Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.|Well that’s a little crazy. Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?|Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Eh…|Okay well that’s good to know.
Eh…|
Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?|Sure, I love this part!
Come on in.|Hi!
Come on in.|Richard!
Come on in.|Actually, I’m not here to complement the chef.
Come on in.|Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what’s up?
Come on in.|Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
Come on in.|Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Come on in.|No! I came here to tell you something else.  to tell you I still love you.
What uh—What did you—What?!|I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!|Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
Oh God…  Why don’t they put chairs back here?!|I know this is crazy but am I too late?
What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!|Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
What were you doing in Africa?|Working with blind kids.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.|Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!|You are?
Yeah!|Why?
Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.|I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.
Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?|Not that often!
No! I’m so happy for them!|Me too! So happy for them!
I’m so happy and not at all jealous.|Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.|Totally. I’m like 90/10.
Yeah me too.|Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?|Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!|If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?|Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!|Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!
Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!|It’s okay, I got a plan.
We’re gonna find love!|Definitely!
Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.|What do you mean?
Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.|You mean a backup?
Exactly!|Yeah, yeah I got that.
You do?|Hm-mmm.
Who?|Joey.
Joey?!|Yeah!
Are you serious?!|Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.|Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh, seriously?|Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were…
Charming.|Well hey, it’s just a backup.
Hey Monica!|Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?|Yeah, it’s great.
Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!|I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?|It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!
Well, you know Chandler.|No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.
Maybe you changed?|I didn’t change!
Maybe that’s the problem.|What?!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.|Is that some kind of boat talk?
I don’t know!  I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.|What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!|Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.
There are?|Yeah! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!|That’s right.
Chandler loves marriage!!|You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|What happened you guys?
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Rach!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Hey you!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Hey, come on in.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Oh thank you. Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Yeah, love. It’s a tricky business isn’t it?
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|I guess so.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What’s that?!"
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Exactly.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Ohh, yeah I already have one.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|What? Who?
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Phoebe.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Phoebe?! Wait a—but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Ohh, I don’t think so.
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|That’s impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
Where the hell have you been?!|I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!|What?!
Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!|My—Oh my God!
I know! They suck!!|He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!
I know!|Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?!
Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!|You’re right.
Yeah!|Okay.  I’m just going to propose!
Okay.|Okay great.
Dude-dude-dude!|What?!
Hi.|Hi.
I don’t know why I’m here.|I didn’t ask. You wanna come in?
I don’t know.|Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
Chandler is such an idiot!|Drink?
Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…|…on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Still smoking cigars?|Uh, no! No! That’s…art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
No that’s, that’s okay.|So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.|Oh really?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.|Who is it?
Edward Nevski?|Yeah he’s no good. Do you ever  non-eye doctor way?
No.|Ahh.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!|Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!
What?!|Hey!
What?!|Hey!
What?!|Phoebe! We’re both  your backup?!
What?!|Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
What?!|I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
What?!|No we weren’t!
What?!|I was not!
What?!|Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!
Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!|Pick me!!
Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!|No! Pick me! I don’t want to end up an old maid!
Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!|All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat—This is hard!
Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!|This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!|Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!|No wait! Just—Okay—Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don’t make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
Oh God, Phoebe!|I’m talking about massages.
Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin  and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?|Okay that’s fair.
Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin  and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?|All right.
Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin  and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?|Good!
Pick one.|Left!  Thank you.
You’re welcome.|Ross!
We should just switch.|Yeah absolutely!
We should just switch.|Yeah.
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!|Excuse me?
Oh!  Him.|Oh.  Whew!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!|Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that!|I think that’s fair.
Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!|It’s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey.  Shhhh.
Nothing.  I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…|I know.
Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know, some stuff before I can…|Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want.
Chandler.|Where is she? I’m not scared of you!
She’s not here and please come in.|Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Okay, she was here, but she left.|Well where did she go?
Well she said she had to think things over.|Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.|Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Well all right, one thing happened?|Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Well I’m sorry.|And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.|But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.|It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake!  I was gonna propose tonight.
You were gonna propose?|Yeah I even  Did you get a ring?
No I don’t have a ring!  And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don’t let her go. Trust me.|Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
Dude!|I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
She’s gone.|What?
She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.|What are you talking about?
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.|Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.|Well where… Where did she go?
To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.|I can’t believe I ruined this.
I am so sorry man.|You wanted it to be a surprise.
I am so sorry man.|Oh my God.
I am so sorry man.|Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
I am so sorry man.|Okay!  Monica, will you marry me?
I am so sorry man.|Yes.
I am so sorry man.|I knew you were likely to take a wife!
Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!|Come in! Come in!  We’re engaged!!!
Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!|Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!
Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!|Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn’t here!
Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!|Oh…
Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!|Oh hell, he’s done this three times! He knows what its about!
Hey, what’s going on?|Hey.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica’s quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."|Yeah I’ll take that.
What’s up?|Monica and I are engaged.
Oh my God.  Congratulations.|Thanks.
Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over.|Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I’m gay! I’m gay!" Can I bring her in?
Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over.|Oh no, let her stay out there. It’s sweet.
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh!  Our special night. I mean it just wouldn’t be my—our-our night, if you all weren’t here to celebrate with me—us—Damnit!|It’s okay, I want this to be your night too.  To Monica.
Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.|To Monica!
Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.|So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y’know, I’m kinda musical.
Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.|Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she’s even had time to…
Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.|Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.|Yeah, you’re on your own.
Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.|But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.  What?
Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.|So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.|You guys don’t think I look 19?
Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.|Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!|Okay.
Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!|Okay.
Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!|Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!|Oh honey no, you ate it all.
Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!|I was afraid of that.
|Know what I mean?
Yeah, but I don’t think we have time.|There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!|
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!|Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
Phoebe!|If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.
Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood.  Hey!|Hey!
You look great!|Oh, thanks.
You okay over there?|I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm… No, y’know what? Nevermind, I’m gonna be fine.
Hey!|Hi!
Wow! Happy Monica’s night!|Well thank you, you too.
Thanks.|Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Well sure. But I get married all the time so…|Ohh…
You okay?|Yeah, I guess. I-I… I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?
You mean, we—you and me?|Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.|Shake it off.
I mean—no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare.  No, but there was some good times.|No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…
Surely you can think of something good.|Yeah, just give me a minute!  Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
What?|Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?|Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
My hands?|Yeah.
Yeah?|Uh-huh.
Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.|Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did?  We uh, we never had bonus night!
A what?|Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?|Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?|Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me.
So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation, ‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!|Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!|Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Wow thanks!|Joe?
Yeah!|Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.|Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.
Don’t worry about that man, that happens.|It’s happened to you?
Yeah! Once.|Well, what’d you do?
Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go!  Why aren’t you dressed yet?!|I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.|Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Fair enough, now go get ready!|Okay.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…|Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…|What?
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…|See, I’ve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I’m only planning on doing this once. So, uh y’know, maybe this is selfish and I’m sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…|Oh honey, but it is just about…
It is! It is!|No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together!
It is! It is!|What?!
It is! It is!|See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!|Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Yeah!|That’s true.
Yeah!|Honey I swear it we just kissed.
It was just a kiss.|You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
It was just a kiss.|Thunder being stolen!!
It was just a kiss.|Okay come on Phoebe, it’s nothing! Monica, come on!
Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!|Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!|I don’t think that’s what they were talking about Joe!!
Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!|What a great night, Chandler can’t do it, these guys kissed…
Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!|What?
Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!|What?!
Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!|You guys kissed! Oh my—this is huge!
Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!|No!
Oh no!|No-no, it’s really not huge.
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Well yeah, that and Chandler’s problem.
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Yes that would be lovely.
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Yes, you can pass for 19.
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Really?
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Yes!
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Seriously?
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|I’m 30!
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Joey, you are not! You’re 31.
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Aww crap!
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we’ll get us some Mai Thai’s,  maybe no more for you though.
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Y’know what? I-I think that umm, I don’t feel like going to The Plaza.
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Why?!
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look…
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|No-no, I-I really don’t want to talk about it! I don’t!
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Psss, that is whack!
Okay, I think I’ll play it at the wedding.|Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don’t."
Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.|Wouldn’t she?
Would she?|Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
Guess who?|Hey.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…|What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Still thinking about it huh?|Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  Especially you!
Oh, who cares?|I care!
And so do I.|Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Okay. Sure.|Am I going to let you watch me undress?
I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so typical.|Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Paris?|We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Keep talking.|Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!
Bonjour, monsieur.|Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.
Bonjour, monsieur.|It’s Paris, who knows we’re here!
|Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit.
What?!|Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
What?!|Pheebs, we’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
What?!|Oh, I see.
They break your heart, don’t they?|Y’know, I don’t really their permission.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!|Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.
What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.|They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there.  Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?|Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!|Yes.
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!|Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn’t want to talk to anyone, especially me?
What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!|No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!|Well, let’s just say it’s not the first time you’ve stolen my thunder.
What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!|What?!
What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!|Hey, here’s a thought.
What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!|Monica, what are you talking about?
What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!|My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
Ahh, third base.|It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!
Ahh, third base.|Monica, y’know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
Ahh, third base.|We had a characturist!
Ahh, third base.|Oh!!
Ahh, third base.|
Ahh, third base.|Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
Ahh, third base.|And yet, here we are doing it again.
Ahh, third base.|Ugh, Monica I don’t want to steal your stupid thunder!
Ahh, third base.|Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
Ahh, third base.|Got me.
Ahh, third base.|All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain’t gonna happen!
Ahh, third base.|I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
Ahh, third base.|I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
Ahh, third base.|Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
Ahh, third base.|Uh, Rachel, I’ve been thinking. I don’t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I’m calling it off.
Why to save your dignity my man.|Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Why to save your dignity my man.|I don’t know! I don’t—maybe you’re feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you’d get married first! Maybe you can’t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
Why to save your dignity my man.|Oh wow. That—y’know what? That is so unfair. Y’know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let’s go have sex!
Why to save your dignity my man.|I can’t believe you’re gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…|We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.|Who is it?
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.|It’s Monica, open up!
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.|Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
Oww!|Yeah, you like that baby?  May we help you?
Oww!|I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I’m going to announce that I’m pregnant!
Oww!|How is that ever going to happen?!
Oww!|All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
Oww!|I know why!
Oww!|No you don’t know why!
Oww!|Okay! Why?!
Oww!|Because! Because I was sad.
Oww!|What do you mean?
Oww!|Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not. I’m not even close. And I don’t know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that’s dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
Oww!|I don’t care, she slept with me.
Oww!|Anyway sweetie, I am, I’m so sorry I ruined your night.
Oww!|
Congratulations man.|Thanks.
And uh, Rachel.|Yeah.
|Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Oh thank you.|Okay.
Hey!|Hi!
Who wants French toast?|Oh, I’ll have some!
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Oww!
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|What’s the matter honey?
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|I don’t know, my hand feels weird. I guess it’s because, I’m engaged!  How long before it starts getting annoying?
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|It starts?
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Yeah, so let’s get started on the wedding plans!
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Okay!
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Already?!
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music…
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks…
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|What in God’s name is that?!
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven’t seen that since the forth grade!
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|This baby has got everything. Take y’know, locations for instance.  First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|That is so smart!  Break it off. Break it off now.
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at…|Hey! Ross!
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?|I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.
Oh my God! Of course, of course.  Wh-what’s going on?|Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?|Nothing—Why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!|Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?|Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.|Okay.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.|Aw.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.|Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick…  And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.|Y’know, something a little snugglyer?
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.|Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.|Well, the duck…
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.|What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.|Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.|Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!|Okay.
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?|Centerpieces!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?|Definitely roses.  But Lilies are the clear choice.
Oh my God! It’s like one mind.|Uh-huh!
Oh my God! It’s like one mind.|Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I’m gonna get cranky!
Oh my God! It’s like one mind.|Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
Oh my God! It’s like one mind.|Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
Oh my God! It’s like one mind.|What?!
Oh my God! It’s like one mind.|All right, I’m gonna go!
Oh my God! It’s like one mind.|Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
Oh my God! It’s like one mind.|I don’t know! But he did not eat your face cream!
Uh, Phoebe…|Oh Ross, hi.
Phoebe, what are you doing?|I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.
Phoebe!|Okay, let’s talk outside.
Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!|What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!
And they knew about it?|Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!|Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!
Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?|Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?
No.|Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Joey, did you my face cream?|Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.
Joey,  where did you learn that word?|Where do you think,  Zelda?
You found my book?!|Yeah I did!
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!|Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn!
Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.|You got porn!
Hello.|Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night.|Ohh great.
Can I, can I help you with something?|Well, I don’t know. Are you a masseur?
Yes I am.|Great!
So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.|Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.|I remember when we first got engaged.
So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.|Oh, I don’t think I ever heard that story.
So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.|Oh dad, really you don’t need to…
So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.|Well, I’d gotten Judy pregnant. I still don’t know that happened.
You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!|What a sweet story.
You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!|Well, at least you’re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!|What?! They wanted a scary story!
You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!|Anyway, we’re really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we’ll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.  What?
You tell her Jack, I can’t do it.|What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?
You tell her Jack, I can’t do it.|We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!|We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!|Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t put a price on that sweetie.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!|We really do feel bad about this though.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!|We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
What about when I started dating Chandler?|Well it was Chandler! We didn’t think he’d ever propose!
What about when I started dating Chandler?|Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!|We might still have some money, if your father didn’t think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!|It seemed like such a simple idea.
I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!|Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!|All right, enough! I don’t want to hear about it anymore!
I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?|I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.
I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?|Well what happened at dinner?
My parents spent the money for our wedding!|My God! What did you order?!
My parents spent the money for our wedding!|Wait, but there’s no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
My parents spent the money for our wedding!|Honey, it’s gonna be okay.
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!|No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!|Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we’re gonna get married.
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!|Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!|Look, why don’t you just pay for it yourself?
How? I don’t have any money.|Well, I have some.
How much?|Well, close to…
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!|Well what?! How-how much is it?!
It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.|Ohh!  Really?!
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!|Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!|Well, you’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!|Ah, yeah!
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!|Well, come on, I’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!|Hello, Mr. Chandler.
This is the most special day of our lives.|No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Honey, umm I-I love you,  Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once.|Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?|Yes, I am!
You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?|Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
Hey Rach.|Joey.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?|Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire.|Well no, I don’t smell anything.
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Nothing!
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Y’know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|‘Sup?
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|I’m sorry?
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|I gave him an extremely professional massage!
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Okay, so it wasn’t uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Well, he’s never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Hey, y’know what? This is your fault! You’re the one that didn’t move his-his appointment.
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Oh, it’s my fault?! You didn’t have to massage him! You could’ve sent him away! You could’ve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|He said he liked that!! Oh you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?|His daughter was hot.
Hey.|Hey.
Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.|Ehh.
Eh, you work for that.|Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do?!|Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.
Oh, you’re so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?|Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
You thought about that?|Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?|Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
What else did you think about?|Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding.|Sure you do.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.|You sure?
Uh-hmm.|I love you so much.
I love you.  Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.|Oh yeah, totally!
Hello, Zelda.|Who are you supposed to be?
The vicar!|Do you even know what a vicar is?
Like a goalie, right?|Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m not—it’s just not funny anymore!
All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.|All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!
Huh?|That’s right, I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
|Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body!
This body?|Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven.|Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride!
Hey, you guys!|Hey!
So, what do you think?|About what?
So, what do you think?|Yeah, what?
So, what do you think?|What?
Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint.|Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!
I got glasses!|Well, you-you’ve always had glasses.
No I didn’t!|Are you sure?
No I didn’t!|Yeah-yeah, did-didn’t you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of umm…
No I didn’t!|Feminine.
No I didn’t!|Yes!
No!|Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Really?|Yeah!
You didn’t think I used to wear glasses, right?|Of course!
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?|That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?|If someone wants to give us a present, we don’t want to deprive them of that joy.
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?|Oh, y’know what you should get ‘em? One of those little uh, portable CD players.
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?|Oh, I already have one.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.|Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.|Hey, I know I what I want!
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.|What we want honey.
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.|No, you don’t want this. I want to have your grandmother’s cookie recipe.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?|Uh-huh, yeah.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?|Dying people say the craziest things.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?|I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.
Break my heart—Oh, all right.|Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies.
Break my heart—Oh, all right.|Our kids are gonna be fat aren’t they.
Break my heart—Oh, all right.|Ahoy!
Break my heart—Oh, all right.|Hey! How’s the boat?!
Break my heart—Oh, all right.|Great! I’m finally getting into this sailing stuff.
Break my heart—Oh, all right.|Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?
Break my heart—Oh, all right.|Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!
If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?|Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?|Well, it’s good that you finally have a place to do that.
If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?|Y’know Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.
If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?|You could?
If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?|Yeah! I’ve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.
Your own boat?|What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Do you know what I was thinkin’?|What?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.|Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?|No, why?
Then free as a bird. What’s up?|My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Then free as a bird. What’s up?|Wow! That’s great! Dad must really like you, he doesn’t ask just anyone to play.
Then free as a bird. What’s up?|Yeah and he didn’t really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.
Well, did-did you correct him?|No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Well, did-did you correct him?|This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.
Well, did-did you correct him?|Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.
Well, did-did you correct him?|Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.
Well, did-did you correct him?|Yeah.
Well, did-did you correct him?|He hates to lose.
Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.|You’re not a lefty?
Does anybody know me?!|What’s wrong Phoebe?
Does anybody know me?!|I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!
Does anybody know me?!|No!! Why didn’t you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!
Does anybody know me?!|Because I’m normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.
Does anybody know me?!|Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?
Don’t worry about it Pheebs.|No one got me an engagement present.
Don’t worry about it Pheebs.|Okay, here I wish you health and happiness.
An old cookie?|This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts!
An old cookie?|See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.
We can’t accept this.|Why not?
‘Cause it’s gross.|No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
‘Cause it’s gross.|Really?!
‘Cause it’s gross.|Yeah! I bet I can do it.
Okay, we owe you a present.|Two! I’ve been engaged twice!
Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?|That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.|Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.
All right.|Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there  Yo-ho-ho!|Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though,  what’s this called?
Uh, boat rope.|Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Uhh, rub it?|No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…|Time’s up, now your dead.
And deaf!|Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Yes.|Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.|You do?
You don’t?  Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.|That and arrogance.
You don’t?  Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.|Hey.
Hey! How was sailing?|I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie.
Hey! How was sailing?|No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!
Hey! How was sailing?|
Hey! How was sailing?|I can’t believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmother’s legacy is this crumb.  I wish you a long and happy marriage.
Hey! How was sailing?|Hey.
Hey! How was it?|Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…
Hey! How was it?|I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
Hey! How was it?|And what did he ask you not to call him?
Hey! How was it?|Daddy. All right look, here’s the story.  So I take off my glasses and that’s when in happened.
Guys?|Over here.
Guys?|Have a seat son.
Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!|I know.
You gave my father a lap dance!|Why do they put so much steam in there?!
You gave my father a lap dance!|‘Cause otherwise they’d have to call it the room room.
You gave my father a lap dance!|Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
You gave my father a lap dance!|Come on, it’s not that big a deal!
You gave my father a lap dance!|Not that big a deal? There…there was touching of things.
You gave my father a lap dance!|Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?
Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!|I don’t want him to tell this story for years.
Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!|Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
I wasn’t escaping.|Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.|You were trying to eat it!
I was trying to help out a squirrel.|If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
All right, I’m off to see your dad.|Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?
All right, I’m off to see your dad.|Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass.|Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass.|I don’t know. Y’know, they didn’t get us anything.

Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.|Let’s give it a shot.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.|Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
No, just a Friday night.|Ohh, these are pretty good.
No, just a Friday night.|Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
No, just a Friday night.|Which one was that?
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.|Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I’m okay.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.|Are there anymore from the good batch? ‘Cause we could just work off of those.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.|Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uh…
Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side.  Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?|Ohh yeah.
Right?|Nope.
It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.|I don’t know why you just don’t say left.
Okay, go to the left.  The left!|Huh?
|Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.|Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?|Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!|Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!|All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!
What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!|Why not?!
Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!|Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I?  Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!|Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!
No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.|Well, hey I did learn.
Really?|Yeah! Come on.
Awww…|Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is.  I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Left.|Damnit!
Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.|Looking up?
Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.|Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.
Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.|Aww, Pheeb, come on isn’t there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032.|That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.
That’s what you think.|Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?
Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.|What was her name?
Nesele Toulouse.|Nestle Tollhouse?!
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.|
Ohh.|I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.|I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
What did you do when they found out?|They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.|Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope?
Ohh we’re not sailing.|Just pull on it.
All right.  Sandwiches!|What else?
Here you go.|Thank you.
Oh wow!|What are you doing?
Ohh, sorry.|What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all the good stuff fall out.
Ohh whoops.|Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami!  Oh my God! I’m my dad!
Ohh whoops.|David Schwimmer
|You can say that again Mac.
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|Oh yeah? Well then how come I can’t get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|So, what did you guys think?
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|It’s your mommy. It’s your mommy.
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|Ohhhh…

Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|It wasn’t the best.
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|Wh-what are we gonna tell him?
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|Well, the lighting was okay.
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|Ohh no you don’t! You got lighting last time, lighting is mine!
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|And I have costumes.
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|Oh great! That means I’m stuck with, "So, we were watching you in there  and you were sittin’ right here! Whoa!"
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|What are you gonna do Pheebs?
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|I don’t know. I don’t know. I can’t lie to him again. Oh no I—no! I’m just gonna press my breasts up against him.
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|And say nothing?
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|Uh-huh, yeah that’s right.
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|It wasn’t that good.

Oooh!|I get to hire my own assistant!
Oooh!|Ahhh!!
Oooh!|Well—I got a head rush from standing up to fast right there.
And you were at this job for four years?|That’s right.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?|What?
I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.|No dear. It’s not.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.|Thank you! Good meeting you.

Uh-huh, go on.|That’s it. That’s my whole name.
That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here.|I know I haven’t worked in an office before, and I really don’t have a lot of experience, but uh…
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on!|It’s lame, I know. But I’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn…
No-no-no-no.|Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
No-no-no-no.|Hey sweetie.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?|I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.|Awww.  But still no.
No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.|Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Oh no-no, I can’t do that.|If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.
Okay.|Okay.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.|Oh my God. He threw up?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe’s secret?|Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.
That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?|That’s right! You lose sucker!!  Please still marry me.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?|Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…|What about him?
I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.|Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing?  Look how pretty!|Let’s see.
Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!|Let me see this guy.  W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey-hey-hey Joey!|Hey Terry!
Good to see you again!|It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
It’s a different building.|So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Why don’t we start right now!|Okay.
Here are the audition scenes.|Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Why would you think that?|Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Everybody has to audition.|Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series,  with a robot.
I’m sorry Joey that’s…that’s the way it is.|Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y’know what?  This is one star who’s hoop… This is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?|I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren’t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first…  There is a plant in your office.
Kinda.|Right. So I guess I shouldn’t put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Oh-ohh, thank you.|Anyway, I’m guessing you hired somebody.
Well…|Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
But I hired you!|What?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!|I am?!
Yeah!|I can’t believe it!
Hey.|Hey! Good, you’re home!
Oh it’s always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"|Hey baby.
Hey.|I made you a surprise.
Oh yeah?|Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them.
Did you not understand the story?|Hey!
Hey! What’s up?|Ross!
Hey! What’s up?|Oh, nothin’ much. Just trying to figure out what I’m gonna do for dinner.
Huh.|Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
No!  Shhh!|What you got over there? Tacos?
No!  Shhh!|No! No. They’re umm… They’re just uh…ground beef smileys.
No!  Shhh!|Uhh, those are tacos.
No!  Shhh!|Excuse me Mr. Mexico.
No!  Shhh!|Eh, either way I’ll pass.  What’s so funny?!
No!  Shhh!|I’m not laughing.
No!  Shhh!|You told her!
Nancy Thompson’s getting fired!|Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
Nancy Thompson’s getting fired!|You’re right. I mean I’m sorry. Yeah, I shouldn’t be laughing. I should be laying down papers for you!
Nancy Thompson’s getting fired!|How could you tell her?!
I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!|Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Du-ude!|What happened in Atlantic City?!
Du-ude!|Well, Chandler and I are in a bar…
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"|And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"|You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.|Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?|Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Hi!|Hey.
Hi!|Hey—Ooh, how’s Hilda? Is she working out?
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.|Was she happy you gave her the job?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.|They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.|Sorry.
I’m sorry Joey.|Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!|All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Ross came in forth and cried!|Oh my God!
Ross came in forth and cried!|Oh, is that funny?! Oh, you-you find that funny?! Well maybe Chandler should know some of your secrets too!
Ross came in forth and cried!|I-I already told him everything!  You shush!!
Ross came in forth and cried!|Once Monica was sent to her room without dinner, so she ate the macaroni off a jewelry box she’d made.
Ross came in forth and cried!|Ross used to stay up every Saturday night to watch Golden Girls!
Ross came in forth and cried!|Monica couldn’t tell time ‘til she was 13!
Ross came in forth and cried!|It’s hard for some people!
Wow—whoa!|Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Hey!!!|Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross!
Hey!!!|Ohh! Ohh! In college, Chandler got drunk and slept with the lady who cleaned our dorm!
That was you!|Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’!|Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.|What happened?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.|Joey, why would you do that?
Because they wanted me to audition!|You! An actor?! That’s madness!
Rachel Green’s office.|Tag?  Hi, who was that?
Nobody. I was just practicing.|Really?
Nobody. I was just practicing.|Hi!
Hi! Rachel Green’s office.|You must be Hilda.
Hi! Rachel Green’s office.|Yeah, this is Tag. Tag, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|So you hired yourself a little treat did ya?
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|All right I know, I know how it looks Pheebs, but I’m telling you…
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|But-but you know you cannot get involved with your assistant.
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|Yes, I know that. I know that. And I know that hiring him was probably not the smartest thing that I’ve ever done. But I’m telling you, from this moment on I swear this is strictly professional.  Yes?
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|Hey Rachel!
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|Hi!
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|Cute assistant! What’s his story? Is he…

Wait! Terry! Wait—Look—Wait I-I… Look, I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.|I can’t help you Joey.
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.|It’s not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray’s a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.

Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.|And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.|You have no trouble telling time now right?
No!|Quick! What time is it?!
I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?!|Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah?|Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.
Ohh, absolutely.|And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Yeah, definitely!|Okay,  if you’ll excuse me, I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story.
Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe.|Man!
Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe.|Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldn’t hang out with…all the guys in my office.
|Do you have a minute?
Well yeah, sure, what’s up?|I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch…by guys.
Oh really?!|Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?|But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay.
Why’s that?|I don’t think I should say.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things.|Okay.
‘Kay.|Well…
Yeah.|I’d love to ask out your friend Phoebe.

Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!|Oh Willie’s still alive!
What are you guys doing?|Oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we’re looking for a good picture of us.
Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.|That’s not true, there are great pictures of us!
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this…|Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty.
I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.|Oh, here’s a great one.
Yeah, I’m not in that.|I know, but look at me all tan.
Yeah, I’m not in that.|Hey, why don’t you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
Yeah, I’m not in that.|That’s a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y’know…
Yeah, I’m not in that.|Yeah that’s great! Next to that, Chandler won’t look so stupid.
Yeah, I’m not in that.|Chandler what do you say?
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh…|How about those three pointers?
Amazing!|And those guys were this  close to lettin’ us play this time too.
Amazing!|Hey look-look, Phoebe’s talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.|Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.|Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.|Hey, I thought that guy was married.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.|He is! But he’s getting divorced—Ross! Maybe you know him.
It’s not a club.|Phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!|They have that on the napkins at the club.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!|Oh, I gotta get back to work.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!|You don’t have to be back for a half-hour!
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!|Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!|Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y’know you can’t date him right?
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!|Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.|I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it.
Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.|So you wouldn’t mind if he was dating someone else?
Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.|Why? Is he? He is! Isn’t he? He’s dating that slut in marketing!
Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.|Dude that is so sad.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.|Could I play?
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?|I just did them.
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!|What?
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?|Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?|Hey Rachel!
|Umm, is Tag here?
No. Why?|Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?|Well, we’ve been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room, okay? But, y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.|Oh no!
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.|Hey! Isn’t that Tag’s backpack.
Great! That’s great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?|Okay.
I’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?|No, I am.
I’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?|Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
I’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?|I do?
I’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?|Yeah!  All right, maybe you don’t have to smile. Let’s try something else. Let’s try umm, try looking sexy.
I’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?|Okay.
I’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?|Or not.
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?|Uhh, well I’ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt.  You got an extra one?
Yeah, sure. Umm…here.|Great.  You got anything that’s not Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, I don’t think so Joe.|All right, I guess this will be fine.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?|Nothing, why?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay.|Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!|Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money.
Joey, just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it.|Yeah, okay.
Yeah?|Sure, no problem.  Ooh—Hey, donuts!
Yeah!|Okay.
I know. Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment. Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come.  Hey! Don’t laugh at him! He’s my drowning moron!|Aww!

Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!|Okay.  I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?

Like she’s really mean, and she’s over critical, and-and—No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!|Okay.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!|Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
You’re still gonna go out with her?!|Yeah!
Well, didn’t you just hear what I said?!|Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
No listen to me! She is crazy!|Uh, your door isn’t sound proof.
Good morning.|Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.|Ohh that’s nice.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!|Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Well kinda old, like 30.|Oh.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.|That’s great! Wow man, so Joey must’ve really taught you some stuff huh?
A little.|Yeah?
See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera.  You’re changing it!|I can’t help it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?|Borrow money from me?
Okay, first—first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , you’re looking down, keep looking down…|Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a donut.|Hi!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
Yeah! That guy’s all right!|Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
What?|Y’know, all the women.
Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler.|I’m right here!
Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler.|All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it’s just—And I know he’s my assistant and I can’t date him—but it just bothers me, all right?!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!|I’m still right here!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!|All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
What?!|I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush—And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just physical! But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
I know, Monica told me.|Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
I know, Monica told me.|Yeah. Sure.
I know, Monica told me.|Can you people not see me?!
I know, Monica told me.|So, will you talk to him?
I don’t know Rach.|Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?|I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me?
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.|Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women.
Really?|Yeah, for you!
Hey! There you are!|There I am!
Are you okay?|Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
What?!|Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Chandler, what were you thinking?|I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now.
Chandler?|
Hi.|Hi.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?|Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass."
Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.|Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
You think he’s emotionally unavailable?|I think he can be.
Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night!|Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997.|I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
We want the last six years back!!|So do we!! So do we!!  I’m sorry you had to see that.
Good morning Rachel.|Hi!  Thanks, hey so uh what’d you do last night?
Went out with Joey.|Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
No. We had a really good talk. I don’t think I’m gonna do that bar scene anymore.|Wow! I did not see that coming.
It’s just not really who I am. Y'know, I’ve always been happier when…Why am I telling you this? You don’t care about this stuff.|Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y’know?
When I’m in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.|Really?
Someone I can spoil, y’know?|Sp-spoil?
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?|Uh-huh.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?|Well, I-I’m startin’ too.
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?|Yes! Hell yes!
All right then, it’s settled.|Okay.
I’m gettin’ back together with my ex-girlfriend.|I’d love to!
What?|Yeah!
My God!|Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney?
Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!|Oh he knows!  For the most part.
Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!|Oh hey! Good, you’re both here.
Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!|We kinda need to talk.
Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!|Both of you together?
Wh-what’s up?|Well, I went over to Kyle’s last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing…
Wh-what’s up?|…we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So…
Oh just say it Kyle!|We’re gonna give it another try.
Oh just say it Kyle!|What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
Oh just say it Kyle!|I’m gonna work on that.
Oh just say it Kyle!|Oh right, because you’re so capable of change.
Y’know, he hums when he pees!|I do know.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.|We’re so sorry.
That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already.|Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.
That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already.|Yeah, we’re gonna go.
I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.|Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Yeah, were better off without them.|And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!
Divorced men’s club.|Potato, Potaato.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!|Ooh, let’s see it!
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!|Ahhh.
Okay.|Oh yeah, that looks good.
Okay.|You guys make a very attractive couple.
Okay.|Yeah, we look great together.
Yeah, we really do!|Okay.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!|Y’know, we don’t have to imagine.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!|I’m marrying her.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!|We’ll just see.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.|Oh my God! This is it!  I really hope it’s you!
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.|I hope it’s you.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.|Me too!
First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me…|Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…|Yes!!! Oh!!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…|Hypothetically!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…|Still.
If Phoebe were my maid of honor…|Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.|Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.|Yeah, I’ll do that. So who gets to be yours?
Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!|Wh-why is that the best part?
Because then I don’t have to!|Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…
I’m really not deciding!|Fine!
I’m really not deciding!|Excuse me, I-I couldn’t help overhearing, you’re marrying Chandler Bing?

Hey Rachel?|Yeah?
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?|Really?!
Uh-hmm.|Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.
Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…|Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!
But why does it even matter?!|Why does it matter so much to you?!
Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!|What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?
You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!|Yeah but Phoebe…
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish.  Oh I guess that was it.|Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor.
Oh, thank you so much!  Okay.|I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.
Oh I know.|Better than Chandler.
What happened?!!|Well, I don’t know!!
We fell asleep! That is all.|Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go.
I think that would be best.|Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.
Okay. But not about this!|No! Never! Never!  Bye.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.|That’s sweet.
No, it’s more like a  good luck.|So uh, what did this woman look like?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.|Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?|No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive…  Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
What are you doing?|Well, let’s see…
Oh my God yes! Who is she?|Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Did you break up with her?|No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Why?|Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…
Fat?!|I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow…"
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!|Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Well, apparently she does.|Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.  Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Hey! What’s going on?|Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?|You have been maid of honor before?!!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?|See? This is exactly why you shouldn’t lie!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?|All right that’s it! I am maid of honor!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?|Na-uh, I am!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?|How come you are?!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?|Because I cared enough to lie!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.|What are you talking about?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.|Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.|Well, it’s better than us deciding.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.|Oh, come on! This is crazy! Can’t we just flip a coin?!
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.|No! Coins hate me!
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.|Okay. Okay fine, y’know what? We will let Ross and Joey decide.  Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.|Hey there, you handsome thing.
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.|Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.
Hi.|Just uh, brought back your videos.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.|No! No we don’t!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!|I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!|I’ve had better.
Okay! When?!|All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Uh-huh!|I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
I want to do it again.|We can’t do it again.
Why not?|Because it’s weird!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?|Sure, what do you got?
Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are!|Can you figure out what I’m doing?
You’re Lewis Posin.|Who?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?|Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa….  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.|What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.|Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.|No, 10 is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?|Because it’s the highest.
I don’t want to marry Chandler!|Okay, uh…
I’ve got cold feet.|…it’s gonna be okay!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!|Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!|Thanks!
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!|Yes, very nice Rachel.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!|Thank you judges.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!|Ugh, what a kiss ass.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!|Oh!
Okay, Phoebe…|Yes! Your honor?
We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!|—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!|Oh!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!|Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!|Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!

Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!|Ohh, wait a minute, we haven’t pre…
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!|Go!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!|Okay! Okay! Umm, Webster’s Dictionary defines marriage as…  Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uh… I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!|Oh! That’s nice.
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!|Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I’ve known them separately and I’ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.
Wow.  Good speech.|Yeah, it really was!
Wow.  Good speech.|Aw, thanks!
Wow.  Good speech.|Okay Phoebe, I guess you’re next  although I really don’t see the point.
Yeah.|Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.|Hello Skidmark.
It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.|It’s pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.|That’s why you broke up with me?
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!|Really?! I won!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!|What?!

All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!|Well then I demand a recount!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!|Actually, it wasn’t that close.
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!|No! Y’know what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculous—We’re gonna flip a coin!
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!|The coins have finally forgiven me!

All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!|You guys are the best!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.|Yeah?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.|Why-why would I care about that?
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.|Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.
I would really love it if could do both.|All right, I…I have to ask.
What?|Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
What?!|Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
A hundred and forty-five pounds.|In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!|Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.|How?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!|What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!
Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.|Keep going.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.|Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
I’d carry you around in my pocket.|I love you.
Hi Pheebs.|Hi!
Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.|That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once.  Oh, you mean today.
Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.|Oh yeah!
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…|Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride.  Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.|Ohh.
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings.  I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.|This stuff is great!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue.  Yeah…|Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor.
You do? Why?|Because I think it means more to you.
But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.|Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14?
No, I was ten. I just developed early.|Man alive!
No, I was ten. I just developed early.|Hey, what’s going on?
Hey!|Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Hey!|
Great nap.|It really was.

|David Schwimmer
Morning!|Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Pretty good.|Oh good.
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work.|What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!
Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.|Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.|Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?
Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.|Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Fine!|Hi!
Fine!|Hi.
Fine!|Sorry about that, but I couldn’t get that lock to work on the door.
Fine!|Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
Fine!|You must be Rachel, I’m Erin.
Fine!|Hi.
Fine!|Hi. I don’t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
Fine!|Would you like some pancakes?
…Come on! Why are we here?!|Okay, okay take a guess.
The hot chicks?|Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Wow that’s actually pretty cool.|What is that?
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.|I’m so sorry!
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.|Sorry!
She sent the chicken back again?!|She says it’s to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!|OH…MY…GAWD!!!!
Janice.|How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
I’m fine.|Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I’m blind!
Oh… Uh…|So, who’s the lucky guy?
OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?|Well, she saw the ring.
Did she freak out?|Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Right.|Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
You said no right?|Huh?
You said no right?!|Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!|Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.
What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!|Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.|Really?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?|So-so you would’ve just lied?
Yes!!|Would it really have been that easy?
Yes!!!|Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with her and Clark.
Hey! What’s up?|Hey!
Hey-hey, who’s your friend?  Hey!!|Hey Joey!

So, system kinda broke down huh?!|We want you to marry her!
What?!!|She is so amazing! You have no idea.
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?|Cupid.
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?|Joey, she’s so cool. She speaks four languages.
Man, do you know what guys want!|Look Joey, come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere.|Yeah, but you always say that.
My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere.|Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
Look I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so.|Whatever.
Look I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so.|Fine.
Hey, don’t start judging me!  Huh? And you, you’re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!|Phoebe!
Hey, don’t start judging me!  Huh? And you, you’re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!|Secret affair!
People are doing it in front of my book!|I’m sorry?
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!|Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.|Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!|Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Well now what’s the rush?
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|I like to see the previews.  The candy.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Oh. Hey!
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Well look who’s here!
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Hey!
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Hey!
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Joey.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Erin.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Hey Rachel.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|What’s wrong?
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Oh no.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|What party?
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|A birthday party.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Who’s birthday party?
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Allison’s birthday party.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Oh, and how is Allison?
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|32.
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Wait a minute! Why don’t you guys do something?!
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|Yeah, look how that worked out.
Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?|Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!|How can I help you?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.|We are aware of the problem you are referring too.  But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can’t help you.
Hey.|Hey!
Hey.|How did it go with Erin?
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!|Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.|Didn’t you sleep together?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that’s a…|Oh, please don’t get married before I do.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!|He might still show up.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.|Is that all?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?|Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?|It’s actually going to be just family.
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!|What about Benitez?
What about Game 1 of the Series?|What about shut up?
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Okay.
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|So how’s it goin’ with Joey?
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Uh, okay.
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Look, he’s a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don’t see this having a future.
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Kinda.
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Then change it back!
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|I’m sorry I… It’s just there’s no real spark.
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|No spark? Didn’t you sleep together?
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Yeah.
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Ugh, tramp!
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Does Joey have any idea?
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|I really don’t think he does. And y’know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y’know, tell him I’m-I’m not interested in a serious relationship or something.
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Yeah, you mean like that you’re kind of a loner.
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Yeah! That would be great!
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Yeah, and maybe that you’re a real
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|I’m sorry?
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Oh well, I guess Italian isn’t one of the four languages you speak.
Hey! You wanna go?|Yeah, let’s go.
Okay. See you guys later.|Bye guys.
Okay. See you guys later.|Yeah, see ya.
|Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
|No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?|Yeah, we were…we were just looking around.
Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?|Uhh….
Ah… Ah…Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?|Uh, actually I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.|I’m sorry, who are you?
I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller.|Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It’s uh—Wait!  Did you write this?
Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!|Y’know, you look nothing like I would’ve thought. You’re…you’re so young.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hi!
Hey!|So how was, how was your date?
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.|Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.|Oh no, yeah.
No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.|Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she’s not lookin’ for a serious relationship.
Where are you gettin’ this?|Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner.
Oh. Oh.|Joey…
No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too!  Right?|Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her.
No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too!  Right?|Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell ‘em you’re not looking for a relationship.
No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.|Well that too.  Joey?
Yeah?|Do you want some pancakes?
What are we gonna do?|I say we go with Careless Whisper.
What are we gonna do?|Chandler?
What are we gonna do?|Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?|Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight.  I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?|Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what I might do.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?|Aren’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?|Do you have any tissues?
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.|Okay!
We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.|No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Kinda like your Barca lounger.|Is that what you’re thinking about right now?
I never stop thinking about it.|Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
I never stop thinking about it.|Janice, I’m sorry but umm, you can’t stay here tonight.
I never stop thinking about it.|Why not?
I never stop thinking about it.|Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
I never stop thinking about it.|Okay, I’m going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal.
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!|Why?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!|He does?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!|Say again?
That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.|Feelings, such strong feelings.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.|Oh…my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.
—Okay, see you later.|I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!|No, no, no. No-no-no.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!|Shhhh!
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?|No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
What? That's like insanely easy!|Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
What? That's like insanely easy!|It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.
What? You forgot fourteen states?|Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Oh, okay, time's up!|All right, I got 48.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?|Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?|Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?|Wow, how many have you got?
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?|Fifty-six!
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!|Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.
How come we have one extra place setting?|'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.|Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but I still do.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Regular Celery!
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Done! With time a-to-spare.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Oooh that may be a New World's record
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|What? That's impossible.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|I am only one man!  Okay Ross, time is up!
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|No, just give me another minute.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Okay, but if you can't…no dinner!
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|You're on!
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Pshhshhh!
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Chandler? Can you give me a hand?
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.|Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Oh, it's not!|Seriously, it's moving!
Oh, it's not!|What the hell is in there?
Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?|I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
That's my pie!|Which smells delicious!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!|What?
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?|Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
I'm sorry, who's this?|Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
I'm sorry, who's this?|Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!
No, there's no dog here?|Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica’s apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Oh my god! Where are you?|I'll be right there!
They're here already? How are they doing this?|Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
They're here already? How are they doing this?|I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.
They're here already? How are they doing this?|Well, sure! Come in!  Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?
They're here already? How are they doing this?|We kinda broke up this morning.
They're here already? How are they doing this?|Oh, I'm sorry.
They're here already? How are they doing this?|Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.
They're here already? How are they doing this?|Ohio!! Thank you!
Huh! Where is the dog?!|What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Huh! Where is the dog?!|Yeah that dog left!
Huh! Where is the dog?!|Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!
Huh! Where is the dog?!|There's no dog in here.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!|No that's just me coughing!  Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
What is it doing here?|Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait.  Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
What is it doing here?|Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!|That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Really?|Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Well, it still has to go, right?|Why?
Okay, it's um…|Don't do it!
Okay, it's um…|Don't do what?
Okay, I hate dogs.|What?
Okay, I hate dogs.|Are you crazy?
Okay, I hate dogs.|Are you out of your mind?
Okay, I hate dogs.|Why?
Okay, I hate dogs.|Told ya.
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.|Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.|Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?
Is there a puppy here?|You don't like puppies?
Okay, you are new!|Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.
Okay, you are new!|You don't like ice cream?
Okay, you are new!|It's too cold.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.|It hurts my teeth.
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.|1250.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Yeah.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Oh, I'd say about a month.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Really? I'd say 3 to 4.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Half hour.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Interesting.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|When it's your assistant, I would say never.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Huh. A moo-point?
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he’s obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.
Hey!|Hey.
How are you holding up?|Not bad.
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.|Thanks.
So were you guys together a long time?|A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Now that she broke up with you?|Yeah.
Yeah. Hmmmm.|It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.|Why?
Because, uh—it has to.|You have all the answers, don't you?
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.|Hey, thanks for talking to me.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!|All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!|What?
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!|
What did Joey say? I like you back?|Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.|No?  All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Wow.|Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
|What?
Right there! That's my car!  Hey!!|Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
I can't believe this!|
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.|Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.|Yeah, okay.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh, I can't leave her!|You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
That's not gonna work.|I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Hey! I didn't know either.|Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Where's Chandler?|Here I am.
Wash your hands!!!|How did you…know?
Hey! What's she doing back here?|Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...|No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...|See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...|Where's Monica?
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.|Why not?
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.|Well, I, I should go in there.
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.|Why not?
Because you sent away the dog!|This is ridiculous.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.|What's the matter?

And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.|Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.|Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.|And that doesn't scare you?

And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.|Ross, you need some help?
From you?  Yes, please!|First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.|Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth?  Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Hey, is Chandler here?|No, no he went for a walk.
Hi!|Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Hi!|Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!
Hi!|You think?
Hi, honey.|Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
What? Why, why would...|Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
What? Why, why would...|Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y’know, for you, and…
What? Why, why would...|We have good news, look whose back!
What? Why, why would...|Hi!
What? Why, why would...|Clunkers?! Oh my god!
That's right, she came back all by herself.|It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
That's right, she came back all by herself.|It is so good to see you!
That's right, she came back all by herself.|Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in… I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.|It's up to you.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?|I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Oh.|Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Oh.|Tag? Y-You're going?  Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?
Oh.|Colorado.
Oh.|Ah, what good are you.
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.|Okay.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?|Um, I'm not.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.|No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Really?|Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Delaware!  Delaware!|All right.
I want my turkey now!|You got it.  You got Nevada twice.
I know.|Yeah.
I know.|David Schwimmer
I’m ready!|You sure?
Uh-huh!|Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Thanks daddy.|No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours.
Thanks daddy.|Okay. Okay.
Thanks daddy.|Yes! Yes! Yes!!
Thanks daddy.|His first big kid’s bike, this is so exciting!
Thanks daddy.|Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and…it bent.
Thanks daddy.|Yeah.
Thanks daddy.|I never had a bike of my own.
Thanks daddy.|What?!
Thanks daddy.|Well, we didn’t have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
Thanks daddy.|That sounds like my first bike.  My dad gave me his old one.
Thanks daddy.|Ohh.
Thanks daddy.|Did the girl ever let you ride it?
Thanks daddy.|No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front.  So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
Thanks daddy.|That is so unfair!
Thanks daddy.|Not really, I got to drag him around too!
Hey! What are you guys doing?|Hey.
Hey! What are you guys doing?|Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
I’m sorry, who?|I’m gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
But we don’t know the neighbors.|I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
But we don’t know the neighbors.|See? This is exactly why I’m making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?|Gooood morning!!
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Where you can make out with your assistant.
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Come on, it’s not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Oh yeah, what’s the plan?
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|We… We are not… …going to let it… be a problem.
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Well y’know, we did other stuff too.
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Did you two…
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Oh Monica come on, y’know I don’t sleep with guys on the first date!
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire…
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Anymore!!
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Okay.
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?|Yes, at 4:00.
Okay, thank you. That’ll be all.|I’d better get back to my desk.
Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.|My what?
Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.|Are you serious?
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!|Well, either that or uh…
Joey!!|Yeah?
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!|Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!|Yeah, and they’ve been coming by all day. They love it!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!!|Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!|Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!!  Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!|Sure!
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!|Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so…

Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.|Well okay, I’ll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.|Mm! Seems like I would’ve remembered you!
Um-hmm.|Mm! Night Gar’!
So did you read your evaluation yet?|No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!|A joke they would appreciate?
I’m thinkin’ no.|What did you say?!
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.|No, not my touchie.

Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.|Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?

See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!|Maybe it’s not as bad as I think. Y’know, maybe they didn’t take it the way I meant it.

No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?|I told ‘em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.|Please, can’t you help me out?
Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.|Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.|Maybe, isn’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!|Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!|Yeah, that’s her.
All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!|Thank you.
It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work!|Y’know what would work?
Hmm?|Stop making candy!
But they like it!|You mean they like you.
Maybe.|Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…|Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!
Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!|Why? Why do I have to learn?
Well…In-in case of emergency.|What kind of an emergency?
Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you."|Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?|You won’t let go?
No!|Swear?!
I swear!|Okay.
Come on.|All right.

Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!|Weee!!!
Yes!! Yes!!!|Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…|I am shocked! Shocked!!
Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.|Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve only got two hands!!
Need some help?|No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!
Oh, hello liar.|Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.
I could’ve been killed I hope you know!|I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.|Phoebe.
What?!  What the hell?!|All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.
What?! Why?!|Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar  The bike is dying.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.|Great! Great!  You’re making the bike very happy.
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.|That’s kinda sad.
Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.|Got it!
Let’s roll!|Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
|Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?|Umm, no. Thanks, but I’ll give these to Betty.  So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
what would happen exactly.|Well, I’d be forced to file a report. I’d have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Well…|Uh Mr. Zelner, I’m the one who filled in that evaluation.
Oh no-no-no…|Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
Oh no-no-no…|You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
Oh no-no-no…|Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I’m kinda strangely proud of my butt.
Oh no-no-no…|It’s kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can’t figure out what this is?
You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what?  It doesn’t matter.|Yeah, it’s not like I don’t have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there’s a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now?
Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.|No, don’t worry about it.
No, you could’ve lost your job.|Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I’d find work.
Thank you! You’re great!|Y’know what?
What?|I feel great.  What?
I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.|Oh, I’m sorry.
What is going on?|We’re waiting for the candy.  Bring out the candy!
What is going on?|Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
Joey!|What’s up buddy?
What are you doing?|Waiting for candy.
Get in here!  Merry Christmas.|Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
Get in here!  Merry Christmas.|We want candy! We want candy now!
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down!  What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?|Candy Lady?
No not  Candy Lady.|Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!|That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!|Thank you.
You’re welcome.|Did you smoke?
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?|I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?|
I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.|Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Buh-bye.  I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.|Betrothed…
…betrothed couple.|Hey!
Hey!|Hi!
Hey!|Haaaa...  ... ahhhh!
Pheebs?|Huh?
Skull?|Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
Skull?|Oh my god!!
Skull?|No, no, no. It's not! It's not my mom. It belonged to mom. Yeah, no, she used to put it out every Christmas to remind us, that even though it's Christmas, people still die. And, you can put candy in it.
Skull?|Hey!
Skull?|Hey!
Skull?|Licorice?
Skull?|Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.
Skull?|Ohh! That's great!
Skull?|Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
Skull?|Nope. I mean, I know Susan does every year, but I think I wanna take this year to teach him all about Hanukkah.
Skull?|And maybe I could teach Ben about the Christmas skull and how people die.
Skull?|You may need to use this year to teach Ben about Phoebe.
Skull?|Hmm.
Skull?|Hey.
Skull?|Did you know he was in there?
Skull?|No.
How long have we been home?|About a half an hour.
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?|No.
Why not?|Bing's weird.
Why not?|Oh, hey, you guys!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey. Guess what! My landlord just called and my apartment is gonna get ready soon, so I guess I'll be moving out.
Hey!|Ahh, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you!
Hey!|Yes, you will be very sad. All right, well I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?|Yeah, why not?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.|Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No reason, except…she…told…me.|Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.|Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.|You're sure? You're absolutely sure?
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.|Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.|Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word.
Hey!|Hey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Drums?|No! Drums!
|I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
|Oh-kay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.|I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?|You need to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!|No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.|You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth.|Of course, sir.
Okay.|How did it go?
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?|No.
Well, I do, so let's...  So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?|Christmas.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?|Christmas eve.
Yes, but also  Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.|Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.|Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.|Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Okay, it's not a contest.|When is Santa coming?
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?|No Santa? Was I bad?
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.|Santa's mad at me.
No, hey-hey, come on,  Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!|So Santa's coming?
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!|How do you know so much about this?
I don't know.|Richard used to do it, didn't he?
We'd be eating our soup right now.|Mustached bastard…
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!|Excuse me...
|
Ha!|So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Ha!|Hey-hey, Pheebs, check it out, we already learned a song.  Ready? One, two, three, four...
Tequila!!|That's fun.
Here you go.|Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Thank you.
Here you go.|Thank you.  Hey Pheebs!
Here you go.|Hey!
Here you go.|Here.  Now I only owe you $49.50.
Here you go.|Hey Pheebs!
Here you go.|Hey!
Here you go.|If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?
Here you go.|It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, "Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!" I mean, it is so annoying.
Here you go.|Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.
Here you go.|Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?
Here you go.|Maybe on some level.
Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.|What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.|
Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.|Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  Okay, what is it?
Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.|It's a…tarantula!  Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?
What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?|Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.|
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?|Our apartment is ready.
And that makes you angry because…|Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Where did you get that?|Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Phoebe?|Hm?
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!|Fish!
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.|Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.|We did have fun, didn't we?
We did!|Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Oh, I would love to!|Yay, okay!
Good, good, good, good, good.|Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Hey!|Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
No, these are my pants.|Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?|Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!|What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.|Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.|Texas?
Wow! Thanks!|You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.|You are? Me, too!
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.|Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.|Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?
Cool!|Yeah!
Cool!|Come on Ben.
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...|Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...|Santa!
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...|Hey!
What are you doing here, Santa?|Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?|What?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?|Did you bring me any presents, Santa?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?|You bet I did, Ben, put it there!  Ho, ho, ho!
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?|Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.
What are you doing?|You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.|Why?
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.|But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.|Fine, I'll give the suit back.
|Santa? Really?
Yes, is that okay?|Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
No.|Then it's okay!
No.|Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!
No.|No! Why does he have to go?
No.|Because, if Santa and the Holiday…Armadillo?  ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!
No.|No! Why can't the Armadillo leave? I want Santa!
No.|Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.
No.|Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?
No.|Okay, Santa!
No.|All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.
Oh wow! Look at this place!|Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!
Oh my God!|What?
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?|Yeah?
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?|Yeah?
Do you really not know where I’m going with this?  It left! It’s one huge room!|Oh no!  Oh! Wow!!!
See?|Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.
You can’t, because of the new skylight!|There’s a skylight?!  Wow!!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?|Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?|A little bit, yeah.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?|You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.|Are you sure?
Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.|Oh me too.
I know.  Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?|No, I do not hear that.
…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…|Eight whole days.
That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.|Awesome!
Yeah?|My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles!|Hey!
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles!|Oh.
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles!|Wow! It looks like the Easter Bunny’s funeral in here.
Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!|Oh.
Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!|Oh.
Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!|Okay, I understand why Superman is here, but why is there a porcupine at the Easter Bunny’s funeral?
I got it!|Is it back in the cage?
Its back in cage!|Cage closed?
Ohh. Mmm.|Hi.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.|Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.|Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.
I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.|Why, why not?
Because it's too delicious.|Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.|Oh, I’m sorry what?
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.|So…
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?|Absolutely!
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Okay.
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Oh, what’s at 8:00?
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Duly noted.
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Thanks.  Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
I’ll see you at 8:00.|What are you talking about?
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Cousin Frannie’s wedding, its tomorrow night.
I’ll see you at 8:00.|You were invited?!
I’ll see you at 8:00.|No.
I’ll see you at 8:00.|My God, I can’t believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie’s made some new friends.
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Well l-look okay, it’s probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y’know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn’t have stopped her, there probably wouldn’t even be a wedding to go too.
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Y’know, she tried to undress me too.
I’ll see you at 8:00.|I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!|Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?
Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.|Big Daddy?
Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.|Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.|Hey!
Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!|Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!|Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!|Phoebe he’s right, that is the rule.
I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!|Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Well, it does.|Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry.  How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!
Okay, you wore me down.|Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Okay, you wore me down.|The Ross—Is that back?!!
Hi!|Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?|I can’t seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?|Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling…  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!|Y’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.|Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Awww! Mel Torme died.|Joey, that paper’s like a year old!
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!|Hey.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey.|So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn’t a mistake. Ahh, there’s-there’s limited seating in the hall.
Hey.|Limited seating?!  I am just one tiny person!
Hey.|Well yeah, but she doesn’t know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would’ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
Hey.|Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That’s not the reason she’s not inviting me!
Hey.|Oh what’s the big deal?! I wasn’t even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y’know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we’ll-we’ll leave early as a sign of protest.
Hey.|Joan?
Hey.|Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
Hey.|Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn’t invited and you got "and guest?!"
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…|Not broad backed!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…|Wait a minute, y’know, you’re bringing me!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…|What? I can’t cancel on Joan!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…|Why not?!
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…|Bec—Did you not hear me?! She’s an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They’re wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…|Because! She’s my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We’re family y’know? Well that’s important to me.
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…|Okay, all right, I’ll take you. I’ll go call Joan.
Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.|We’ll see.
Well, thank you for lunch.|What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!
So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?|
Mrs. Braverman must be out.|She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.|No that could kill her.
Well, we don’t want that.|No so we’re protecting her.
But we should take it.|But we should move quick.
Why?|Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Oh my God! That’s David!|David who?
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!|Oh my God!
Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.|Phoebe?
David!  What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?|Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?|Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Yeah.|Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make…
Uh-huh.|Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn’t know whether I should call or not, y’know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y’know, I didn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and—but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me.
Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.|Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Really?|I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk…
Uh-huh.|That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it’s actually of Lenin. But, y’know at certain angles…
Yeah.|Umm, anyway…Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Yes! Oh no!|Oh. Uh, what?
I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?|Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y’know, next time you’re in Minsk umm…
I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?|Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
Uh-huh.|What are you doing?
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.|So! He’ll understand!
No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!|God, you are so strong.
Oh my God! That is so good!|I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.
Oh my God! That is so good!|Hey!
Hey!|What do you got there?
Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?|What are you doing tonight?
Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?|Huh? Uh…
Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?|Dude! Dude!
Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?|Oh!  Sorry. Uh, I’ve got those plans with Phoebe, why?
Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?|Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?|What?! Tonight?!
Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?|That’s what Monica said.
Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?|After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she’s trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.|Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut.  Hi!
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.|Hi!
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.|I’m Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.|Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.|Used to work with her. Used to! I’m a relative and I didn’t get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.|So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.|We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.|Okay, you’re fine.
Hey!|Hey!
Are you guys ready?|Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.
Okay.|Okay.
And for you sir?|Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?
It’s uh, it’s already been roasted.|Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
It’s uh, it’s already been roasted.|Oh Joey, we’ve heard the specials three times! Okay? There’s prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.|Oh well, that changes everything!  Y’know what Pheebs?
Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.|Huh?
Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.|You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.|Yeah, I’m very wise. I know.
Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.|Y’know-y’know what I really want?
Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.|What?
Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.|Is to have a long, long talk. Y’know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
Any progress?|Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Any progress?|God Joey, this is taking forever!
Any progress?|What’s the rush? What?
Any progress?|W-w—I just—it’s that—I have—y’know I have-I have an appointment. And it’s very important.
Any progress?|Whoa-whoa, what is it?
Any progress?|Well… It’s a date.
Any progress?|A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn’t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
Any progress?|Come on Joey, don’t make me feel badly about this.
Any progress?|No, I’m gonna!! That’s right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin’ out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you’re doing the same thing!
Any progress?|That—It’s not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he’s very special to me.
Any progress?|Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
Any progress?|She was?
Any progress?|Well, she graduated from high school!
Any progress?|Okay, whatever. Y’know what? I don’t have time have time to convince you because he’s only here for four hours, and I’m gonna go see him!
Any progress?|Fine!
Any progress?|Yeah!
Any progress?|Fine!
Any progress?|Yeah!
Any progress?|What are you still doin’ here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
Hey!|Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn’t think you were coming.
Oh, I wouldn’t miss this.|Well, I’m very glad you’re here.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!|
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.  How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!|Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Y’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I’m takin’ it back!|What?! What?!
Oh yes!|Wait a minute!
Oh yes!|Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don’t!
Oh yes! Oh yes!|You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!|What? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
What do we use to split it?|Okay!  All right, pick a half.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh… There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured…|Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
All right, I’ll pick that one.|That’s also the smaller piece.  Oh!!!!
Ohhh!|Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Ross, sweetheart!|Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Ross, sweetheart!|Isn’t it a beautiful wedding?!
Ross, sweetheart!|Yes, yes it is. It’s uh…  Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
Ross, sweetheart!|Here’s Frannie. Hmm, won’t she be happy to see me?
Ross, sweetheart!|Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn’t bring you here so you can ambush her.
Ross, sweetheart!|Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
Ross, sweetheart!|That bitch!
Ross, sweetheart!|Monica! What…
Ross, sweetheart!|Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
Ross, sweetheart!|Hi Frannie, congratulations.
Ross, sweetheart!|You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What—Why wouldn’t you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?!  Stuart!
Ross, sweetheart!|I believe you know my husband.
Ross, sweetheart!|So it’s really a question of who could you have possibly done.
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can’t miss my flight.|Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like…
July. Umm,|That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?
Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.|That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.|You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.
I-I do though.|I do too.
Bye Phoebe.|Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
Bye Phoebe.|No! No! No Pheebs, I’m not gonna yell at you. I just y’know, started thinking about you and David and I…remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just… Oh Pheebs, come here.  Are you okay?
Bye Phoebe.|No I’m not okay. The only guy I’ve ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never…I may never see him again.
Bye Phoebe.|Hey, y’know you could always visit him.
Bye Phoebe.|Oh right, like they’re gonna let me have a passport.
Bye Phoebe.|Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
Bye Phoebe.|Well—But—Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y’know before he does, then he can come back.
Bye Phoebe.|I can give it a shot.
Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!|Stick to your side!
Hey, come on now!|
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.|What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.|Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.|Well…
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.|Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.|Why?! Why on the lips?!

Monica!|She’s sleeping.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?|Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I just…can’t sleep. Ooh!|It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…|Beep!
Rachel!! Monica!!|Come on!
I can’t believe this!!|All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!!|Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Shhhhhhhhh!!!  I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.|With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!|Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway.
Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!|Okay that does sound like fun.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?|The second sister dies?!
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.|The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.|Sure.
Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?|If this is your idea of sexy talk?
No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?|What contracts?
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.|Like what?
Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?  Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!|Rach, I’m sorry, but you didn’t give me any contracts!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy.|I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.
Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.|No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!|You wanna go down to the office right now?
No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.|Okay I understand.  I wouldn’t want to be proved wrong either.
All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck.|Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump.  Yeah. Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there…you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!|Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?|Well, I’m gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility.
I don’t know Ross! I-I tell you what, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?|Oh, all right.  Can you-can you see what it is?
No.|Okay. Well, you be careful.
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg.|Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!
Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about?|What? What? What?
Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.|Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got—Ohh!  And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
It’s my sister.|Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?|In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it  that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
It’s not here.|Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
How could I have left them in the copy room?|I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.
Fine.|Thank you.  I still don’t get it.
Are you still awake?|Yeah! You?
You do know that was me who just said that right?  Hey. As long as we’re both up…|I hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!|Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.
Yeah? Really? No one’s home?|I don’t think so. Hello?
What?! What are you doing?!|Do you know what just happened?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.|No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!|Monica?
What?!|I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!|Okay.
Give me the good stuff.|Yeah!  And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh…  …fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?|Still no luck.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!|Do you want me to check again?
Well yeah, I wish that you would.|Well, it’s not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
|Any luck?
Can I see you in my office for a minute?|Y’know what? I’m not even going to gloat. I’m just really relived this whole thing is over.
You put these on my desk!|I did not!
Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!|How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!|Phoebe Buffay?!
Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?|We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
That’s not mine.|Yes it is.
How do you know?|The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don’t wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!|Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them.
Fine!  But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!|There’s a reset button under the plastic cover.
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?|Yeah!
Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now.|All right! Just hurry up!
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.|I think face to face.
I would say that.|Face to face, yeah!
Okay, here I go.|All right.
Okay, here I go.|Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.|Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.
So what do you want me to do?|Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Hi.|Hi.
M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.|Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
It’s still looks pretty far!|It’s not that far! Just drop!
Do not rush me!!|Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I’m not wearing any underwear!
That really was some of your best work.|Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.|Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes…
Really?!|Do you wanna?
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!|Brian Buckner & Sebastian Jones
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!|Sherry Bilsing & Ellen Plummer
Hey.|Hey.
What are you doing?|Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Why would you want to do that?|So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Rach, there is a decent place to…|And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
No. No. No.|No?
No. Rosita does not move.|I’m sorry, Rosita? As in…
As in Rosita does not move.|Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.|Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem?|No!  You bitch!
Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That’s weird isn’t it?|Couldn’t I just say, "This is Ross?"
Sure, do whatever you want.|Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section…
Yeah?|Look at this.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!|What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!|I can’t believe mom and dad are selling the house!
I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!|I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!
Who did you leave a message with?|
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.|I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.|She’s not even cold yet!
But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.|That’s true.
Okay? You ready?|Yeah, I…  I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.
I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.|Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.
They kept your room for a while.|Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Come on, you know they love you.|As much as they love you?
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey!
Hey.|Ugh, I hate this year!
What’s wrong with this year?|Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
What’s wrong with this year?|That was me and Ross.
What’s wrong with this year?|Oh that’s right!
Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.|Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.
Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.|Yeah and yeah, and it would probably be better than the last telephone job I had. Y’know, I probably wouldn’t have to say spank as much.
What?|Oh yeah, like you never called!
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.|Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Why don’t we do a trial run.|Oh okay. Umm, all right.  Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
I’m the supply manager.|Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
We don’t need any toner.|Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.  Yeah you’re right, this is easy.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?|Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
They’re always going to tell you they don’t need toner, but that’s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.|Oh.
So, I think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?|No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Dad?|I’m here!
Hey!|Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.|Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.|I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.
Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.|Oh, that’s okay, I can’t wait to see everything again! All of the memories…
Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.|Well, I don’t know what’s in the boxes down here, but I do know there are six or seven Easy Bake Ovens in the attic.
Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.|I used to love to play restaurant.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.|Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.|So, I think you’re boxes are over here.
Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?|I don’t know. They-they must be your mother’s, but please, please don’t ask her. I’ll throw these away.
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad,  Oooh, my rock polisher!|Oh look, look there’s your old makeup kit!
It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!|Well, the white seems to be untouched.  Uh-oh.
What?|Y’know how the garage floods every Spring?
How are you ever going to sell this place?|I think I accidentally used Monica’s boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What… Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!|You don’t secretly smoke do you?
No!|So it’s just your mother then.
I don’t need any toner.|I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Not me.|May I ask why?
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?|I surely do!
Okay, I don’t need any toner because I’m going to kill myself.|Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner?
Okay, so…no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.|No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Well…I only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.|Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!|Chandler?
I-I’m sorry?|No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|You will like it!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|No I won’t.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|You don’t even know!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Because, I know what I like and what I don’t like! It’s not the same thing!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Well look, if you don’t like this…
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|I don’t know why you say that so soon.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Come on Joey, I just bought you a new chair! The most expensive one in the store! Hey, y’know what I was thinking? We could name her Francette.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Francette? What is she? A couch?
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Poor thing. Cut down in her prime.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Joey, the new chair will be here in an hour. Maybe we should actually move Rosita out of here. Y’know, start the heeling process?
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Well, I guess you’re right. Maybe, maybe I’ll take her down to the incinerator. It’s gonna be so said, and kinda cool.  She’s heeled!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|That’s weird.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|No it’s not weird, it’s a miracle!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|It’s not a miracle Joey! I’m sure there’s some explanation.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Oh there is! If you want something enough and your heart is pure, wondrous things can happen!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Joey, I really don’t…
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Can you tell me how this happened?
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Well no.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Miracle!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|No, y’know what? Maybe somebody came in here and fixed it! Or something!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|Someone like an…angel?
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|That’s right Joey, the chair angel came in and heeled your chair.
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|
Well, she’ll understand right? It’s not like I did it on purpose.|Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?|Well, can you blame her?
Well I don’t know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could…|Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.
Really?|Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.
Great!|Like uh y’know like this! This!  She-she could’ve made this!
Sure!|Right? And this!  She-she could’ve won this!
This could’ve been hers!|Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!|Yeah, me too.
Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?|Fine.
Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!|No. Really?
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!|My chair heels itself.
Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!|Hey guy!
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.|No! That’s just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He’s the worst! I’d like to take him with me!
All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?|Yeah! Right!
Oh sorry, boyfriend!|Oh no.
No, whatever! Anything!|Hey guy!
Yeah, he’s gotta go.|Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!|The new girl’s good.
Hey guys! Hey!|Hey.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.|That’s a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.|Oh, this will make a great memory.
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?|Well, these. These are yours right here.
Okay.|Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.|Nu-uh!
Oh, an old glove?|Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Wow! Look at this!|Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.
These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?|Umm, your boxes are umm…
What?|Dad?
What?|Well, the garage flooded sweetie and it ruined everything in your boxes. I’m sorry.
Just mine?|I’m afraid so.
So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined?  And if you say the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!|Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!|There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
I can’t believe this!|
Hey Chandler!|Hey!
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?|Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?|Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.|That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!
Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…|Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?
Yeah.|I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!
Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!|Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Noo!  Angels.|I’m gettin’ my chair back!
What? Wh-hey!|Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
What? Wh-hey!|Joey you broke my chair!!
What? Wh-hey!|Your chair?!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!|So, there was no miracle?!
No Joe, no miracle.|Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!|I think I should get the chair!
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!|How do you figure?
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!|Because you  broke a chair! The only one around here that hasn’t broke a chair, is me!
No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.|Well, where’s the logic in that?!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!|So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!|That’s right!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!|What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!|Yeah! We are!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.|Sorry, I don’t know any Earl.
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.|I’m right here!!!!
Earl! I’m Phoebe.|Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself.|Look, um I really appreciate your coming down…
No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!|Why?!
Because it was fate that made me call you today!|I thought it was toner.
No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.|Really?!
Yes.|How?
I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.|Couldn’t it just be a coincidence?
No, it’s fate!|It doesn’t really seem like enough to be fate.
Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.|I’m actually the office manager.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.|Well, was there anything else?!
Sure!  Umm, where are you from?|Philadelphia.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps.|Really?
Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.|Yeah-yeah.
But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!|I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.
Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place.  Oh no, it’s you.|Yeah.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this.  What do you think this is?|All right. I think it was a mouse.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this.  What do you think this is?|How are you honey?
How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!|Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I’m sorry about everything that happened and I’d probably never be able to make it up to you, but here’s a start.
What’s this?|It’s the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
What?!|What?!!!
What?!|I’ve been thinking about getting rid of it. I was driving it the other day and saw my reflection in a store window. Your mother’s right, I do look like an ass.
Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!|Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!|Why don’t we take it for a spin?
All right!|Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!
Oh yeah.|Ahhhh….
Ahhh……  Eh?|Uh-huh.
Ahhh……  Eh?|Hey guys!
Ahhh……  Eh?|Hey!
Hey!|Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?
Hey!|Oh yeah, Joey broke it. Had to get rid of it.
Hey!|Are you kidding?! I get a Porsche and the barca lounger’s gone?! This is the best day ever!
Hey!|Sherry Bilsing & Ellen Plummer
Hey!|Vanessa McCarthy
Happy birthday!!!|Happy birthday!!!
Happy birthday!!!|Rach! Come on! Rach!
Happy birthday!!!|It’s your birthday!
Happy birthday!!!|Hey.
Happy birthday!!!|She’s not as pretty as she was when she was 29.
Happy birthday!!!|Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don’t use the words old or downhill or
Happy birthday!!!|They do!
Happy birthday!!!|Rachel! Come on out! Monica made breakfast!
Happy birthday!!!|Chocolate-chip pancakes!
We’ve got presents!|Good ones?
We’ve got presents!|They all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.
We’ve got presents!|Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?
We’ve got presents!|Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.
Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam.|Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?|No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.
Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…|Yeah, you’re roommate is a soap opera star.
Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…|Look, y’know I know my life’s going pretty well, but I look around and I just see so many people who’ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they’re thirty.
Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…|Yeah, but you shouldn’t compare yourself to me.
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!|There you go!
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!|I did it! One mile on a hippity-hop! That’s it!! That’s everything I wanted to do before I was thirty. Oh, except I wanted to patch things up with my sister. But oh well. Yay!!
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!|Come on, let’s have some fun. Huh?  What do you want to do today?
Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.|Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.|Hey! That was a practical purchase! I needed that car for transportation! Okay? I-I have a child!
How hot do I look in this, huh?!|Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.|Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?
I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!|I can’t believe you bought this.
I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!|Really! God Ross, what were you thinking?  I know it’s really shallow, but a part of me wants him again.
I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!|Oh, well get in line missy.  So, can I have a ride stud?
Damnit!|Okay, who’s next?
Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.|Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.
So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it——Ow! Son of a bitch!!|Look Rachel, I know what you’re going through. I’m totally freaked about turning 25.
Get out, get out of my apartment.|All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well.
Get out, get out of my apartment.|Least of all you.
Get out, get out of my apartment.|Why? What you’d do?
Get out, get out of my apartment.|Weren’t you asked to leave sonny?
Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!|But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple.
Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.|You’ve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!|It’s older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Ohh!|Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!|Crap.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what’s going on.|Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Hey-hey are you drunk?|Nooo!  I wanna puke on you later!
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!|Noo!!!
Yes!|Noo!!
Yes!!|Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.|Really?! You promise?
Yeah, I’ll take care of it.|Okay. I love you so much.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.|What about your breath?!
That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.|Okay. I can do that.
Okay.|Surprise!!!
Okay, forward. Forward—Stop!  Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!|Ross, just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in.
Okay, forward. Forward—Stop!  Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!|Is this yours?
Okay, forward. Forward—Stop!  Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!|Well actually…
No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine.|Dude, you soooo need this car.
No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine.|
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here!  It’s for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!|Right, why do you keep saying that?
Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.|Yeah, no we’re not thirty. We’re 31. Okay.
Wait!|Oh, it’s you.
Yeah. What?!|Yeah, we’re not thirty, we’re 31.
Nu-uh!|Yea-huh! That’s what is says on my birth certificate.
You have your birth certificate?|Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Our mom.|
Do you have my birth certificate?|No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.|Yeah.
I just lost a whole year of my life.|Okay.
Your middle name is Pamela?|Yes.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?|Yes! Phoebe.
That’s my first name.|Right, okay, then no.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.|Yay!
See?|Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
See?|Don’t get up Jack! The safety pins are about to blow.
See?|Paul!
Phil.|Phil!
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.  you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.|Hey, what’s going on?
Monica’s a little drunk.|Yay! I love drunk Monica!
Monica’s a little drunk.|Awwwww…
She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.|Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her.
She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.|What’s-what’s going on? Phil’s really pissed!
Monica’s wasted.|Maybe that will liven up this party.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!|Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!|Yep.
This one’s from me.|Ahh!
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|Stick to the list. Always stick to the list.
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|No! No-no, I love it. Thank you.
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|Okay.
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|Now that you’re a couple, we don’t get two presents from you guys?
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|For my last birthday you gave me a hug!  Okay, read the card! Read the card!
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|Okay.  That’s funny, yeah!
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|No, I know! I get it! It’s funny!
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|No, because you’re not a grandmother!
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|No I know, because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and I don’t have any of those things. That’s why it’s so funny.
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|All you had to do was buy the card!
Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?|Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.
What?|Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…
What?|Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.
What?|As I was saying… I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I’m 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!
What?|If you could do that, I’d marry the hippity-hop.
What?|So, if I wanna have my kid when I’m 35, I don’t have to get pregnant until I’m 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant…
What?|Really! That long?!  Look all you want, it’s happening!
What?|No, so I don’t have to get married until I’m 33! That’s three years, that’s three whole years—Oh, wait a minute though. I’ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I’d like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged… Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I’m thirty.
Which is fine! Because you just turned——twenty-eight!|No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
Which is fine! Because you just turned——twenty-eight!|Will you quit hoggin’ it!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|There we go.
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Did I not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready?
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|How are you feeling?
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|You are so handsome! I wanna make love to you right here, right now!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|I really wish that you wouldn’t.
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay? Then we can put you in bed, okay? Just smile and don’t talk to anyone.
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Speech! Speech! Let’s hear from the birthday girl! Huh?
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Pheebs!!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Don’t you see? Everyone’s looking at me! The plan’s working! I didn’t even have to take off my top yet!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Speech! Come on Monica!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Come on!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Come on! Speech!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Hey Chandler, you can’t keep your hands off her for one second!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Oh-ho, I think it’s nice.
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|I think it’s necessary.
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|I-I-I wanna thank you all for coming. My family and my friends…
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Wooo!! Hoo!!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|I really like to say that I’m-um…
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|Yeah!!
I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!|Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?|That’s not gonna happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!|Like what?
Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!|Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks.|Hey.  Oh, poor Pheebs.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks.|Hey, y’know what you guys? I think I’m gonna go walk her home.
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks.|Oh man!
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks.|What?
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks.|He’s gonna eat the cake!
Pheebs! Wait up!  Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list.|Oh yeah.
Oh, and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese.|Oh!
Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!|Ross, I really don’t think…
Lift!! And slide!|Okay, here we go.
Hey Joey, can I…|Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.|Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother.|Okay!

Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I don’t…|Wait! I think I see where you’re going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun.|Rachel, don’t do this. This is just because you’re turning thirty.
Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!|Twenty-four actually.
Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.|Me too.
Hey! How’d it go?|Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Hey! How’d it go?|You did the right thing.
Hey! How’d it go?|
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.|God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.|

Do you mind telling us what it is?|So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and…
What is DOOL?|Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
What is DOOL?|Oh!!
What is DOOL?|That’s great!
What is DOOL?|And-and-and not only that, I’m gettin’ a new brain!!
What is DOOL?|So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
What is DOOL?|Wait, what do you mean you’re getting a new brain?
What is DOOL?|Oh well, they’re killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
What is DOOL?|What? A brain transplant?!
What is DOOL?|Yes, it’s a highly controversial procedure.
What is DOOL?|It’s ridiculous!
What is DOOL?|Well, I think it’s ridiculous that you haven’t had sex in three and a half months.
What is DOOL?|
Who are they killing off?|Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
Who are they killing off?|Noo!!
She’s my favorite character on DOOL.|Nice.
She’s my favorite character on DOOL.|She is so good at throwing drinks in people’s faces, I mean I don’t think I’ve ever seen her finish a beverage.
And the way she slaps all the time!|Oh!
Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?!|Don’t do it.
Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?!|Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?!|Oh, tell me about it. And she’s been on the show forever, it’s gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?!|Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?!|Yes, but in Drake Remoray’s body.  Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?|Well, I'd have to say gay.
Yeah? Why?|Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.|Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
|All right, straight, and not subtle.
Ohh, he left his cell phone.|Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.|What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.|What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.|Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together… having sex.|Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.|Yeah!  And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again.
Nice try.|Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
I don’t know.|Well umm, maybe we could uhh…  Ah-ha! Too slow!!
I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!|Oh yes there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!|That was an accident! And so were you.
Well, at least I’m not a murderer!|
Well, at least I’m not a murderer!|Cut!
Well, at least I’m not a murderer!|That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
Well, at least I’m not a murderer!|Oh, just years of experience.
Can I get some ice here?!|Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
Can I get some ice here?!|You’re not the fan who’s dying are you?
Can I get some ice here?!|Say what?
Can I get some ice here?!|I’m supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that’s not supposed to be until  later!
Can I get some ice here?!|No. No, I’m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I’m the guy in the coma!
Can I get some ice here?!|Oh that was a real person?!
Can I get some ice here?!|An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I’m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me…
Can I get some ice here?!|I-I-I’m leaving the show?
Can I get some ice here?!|I don’t know. Why? Did you hear something?
Can I get some ice here?!|Who told you that?
Can I get some ice here?!|Oh uh, one of the writers.
Can I get some ice here?!|Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
Can I get some ice here?!|Umm…
Can I get some ice here?!|Y’know what? It doesn’t matter! Because it is not true!
Can I get some ice here?!|Okay.
Can I get some ice here?!|And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I’ve been playing for 20 years—I’ll give you a tip!
Can I get some ice here?!|Ms. Monroe…
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.|Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
I don’t think so.|Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.|Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.|Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
Yes okay.  Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!|Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.
Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.|So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?
What is that?|I think it’s the dying cat parade.
It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.|Oh my God!
What?|Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You’re half Scottish right?"
Nooo!!|Yes!!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!|Why is your family Ross?!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!|If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Hi Pheebs!|Hi!
How are ya?|Good.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?|Yeah.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?|Yeah!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!|Ooh, now you lost me.
You stole the phone!|No I didn’t!
No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?|No.
Phoebe!|That is a different phone.
Oh is it?!  It’s for me!|That is damning evidence.
Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh  Would you stop doing that?!|Yes, I’m the one who found your phone.
Phoebe! You can’t do th…|
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.|Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
You just said it!|Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Oh Phoebe!|What?! That’s the first time today!
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…|I’m 16.
See you in 2003.|You’re absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that’s it.
I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.|Yeah, thanks.
No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!|Oh you’re right. Thank you! What’s your name again?
Joey.|Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
Joey.|It wasn’t my decision!
Joey.|You were saying?
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?|All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!|You’re so welcome.
Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this?  "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"|Is that supposed to be me?
Yeah.|Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent.
Well, I feel like a snack!|Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.
Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.|What?!
Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.|Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.|No! No-no they’re not. They’re still very angry! But y’know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.|Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more…
Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.|You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.|How did you know about that?!
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!|Were you the ones called the cops?!
That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.|Why not?
Because we hate them.|Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
We have heard you play.|No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.  You try.|Okay!  All right!
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.|Okay. Okay.
Right. He’s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!  Oh well, I’m gonna miss this woman so much. I don’t know what I’m going to do! I mean, it’s been 20 years of my life.|Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented.
I am. I am, but I don’t know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.|Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—Angelina Jolie!
I probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y’know I just got so comfy here! And… Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!|Like-like what?
Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!|Wow!
But… Well now, now’s a different time for me.|Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!"  Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
You think I’m hot?|You own the room.  We should probably get-get uh…
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the…|Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?
No! It’s because that way the camera only sees her!  Do you wanna try it?|Yeah! Okay.
Hey! Hey!|Who is it?
Hey! Hey!|Hi! It’s Tom, I’m here to pick up the phone.
Hey! Hey!|Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
Well why shouldn’t I?!|Because it’s my apartment!
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.|Okay. All right.  Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.|Hi!
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.|Wow! How long were we arguing for?
You’re not the man who left the cell phone.|No that’s my assistant.
Is-is he coming?|Umm, no.
Is-is he coming?|Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
Is-is he coming?|Sure!
We’ll be right back sir.|Sure.
We’ll be right back sir.|Wh-what do we do?
I don’t know!|Can you believe this?  We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
I know!  What?!|Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.|Rachel, listen—I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!|Yeah! You’re such a great friend!
Ohh…|So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Ohh…|Oh that’d be me. Sir.  After you.
Ohh…|Okay. Okay.
Ohh…|Nice!
Well, you certainly own that room.|Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Well, you certainly own that room.|Hi.
Well, you certainly own that room.|Hey!
Well, you certainly own that room.|Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
Well, it’s nice to know that you…|
Well, it’s nice to know that you…|That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
Oh that explains all the women’s underwear.|Sure. Yep.
Oh that explains all the women’s underwear.|Oh my God! It’s true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
Certainly.|Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.|God. You seem really, really nice.
I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.|Okay, bye-bye.
I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.|I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.|All right, here we go.
I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.|Okay.
I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.|Umm, you’re a stupid bitch.
I really can’t slap you.|You are so beautiful.
I really can’t slap you.|Nice to meet you! My God you’re great!
I really can’t slap you.|Thanks for stopping by. See ya!  I-I am so sorry. I…
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I’m used to it, don’t worry about it.|Oh my God!
What?|They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!
They don’t?|Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines!  Oh…
How does it happen?|Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!|Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either.
…now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.|I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?|No!
So?|No!
Loosening the saddle on mother’s horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.|Thank you sweetheart.
I can’t believe she’s really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.|I don’t think so.
Who are you?!|What’s the matter Dina? Don’t you recognize your own  mother?!
Who are you?!|Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
Who are you?!|Ohh, I think that you’re a better Jessica than I ever was!
Who are you?!|Oh noo…
Who are you?!|Well of course not, but you were very good.
Who are you?!|Thanks!
Who are you?!|And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
Who are you?!|Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
Who are you?!|A film in Guadalajara!
Who are you?!|The airport?
Who are you?!|No that’s La Guardia.  This is Mexico.
Who are you?!|Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
Who are you?!|Eight months.
Who are you?!|That’s a really long time.
Who are you?!|Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
Who are you?!|Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.  And I just got what you meant again—That is—I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
Who are you?!|That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You’ve, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
Who are you?!|Good luck.
Who are you?!|You too.

Hi.|Hi! Hi Ben!
Hi.|Hi.
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.|Oh, yeah go ahead.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there?|No. No.
Okay! All clear!|Thanks Phoebe!
Okay! All clear!|Ben, its Rachel!  But whatever.
Everything okay in there?|Don’t talk to me now!
Everything okay in there?|Awww, just like his daddy.
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?|What-what about Monica?
Oh, she isn’t home.|So it would just be, me alone?
Well, Ben would be there.|Huh umm…
What’s the matter?|Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone.
Rach, he’s not an ex-con.|Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.|Okay.
Okay.  Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?|Yeah I think so.
I wasn’t talking to you.|I’ll be okay.
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|Bye dad.
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|Bye.  So this is fun, huh?
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|Not really.
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|Okay. Uh, want something-want something to drink?
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|Okay.
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|Uh great! How do you feel about Diet Coke?
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|I’m not allowed to have soda.
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|Okay. Well that’s pretty much all that we have—Oh! Oh! Have you ever had a virgin margarita?
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|What’s a virgin?
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|Water it is.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.|You mean the spitter?
Come on! It wasn’t that bad!|Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.
All right, what about the third guy?|You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Can you blame him?|Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say, "I do," he’s thinking, "Yeah, I’d do her too!"
Well then we still have a problem.|Yeah!
Well then we still have a problem.|With what?
Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies.|Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade married.|No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Are you serious?|Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!
Are you serious?|I call it!!
Are you serious?|What?! No! It was my idea!
Are you serious?|Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
Are you serious?|Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!
Are you serious?|We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!
Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend.|But you’re not anymore!
No, I’m not.|‘Cause you guys were on a break.
Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?|When’s my daddy coming back?
So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff.|Sharing is good.
Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.|Really? Like how?
Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.|That’s a good one.
Yeah? You like that one?|Yeah, you’re funny.
I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right?  And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.|Can I do it to you?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?|No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?|We’re never gonna find anybody.
Well then let me do it!|Joe…
No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.|Joey look it’s really sweet…
No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!|That is true.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.|Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.|It might be kinda cool.
So I can do it?|Yeah you can do it.
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?|Yeah.
Okay.|Hey Pheebs, how’s it going?
Okay.|Oh, I have a headache. A horrible headache!
Okay.|Oh, I’m sorry. Can I get you something?
Okay.|Oh my God, you’ve got to stop chattering!
Okay.|Here, take a couple of these.
Okay.|What is it?
Okay.|It’s Hexadrin.
Okay.|Oh no, I don’t believe in Western medicine. No, if you just apply pressure to these points right here.
Okay.|Okay, while we’re waiting for these pills to kick in, I’m gonna sit you down on the couch. Come on. —gonna make you some tea. And then, I’m gonna rub your feet.
Okay.|Oh.
Coming.|I have a bone to pick with you.
Uh-oh.|Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old…|That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Oh that.|Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!|I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?|Hexadrin.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin!|No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Say what?|Y’know, the possible side affects.
Oh my God!  Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules!|Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Why?|In case it happens.
Why?|Hey!
Why?|Hey!
Why?|Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani!
Why?|Hey!
Why?|You did it! You got ordained?!
Why?|Yeah, I just got off the Internet! Man, there is a lot of porn out there!
Why?|Our minister…
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!|Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Okay, then I must be disoriented.|Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Okay, then I must be disoriented.|Okay.
Okay, then I must be disoriented.|Yeah!
Okay, then I must be disoriented.|Now-now, listen this is just a first draft so…  "We too can share and love and have and receive."
Okay, then I must be disoriented.|Should we call the spitter?
Hey Rachel!|Hi!
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?|Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Can I ask what—Come on in.|Okay.
Umm uh, I’ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.|I’d love that. I would loooove…  So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Umm uh, I’ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.|
Umm uh, I’ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.|I found him!  That is exactly why I’ve come here to talk to you okay?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Yes oh— Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Don’t do that.
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Don’t do that.
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Seriously, your dad doesn’t like pranks.
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Oh damnit!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Oh damnit!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|No! Don’t say that! Don’t say that!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Damnit!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|No don’t! Go back to repeating!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Damnit!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Oh crap!
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Oh crap!

Yeah.|Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there.
No I-I-I’m fine.|All right, here you go buddy.
That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.|Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.
Oh…  Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!|Yeah, it’s totally meant to be.  Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.

It’s like it was in the stars!|Okay, fine but please don’t be upset! Okay? I was really depressed okay? And really drunk! I just wanted something stupid and meaningless. I just wanted…just sex. So, when I…went to your room that night…I was actually looking…for Joey.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?|No because it-it didn’t seem important.
Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him  not me!|Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him  not me!|And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv—

Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay?|What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bride’s maid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?!  I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.|Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.|This is crazy.
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.|I know! Robin is so gay!
So now what have we agreed?|No more pranks.
And-and what else?|That you and daddy were not on a break.
Very good.|Rachel! What are you doing here?
I’m just visiting my good friend Carol.|Your good friend?
Yeah!|What’s her last name?
Carol…Lesbian?|Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
What line?|Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh,  "Dude, don’t you ever was your face?"
All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!|Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!
All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!|Hey Ross!
All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!|Hi.
All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!|What’s not funny?
All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!|Practical jokes.
All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!|Oh I…I think they’re funny.
All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!|You have a line down your face.
All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!|What?
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you…|Oh my God!
Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!|Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"|I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!|No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…
Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!|Crap!!
Hey.|Hey. Do you want this scone?  It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!|Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…
No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I except that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.|How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.|That’s what you should say.
What?|When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.
Really? I can do it?|I’d love it if you would do it.
Hey!|But those are the words! Those exact words!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…|Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben?
Okay, I’ll see you later pal.|Ohh, okay.  Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it.

Huh.|Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says…
Huh.|Hey Chandler!
Hey!|Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date.
Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!|Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Really? Right across the street?|Yeah!
When’d you meet her?|Two days ago.
Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!|Oh yeah?
Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!|Hey.
Hi! How’d it go?|Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?|Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not to worried about it.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?|Well you shouldn’t be. Believe me I wouldn’t want to be the guy who’s up against you.  I mean that doofus is going to lose!
So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to.  Oh uh, by the way, what’s the name the girl you’re dating?|Kristen Lang.
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.|Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her…|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates her.
That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her…|Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.|Yeah well we should order some food then.
No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.|That sounds fair.
Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…|Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.|All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.
So let’s decide on the spending limit…|Yeah. Uh, …six dollars?
I was thinking more like a hundred.|Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Oh…|I know. Hand me a tissue.
Oh…|You’re out of Diet Coke.
Hello?|What?!
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!|Does that mean Carcass is available?
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?|Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
How?|You’re out of toilet paper!
Hey!|Hey! What’s up?
I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.|Oh thanks!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?|We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed.|I am dressed.
Oh. Well good!  What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?|I have an oily T-zone!
Okay dude!  Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.|That’s right.
You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!|Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!|Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
I don’t know.|Why am I not surprised?
Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!|I don’t think you have much choice.
Well we’ll see!|Bye-bye!
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?|Yes. Yes. Just here .
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!|Yeah, swing music is so out.
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!|Phoebe, he’s gotta be in the room for that to work.
What are you guys talking about?|Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.
What are you guys talking about?|Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I’m not saying that there’s any connection here y’know, but they did tell me that’s why they got divorced.
But I love swing music!|Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.|Well, what is the other reason?
I don’t want to say.|Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.|Oh crap!
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.|Oh great!
Yeah.|Is your back feeling better?

Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?|No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?|Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!|Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!

Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it.  Wow! You-you look…hideous.|Really?
Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?|Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!|Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little.

…and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator.  Yes Mr. Lewis?|What kinda noise?
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.|But like how?
Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this.  Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?|Yes sir.
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I’m afraid I-I had to fail you.|Why?!
Well you need 60% to pass…|What’d I get?
Seven.|That’s not so good.
No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?|Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I’m sort of in love.
Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem.|I’m in love with you.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.|You see, that’s why I did so bad on this test. I’m having a hard time concentrating. When you’re up there  You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater…
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!|Really?  My God, he’s really cute.
Go for it.|Phoebe, I’m engaged!
I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.|Hi!
I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.|Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I’m engaged.
I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.|Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.|Well you should be embarrassed.
I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.|I thought you knew I was looking at you.
my parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel…|I’m fourth!  Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this.|What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Really?|Yeah.
What award are you practicing for?|Grammy, Best New Artist.
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today and I also get to present an award.|Ohh that’s great!
Yeah!|So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win.
What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?|Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.|Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like…
Hey!|Y’know?
You practice losing the Grammies too?|Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Oh hey!|Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?
Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.|Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.
All I could think of was y’know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"|And did he?
I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.|Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.|Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?
You sound like a guy.|No, a guy would be saying, "I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?|Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.|Whoa!
There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.|Whoa what?
There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.|Ross has a boyfriend.
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.|Really?
Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe?|Not right now.
It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.|Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.|Yeah.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.|How’d you get over that teacher?
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.|I didn’t. I got under him.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.|Problem solved.
Bye Phoebe.|Okay bye.
All right. Bye.|Bye!  We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
All right. Bye.|Phoebe, it’s okay. You don’t have to tip toe around me. I-I’ve been thinking about it and umm, y’know what? I’m okay about not having that new relationship feeling…
I miss you already!!|
I miss you already!!|See? That’s what I mean. I mean that, that’s great! But I wouldn’t trade in what I have for that. I mean I’m gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that’s what makes me happy.  Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don’t you think?
I miss you already!!|Oh totally!  Pull my finger.
This is it! This is my category.|I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Yeah, I got my speech!|Do you got your gracious loser face?
Yeah.|Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?|On TV?! Yeah!
…in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are: John Wheeler from General Hospital …Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless!|What the?!
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.|
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!|Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Oh my God you stole her award!|No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf.
Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means.|Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, "I behalfin’ it!"
Joey, you have got to take this back!|But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
No! Joey!|Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em.
Do you really want an award you didn’t win?|No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those! Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there  right? When people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!|I can scratch that right off.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.|All right!
All right?  Thank you.|I’ll take it back tomorrow.
Thank you.|
Professor Geller?|Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
I know I didn’t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.|And why exactly would I do that?
Because I’m in love with you.|What?!
Yeah, I’m all…in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?|No!
Well why not you changed Ned’s grade!|Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
No he’s not! He’s totally yanking your chain! He’s done this with three other teachers!|What?
He’s got a girlfriend!|I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
Have you seen Chandler?|No. Why?
‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.|Okay, don’t sweat it.
Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.|No that is the last thing you want to do!
Why?|Because you’re marrying him!
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.|All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?|That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Your mother told you this?|Yes!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?|Oh my God! You’re right! Go!
I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!|Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Okay, I’m totally cool!|Come in.
Okay, I’m totally cool!|Hey Jessica.
Hey Jess.|Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
Hey Jess.|Hi.
‘Sup?|Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
‘Sup?|
‘Sup?|Well, that-that-that’s it? You’re gonna, you’re gonna put it on your self or anything?
‘Sup?|No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you’ll excuse me.
‘Sup?|Take it back?
Absolutely.|Y-y-yeah!
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?|Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?|Kinda. They’re really big.
Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?|What?
Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?|No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?|Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even more sweating.
Even with me?|I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Really?|Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Come here! Come here!  Sweetie you don’t have to worry. No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…|Water! Water! Water!
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?|That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back.|What?! Why?
‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work.|I’m not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Rach?|I’ll be out in a second.
Oh.  It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in…|Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
…in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon.|Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go.
Oh hey! How was your audition?|I’m sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?|Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star!
Oh! You got it?!|Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
Oh! You got it?!|What was it for?
Oh! You got it?!|Oh, it’s this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It’s really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
The next, next?|Yeah, there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy’s right after him.  Hello!
The next, next?|Joey! It’s Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
The next, next?|They loved me!
The next, next?|Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
The next, next?|Oh my God!
The next, next?|There’s just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
The next, next?|Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it!
What’s the matter?|They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
What’s the matter?|Wow!
What’s the matter?|I know! My grandmother’s gonna see this!
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?|Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?|A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?|Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
Sure.|I gotta make up the guest bedroom.  Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Sure.|Cassie?
Sure.|Uh-hmm.
Sure.|Wow, I haven’t seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
Sure.|Ross, she’s 25 years old.
Sure.|So what! I still have—No you’re probably right.
Sure.|Hi!
Sure.|Hey!
Hey!|Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Yeah!|Subtle guys!
What?!|I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.
What?!|Well okay—Well don’t ruin it! Just play along at least!
What?!|Okay. Sorry.
What?!|Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?|I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
That’s what you say about porn.|You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!|Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.
Well when can we have this shower?|She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…
Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?|Yesterday!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!|Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Rachel, calm down!|Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right.
Just calm down woman!|Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.|Okay. Okay.  I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Uh, here. What time?|4 o’clock. Food?
Finger sandwiches and tea.|Ooh great! Very Monica.
And chili!|Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Both!|We’re paying for this y’know.
Neither.|Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Lusts of the flesh.|What?
Hey!|Hey!
Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.|Oh boy me too!
Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…|Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!|The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
That’s me! Come on!|Okay.  But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.|Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.|I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
Hi! Nice to meet you!|Nice to meet you too.
Hi! Nice to meet you!|So, are you ready to go?
Hi! Nice to meet you!|Yeah.
Hi! Nice to meet you!|Chandler!
Cassie needs to stay at your place.|What—why?
Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.|What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!
Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.|I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It’s called being a good conversationalist. Watch.  Say something.
You were staring about eight inches south of there.|Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.|Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Hey, I’m back!|Hi-hi Joey.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?|Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn’t need to come down here today.
Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!|Wait Joey! You didn’t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?|Well, the director thinks you’re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Wow! Sure! That’s great!|Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.|Terrific! Well uh, there’s one more thing. Uhh, uh it’s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she’s never seen a naked man who wasn’t Jewish. So…
So…What?|So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I’m saying?
Yes!|Okay.
No. What?|An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be…
So to get this part you can’t be?|Nope.
But you are?|Yep.
But you told them you weren’t?|That’s right.
Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?|I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!|I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!|I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part.
Unless!|Unless what?
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.|Like what?
Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.|Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?|Hey!
Hey!|Hey! What’s up Mon?
Hey!|Well uh, I’m trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
Hey!|Have at it.
Hey!|Okay.  I hope that won’t work.
Hey!|Are you makin’ him a sandwich?
Hey!|No it’s umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I’m gonna go guys.
Hey!|Okay.
Hey!|I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
Hey!|We have to get her a present?!
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book!  We have a guest list!|Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Cassie?!|Hey Ross!
Hey!|It’s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.|Ah yeah, sorry about that.
It’s okay. Come, come on in.|Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Oh.|Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.|Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.|I’m all done.
Thank God.|I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried?  We’re probably too old to do that now.|I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got all of these freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.|It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Hi!|Hi!
How are you?  Hi, thanks for coming.|Oh thank you.
Thank you.  Oh, it’s so nice to see you.|No.
Thank you.  Oh, it’s so nice to see you.|No thanks.
Okay.  Hey Rach?|Yeah?
Who the hell are all these people?|Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!|Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!|I was her accountant four years ago.
Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!|Ohhhh!
Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!|I’m very interested to find out who’s been doing her taxes these last four years.
Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!|That’s great!
Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!|So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!|I don’t know.
Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!|You didn’t tell her to come?!
You were supposed to tell her!|No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Fine, I’ll go call her.|Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.|Wow! This looks great!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.|And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Oh, just until the glue dries.|Thank God!
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.|Ah.
Okay?  Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.|Well maybe we just take that one away.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me.  Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.|Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me.  Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.|Ow!
Toothpick?|Yeah.
What are you trying on now?|The fruit roll up.
And?|Delicious.
Joey!|Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
What?! Which one?!|The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!
Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in.|Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.|Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
For what?|Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
For what?|And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
You al-you already had it?|Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
You al-you already had it?|Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don’t have either.
You al-you already had it?|We ruined everything.
You al-you already had it?|Ugh…
Well no wait a minute that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.|What do you, what do you mean?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don’t even like!|Surprise…
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don’t even like!|Sur-surprise.
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don’t even like!|…Monica.

My whole family’s from Naples!|Joey, this is awkward part.
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?|Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Oh! No problem! I…|What?
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?|Probably Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?|Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights, please?
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?|Oh umm, uh we don’t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the newsstand across the street.
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?|That’d be great, thanks.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this.|
Melissa!|You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what’s up with you?!
Wh—|So last I heard you were gonna get married.  Oh poor Ray-ray.
Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!|Shut up!
I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!|Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Oh please…|Are you?!
No.|Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um…|You do now. You’re having dinner with me.
Shut up.|I-I’ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray!
Oh, wow thanks!  Oh you’re in real estate!|Oh no, that’s-that’s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Wow! What do you do now?|
Okay!|Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.|She seems really, really fun!
She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.|Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you…
She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.|Who you what? Who you what?!
Yes.|Wow!
Yes.|Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you—what?!!
It’s not a big deal!|They were lovers.
It’s not a big deal!|What?!
It’s not a big deal!|What?!
No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit.|So that’s two of my wives.
|Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me  These pins aren’t for playing are they?
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.|This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Chandler, relax it’s not a contest.  Certainly not a close one.|Hello!
Chandler, relax it’s not a contest.  Certainly not a close one.|Hey!
Chandler, relax it’s not a contest.  Certainly not a close one.|Hey Rach.
Chandler, relax it’s not a contest.  Certainly not a close one.|Stop picturing it!!
Okay, I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they?|Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Oh!  you’re parents will be at home in Queens.|What they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed!
Why would they think they’re invited?|You got me. I don’t…
Joey!|Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’!
Ross’s parents are my parents!|Well-well—see? Parents are comin’!
Ross’s parents are my parents!|Y’know I think we should invite them.
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.|Well this is just sad!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!|That is not a problem.
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!|Maybe you’ll order a little sangria?
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!|Oh, get out of here!
But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.|Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!|Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.|You mean like for award shows?
Some of them.|You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?|Okay, who wore those?
Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.|Not bad.
This one is uh Paul O’Neil.|Who’s that?
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background.  Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!|Pierce Brosnan?
Uh-huh.|Are you serious?
Yeah.|007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!
Yeah.|Oh, I have to get married in James Bond’s tux!
It’s a pretty cool tux.|Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this?
We should really learn how to play the real way.|I like our way. Oh!  Chess!
Nice move.|Yeah.
Nice move.|Hey!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?
No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux.|Well, what are you going to wear?
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.|Huh. Does Monica know about this?
I don’t think so.|Can I please be there when you tell her?
I don’t think so.|Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?
I don’t think so.|Oh, y’know what? I can’t. I have to have dinner with that Melissa girl.
Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera.|What is this? What’s going on?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!|Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!|Joey’s!
Okay…|Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.
Okay…|Yeah, I’m sure that happened.
Okay…|It-it did!
Okay…|Sure!
Hey.  It happened!|Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Hey.  It happened!|Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the cheek.
Why are you taking this away from me?|Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Why are you taking this away from me?|Okay! I just—I didn’t know that you are a lesbian.
Why are you taking this away from me?|I’m not saying that I’m a lesbian! I’m just saying that this happened!
Why are you taking this away from me?|Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you’re so—y’know so…vanilla.
Why are you taking this away from me?|Vanilla?!
Why are you taking this away from me?|Yeah.
Why are you taking this away from me?|I’m not vanilla! I’ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!
Why are you taking this away from me?|To Ross.
Why are you taking this away from me?|All right, y’know what? If you don’t want to believe me about this, why don’t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.
Why are you taking this away from me?|Okay! All right! Yeah! ‘Cause I just can’t picture it.
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!|A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!|What?
That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.|You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!
So?|So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.|Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.|Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
When I got married you slept with my sister.|That was pretty 007.
Hey.|Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Yeah, they’re not coming.|What?!
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.|Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…|Oh Joey!
Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.|No she hasn’t.
Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?|Well, what am I going to say?
I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them so…|
…anyway, his name is Allan and we’ve been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well.  And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.|Oh. Oh, that’s great!
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?|Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
What one?|Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Oh, isn’t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?|Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
What?|Remember?! We—come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…
Yeah?|…we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you’re talking about.|Really?!
Ross is Batman!|Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!|What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Batman has a utility belt!|007 has a fancy car!
Batman has the Batmobile!|007 gets all the ladies.
Batman has Robin!  We get ESPN right?|How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini.
Actually, I don’t like martinis.|How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Ooh, yum!|Hey.
Ooh, yum!|Hey.
Ooh, yum!|Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?
Ooh, yum!|The show?!
Ooh, yum!|Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it’s gonna start a little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?
Ooh, yum!|Have you ever been to one of my weddings?
Ooh, yum!|Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it’s the same day as my niece’s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me. ‘Cause my part’s just in the beginning I’m not even in the rest of the show—Wedding!
Ooh, yum!|The wedding starts at six.
Ooh, yum!|Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little ‘til they get there?
Ooh, yum!|You’ll vamp?!
Ooh, yum!|Yeah! Yeah y’know, like warm up the crowd. Ask ‘em where they’re from. ‘Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an entertainer. I’m a minis-tainer!  There is no one better! There is no one greater!
How can you not remember us kissing?!|I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things that never happened.
Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?|Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.
Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.|I’m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
No!!|Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Thank you Phoebe.|She didn’t.
Thank you Phoebe.|I know.
Hey!|You just carry that around?
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.|Between you and…
Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.|I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.
Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.|A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.|Well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?
What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!|Let me try it on!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.|What’s this?
What?|An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Let me see that!  Oh man!|The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
Let me see that!  Oh man!|Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?
Let me see that!  Oh man!|All right that’s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it! You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and scream racial slurs? I don’t care!
Let me see that!  Oh man!|No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents, that was really sweet. They’re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.
Let me see that!  Oh man!|Oh.
Let me see that!  Oh man!|Well, you’re welcome. And tell them we’re really glad they’re coming.
Let me see that!  Oh man!|Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!  is for party time.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!|Okay.  Take care you guys.
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute!|My God! You love me!
What?|Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin’ together I…
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!|Aww, look who’s being suddenly shy. You can’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!|Shut up!
I’m sorry!|
What the hell was that?!|I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
And?|I’ve had better.
All right! I found one that fits!|Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm.  Aww, look at you all handsome!
Whose is it?|Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Whose is it?|I don’t want to say.
Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?|Diane Keeton.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!|Do you realize you get louder each week?
There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?|I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.|Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.|Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
|Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.
There are no words! This should not be this hard!|All right, uh…  Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
There are no words! This should not be this hard!|Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
Monica what?|What?!
What is the emergency?!|You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.|Thank you.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.|Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.|Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.|Oh! Yeah!
Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.|Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.
...everyone, this is Chandler!|Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
...everyone, this is Chandler!|Okay.
All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?|Ennnh.
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!|Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like…  Or all the things you taught him.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. , five, six, and seven!|That’s one?
It’s kind of an important one!|Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.
It’s kind of an important one!|Well, y’know, sometimes that helps.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica…|Monica…
"…when I look back over our time together…"|Yeah?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|You'll get one.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|Oh yeah? When?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|No, no, no.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|Uh, uh.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|Well?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
|
Nice try.|Wait, wait, wait!
Look, Monica…|Look!
This is not going to work.|I bet this will work!
You are so great! I love you!|What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!|You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!|Yes, you did!
No I didn't!|You love me!
Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?|Then all your stuff would be here.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?|Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
You wanted it to be a surprise.|Oh my God.
Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!|Okay!  Monica, will you marry me?
Yes.|Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey, what have you guys been up to?
Hey!|Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?|How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?|Well let’s just say its she’s lucky she has a sweet ass, ‘cause she’s not so good at the writing.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?|I can’t believe in four weeks they’re gonna be married!
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?|Well let’s just hope it works. Y’know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?|Phoebe that’s not true.
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?|Yeah, you’re right. How’s the Mrs.?
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?|I can’t believe they’ve been together for three years.
Has it been that long?!|Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!|I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?|Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.|Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
Okay.|Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
Okay.|Hey Joe!
Okay.|Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke——Diet Coke.
I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.|I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.
And-and you?!|Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!|It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!|The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!|No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!|Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.|
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…|Arghh!!
Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!|What?!
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!|Oh my God!
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!|OH MY GOD!!!
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!|Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!|I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
YOU KNOW?!!!|Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
YOU KNOW?!!!|What's going on?
YOU KNOW?!!!|Ohhh!!!
YOU KNOW?!!!|HI!! Hi!
YOU KNOW?!!!|What?! What?!
YOU KNOW?!!!|Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
YOU KNOW?!!!|Actually, it looks really good.
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?|Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Bye!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Bye!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Bye Chandler!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Actually, I did!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
Phoebe knows about us!|Well I didn't tell them!
Phoebe knows about us!|Them?! Who's them?
Phoebe knows about us!|Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
Phoebe knows about us!|Joey!
Phoebe knows about us!|And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
Phoebe knows about us!|Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So…
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye!  Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!|Are you kidding?!
No!|I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa!  Joey, do they know that we know?
No!|No.
No!|Joey!
No!|They know you know.
No!|Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey, you can't say anything!|I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!|She's bluffing!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Ooh!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Okay!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|I like that!
Joey!  Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.|It's not my first time.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!|Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?
Oh, you're-you're going?|Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.|You should be. I'm very bendy.  I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.|Ooh.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.|Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!|And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!|You're-you're what?!
Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.|I love you too Chandler.
Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.|I just—I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.|So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.|Well actually, Ross doesn't.
Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.|You really think it would be that different?
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.|Well, things change.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.|I don’t want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.|It’ll be okay Joe.
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.|I’m sorry, I just…I like things the way they are.

Okay, what do you guys think?|Dude!

I stole Monica’s and changed the name.|Brian Buckner & Sebastian Jones
I stole Monica’s and changed the name.|Greg Malins
Hey!|Hey!
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.|Wait a minute!  You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.|Yeah, well he’s my brother! And plus he drives so slow he could never hurt it.
It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!|Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.
It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Saw the Porsche out there Mon, lookin’ good. When do I get to take that baby out again?
Hey!|You let Joey drive it?!
Hey!|I’ve never driven it! Okay? Not once! Okay once. Okay, I drive it all the time.
Hey!|Nice work everybody! So much for the y’know, "You can drive it, but don’t tell Rachel" plan!
Hey!|Wow! I can’t believe you lied to me.
Hey!|Okay, I can fix this! Okay Monica, Rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.
Hey!|Great! Well Rachel, the reason why I won’t let you drive the Porsche is because you’re a terrible driver. There! That wasn’t about the wedding.
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.|Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Whew! That was a brisk ride!|Take the top down did ya?
Only way to fly.|Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!
You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.|Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.|I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.
What?!  Give-give me a brush.|Gimme the keys!
No way!|Well no brush!
Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.|
Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.|Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.
Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.|I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!|Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!|Ooh, I think I wanna trade circles.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!|Trust me, you don’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress.
So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.|Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
My God!|What do you think you’re doing?!
Just washing the windshield.|There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?
Oh.|No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!
Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!|With you?! Yeah right!
All right.|
What are you doing?! Get in the front!|In the death seat?!!
Hey guys!|Hey!
Hey guys!|Hey sweetie!
Ready to go?|Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back.
Wait a minute!|What?
Wait a minute!|So! You and Phoebe huh? How long have you been going out?
Over a month.|Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Sure, I’d like that.|So uh, what’s your name?
Its Jake.|Joey.  Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Its Jake.|Yeah, big fan.
Its Jake.|Me too! There’s a game on Tuesday do you wanna go?
Its Jake.|Yeah that would be great! Let me make sure I’m not doing anything Tuesday.
Here!|What’s this?
It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.|Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!!  We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.|Y’know we already went over this and I won!
No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.|Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…|No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.|He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?|Does it matter?!
Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.|Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.
Yes!|So I really never get to win anymore?
Pheebs!|Hey!
Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?|Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!|I know. They were mine.
Oh.  No! No wait, that’s weird!|No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
That’s weird!|I’m wearing his briefs right now.
That’s…kinda hot.|I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.|And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!|There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.|I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.|Okay whatever.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.|You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax…|What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Uh-oh.|Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Really? You think so?|I was talking to myself! You’re going down!
Has someone taken your order yet?|Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did.  I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t…
Has someone taken your order yet?|Hm-mmm?
Has someone taken your order yet?|Yeah, I just ordered a beer!
Has someone taken your order yet?|You’re straight. I get it.
Has someone taken your order yet?|I still say that if we had called your dad we coulda gotten better seats.
Has someone taken your order yet?|No! No! I don’t want him to know we’re yet! I’m not sure I’m ready for that. And besides he’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.
Has someone taken your order yet?|Why not?!
Has someone taken your order yet?|I don’t know if I’ve told you this, but he’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years
Has someone taken your order yet?|What?!
Has someone taken your order yet?|Yeah, he’s made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y’know it’s all very Cats in the Cradle—I don’t want to get into it.  Here we go.
Has someone taken your order yet?|Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the incomparable Helena Handbasket!
Has someone taken your order yet?|Hello darlings.
Has someone taken your order yet?|And there’s daddy!
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under, you go over!|Yeah, I’ll get right on that.
Oh come on Ross!!|No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?|Oh my God.
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?|Can I see your license please?
Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.|Your license?
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.|That’s Hanson.
Oops sorry, my mistake.|Dear Lord!!
Oops sorry, my mistake.|Wow!
Oops sorry, my mistake.|Here it comes.
Oops sorry, my mistake.|This is a great picture.

I bet you’re a Gemini.|Nope.
Taurus?|Nope.
Virgo?|Nope.
Sagittarius?|Yep.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh….|Well I tell you what…
Yeah?|You’re not gonna speed anymore right?
I won’t speed.|And you promise you’ll get this taken care of right away?
I promise.|And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Yeah!|Can he handle the stick?
Oh well…|I can handle the stick!!
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and…|Gay!
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and…|That can’t be your father.
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and…|Believe me, I’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and…|What?
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and…|That’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
|He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.
|Relax! You’ll be fine.  Oh much better. You’re invisible now.
Where are you from?|Bakersfield.
I’m sorry?|Bakersfield!

|Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh, tress!
Hey Pheebs!|Hey!
Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!|Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.|Uh-huh.
The silk? Feels really good!|Huh.
Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.|That’s great Joe!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear!|Uh-huh.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton, silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about?|Hmm?
Pantyhose! Y’know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here…  I should go take these off shouldn’t I?|I think it’s important that you do.
So what’s your name?|
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must’ve had terribly fascinating parents.|Oh, they’re a hoot.
And who is your friend?|I’m-I’m Monica.
Monica! Where are you from?|New York.
I’m not very fond of New York. Queens I like.  Honey! Huh?|Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Really?! Congratulations. When’s the big day?|In…in two weeks.
So you’re bald?|Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
We?|I know it would make me happy, ma’am.
Well I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Oh! I’m getting all misty here! You’d think I was having my legs waxed or something.|You okay?
Well I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Oh! I’m getting all misty here! You’d think I was having my legs waxed or something.|Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life…  It’s raining men!|Hallelujah!
It’s raining men!|Amen!
It’s raining men!|When I was growing up I…played the one on the far left.
Remind me to introduce you to someone!|Who?
Fourth gear!!|What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position.|Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
It’s a different guy!|Good evening officer.
It’s a different guy!|Do you know how fast you were traveling back there?
It’s a different guy!|Ah no. I don’t, but it could not have been more than sixty.
It’s a different guy!|You’re right. It was 37.
It’s a different guy!|I mean you’re not gonna give me a-a ticket for driving too slow are ya?
It’s a different guy!|That’s right.

He is the man in the black dress.|Can I have everyone’s attention please? I’m uh; I’m Ross Geller.
He is the man in the black dress.|Doctor Ross Geller.
He is the man in the black dress.|Dad…dad, please! As I was saying umm, I’m Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I’m the best man. And uh, this marriage is doubly special for me umm, because not only is the groom my best friend but uh, the bride is my little sister. And, she’s the greatest sister a guy could ask for. So if you’d all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we’re here to celebrate.  To the Bings.
He is the man in the black dress.|To the Bings!
All right, I’m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?|I’ll do it.
Who wants it? Anybody?|I said I’ll do it!
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I’ll do it myself.|Monica! I’m not gonna screw it up!
Y’know what? You’re right, I’m sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.|Well of course that is what I’m here for!
Okay. Sorry.|Ugh!  What grandmother?
Hey! Where have you been?|Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Oh.|What? Are you going back to work?
Yeah.|Nice shades.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won’t get spit in the eyes, y’know?|And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Great! All right. I’ll see you later.|Hey, where’s Chandler?
Uh, I think he’s in Rachel’s room. See ya.|
Hey!|Hi!
Is uh, is Monica here?|She’s steaming her dress, why? What’s up?
I think Chandler’s gone.|What?!
He left that.|Tell Monica I’m sorry.
He left that.|Tell her yourself!
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!|Yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name, y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry.|I think it means he freaked out and left!
Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!|Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!|Look—Okay, I’m just gonna—I’m gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!|Okay.
Okay but if you don’t find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!|I will, I will find him.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?|Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Just the last two pages.|All right.
I found the picture!|Picture? What picture?
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.|Okay uh, look I know you’re a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff…
Oh, thanks.|But you’re spittin’ all over me man!
Well of course I am!|You know you’ve been spitting on me?!
That’s what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!|Wow! Didn’t know that.
Great!|Thanks! Okay-okay check it out!  Eh?
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?|No. No, I haven’t seen him.
Oh damn!|He’s getting married tomorrow right?
Yes. Yes. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We’ll uh, we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding.|I wasn’t invited.
Well then we’ll-we’ll see you the day after tomorrow.  What-what…what you guys doing here?!|Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we’d see what all the fuss is about.
Well then we’ll-we’ll see you the day after tomorrow.  What-what…what you guys doing here?!|I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
Why?!|The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Gunther?!|Your mother just added him to her list.
What? Your-your list?|Yeah, the list that—of people we’re allowed to sleep…
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I’m looking for him?|And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I’m looking for her.
Action!|I found the picture!
Action!|What picture?!
Action!|The picture of my wife! In your pack!
Action!|You went through my personal property?
Action!|Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
Action!|For two years!
Cut! Wonderful!|Great scene yeah?

Cut! Wonderful!|Oh, I’m-I’m not working tomorrow.
Cut! Wonderful!|You are now.
Cut! Wonderful!|No! No! I can’t! You gotta get me out of it! I’ve got plans!
Ross said there’s still no word from Chandler.|Oh man.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.|Okay. Well there’s one down.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.|
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.|Y’know she might not even notice he’s gone.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.|
God! Don’t—We can’t let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…|Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can’t do this here!
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just…It’s just so sad!|Yeah, but you’ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can’t see you like this! Then she’ll know something’s wrong!
I know. I know. Oh God.  There’s no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?|Yeah.  Oh, that’s gone too. This is Monica’s bathroom right?!
Oh!|No-no! I-I…I found one.
Oh thank you!  Can I have another one?|
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn’t show up!|Oh here’s a whole bunch.
Oh, I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y’know? Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.|Oh my God!
What?|There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it’s positive. Monica’s pregnant.  So I guess she won’t be totally alone.
Oh my God!|I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
Oh my God!|Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.|Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this.
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.|Right.
Okay?|Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
No. Why?|Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Anything?|No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler’s parents again!
Anything?|You told them he was missing?
Anything?|No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I’m interested in them.
All right, we’ve got to tell her he’s gone.|No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!
Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!|Well, can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll go back to some of the places I went last night.
All right, well how much time do you need?|Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
One hour.|Give me two.
Then why do you ask?!|Okay, wish me luck.
Then why do you ask?!|Okay. I’m going with you.
Then why do you ask?!|Why?!
Then why do you ask?!|Ross, you’re tired. You’ve been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
All right, I’ll see you guys later.|Okay. Wait, do you know how you’re going to stall her?
I’ll figure something out.|All right. Good luck.
Thanks.|Hey! Okay, so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do my hair.
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.|About what?
Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!|Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.|Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.|Rachel! You okay?
Excuse me, Aaron?  Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s, and I’m officiating so I really can’t work past four.|Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can’t stop filming just for you. It’s not like it’s your wedding.
I’m having surgery!|What?!
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t want you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today.|What kind of surgery?!
Transplant.|But you’re supposed to work on Monday.
Hair transplant.|But you’re not bald.
It’s not on my head.|Look Joey, there’s nothing I can do. Besides, you’re probably gonna be out by four anyway. We’ve just got one short scene. It’s just you and Richard, and God knows he’s a pro. You’ll be fine.  Morning Richard.
Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy, we’ve got a scene to shoot!|I’m wearing two belts.
Are you drunk?|No!
Yes you are!|All right.
We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!|Oh my God! Is that him?
That is an old, Chinese woman!|He could be in disguise, y’know.
So this is your office?|How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!
So this is your office?|What the hell are you doing?!
So this is your office?|Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I’m related to Monica. How is she?
She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.|No! No! No! I can’t do that!
She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.|Why not?!
She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.|Because if I go home, we’re gonna become the Bings! I can’t be the Bings!
What’s wrong with being the Bings?|The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?|No.
Then you are neither of your parents!|It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
Then you are neither of your parents!|But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
Then you are neither of your parents!|I want to. I love her so much, but I’m afr…It’s too huge.
Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?|Well yeah, but then…
Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?|Depends on what you mean by we.
The nights are the hardest.  But then the day comes! And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…|The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I’m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I’m getting married today!
I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.|
Okay. But wait!|What?!
Let’s go to lunch.|I can’t go to lunch!!
Oh good God! I’ve fallen down!|What’s going on?
Okay. All right.  Honey listen. When I tell you what I’m about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.|Okay, you’re-you’re really freaking me out.
We can’t find Chandler…—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest.|How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
We can’t find Chandler…—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest.|Found the vest! I mean we’re gonna have to keep an eye on it, y’know make sure we don’t lose it again…
Oh!|Oh wow! Okay. Don’t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!|That can be arranged.
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!|Let’s reset.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!|Let’s take it from there.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!|Are you a little off today? It’s going terribly slowly.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I’m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?|Of course! I’m-I’m sorry. I-I’d hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Thank you. Thank you.|Still rolling, annnnd action!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!|Now, that can be arranged!  Slippery little bugger!
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?|Here comes the bride.
Oh my God Monica!|I wanna wear this everyday.
Oh my God Monica!|You look so beautiful.
Oh my God Monica!|I’m so happy for me.
Oh my God Monica!|Hello?
Oh my God Monica!|Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
Oh my God Monica!|Yeah, we got him back. Everything’s fine.
Oh my God Monica!|Damnit!
Oh my God Monica!|What? Why? Where are you?
Oh my God Monica!|I’m still on the set!
Oh my God Monica!|Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
Oh my God Monica!|I know! I’m sorry! The guy’s drunk, they won’t let me go until we get this.
Oh my God Monica!|Oh my God! I’m gonna have to find another minister.
Oh my God Monica!|No! No, I’m the minister! All right, look-look, put ‘em both on the phone, I’ll marry them right now.
Oh my God Monica!|Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
Oh my God Monica!|Hey! Don’t you hang up on me! I’ll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary, was it?|No.
I’m telling you, just a little bit at a time.|Yeah okay. Well, what’s the next little bit?
Getting married.  Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you’ve done everything else!|Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.
Yeah.|Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!|Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Okay.|Okay.
Okay.|Oh fresh air!
Okay.|Wait! Maybe, maybe you’re overreacting! You do that y’know.
Okay.|Well Phoebe, we gotta do something!  Well, y’know. I mean there’s no way Joey’s gonna make it in time. So I’m gonna through the hotel and see if there’s any other weddings going on.
Okay.|Okay. Oh but don’t tell them Monica’s pregnant because, they frown on that.
Okay.|Okay.
Okay.|Okay.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It’s a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?|I don’t know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?|I thought he was with you.
He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.|You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.
You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.|Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.
You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.|As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.|But that was after the wedding, it’s not bad luck then.
You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.|Honey, it isn’t good luck.
Oh my God! Monica!|I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.|Are you okay?
Uh-huh.|Well, you’re-you’re sweating.
These-these are beads of joy.|Oh that’s sweet. Don’t touch me.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?|Yeah!
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?|What’s going on?
Chandler’s gone again!|Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!|I’m sorry Joey, as long as he’s here and he’s conscious we’re still shooting.
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!|You wouldn’t happen to have a very big fork?
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That’s it, we’re done for the day.|Well have we finished the scene?
Yeah! You…you were wonderful.|As were you.
So I got your car, it’s right outside.|Why? Are we done for the day?
That’s what you told me.|Oh, thank you. You’re welcome.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.|Is that my ass?
There he is!!|What?
There he is!!|Hey! Oh!
You’re not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!|Ross!
Hiiii-Ya!!  I’m serious! You’re not walking out on my sister!|That’s right! I’m not!
Then where the hell have you been?!|I know about Monica.
Then where the hell have you been?!|You know?!
What?|Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
What?! What?! Talking about what?!|You don’t know?
Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right now…|What? You’ll hi-ya?
Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right now…|Monica’s pregnant.
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?|Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes…
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?|Cigarettes?!!
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?|Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that’s when I uh, saw this.  Yeah, y’know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can’t be scary.
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?|Well you obviously didn’t see Chucky 3.
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?|But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she’d know I was okay.
Dude.|Way to go son! I knew you’d find him!

Our little boy is getting married.|As are you…
Our little boy is getting married.|Let us begin. Dearly beloved…
Our little boy is getting married.|We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I’ve known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I’ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
Our little boy is getting married.|He took off?
Our little boy is getting married.|Go on! Go on.
Our little boy is getting married.|Chandler, for so long I…I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I’d ever been looking for my whole life. And now…here we are…with our future before us…and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don’t want to. You go!
Our little boy is getting married.|Chandler?
Our little boy is getting married.|
Our little boy is getting married.|You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
Our little boy is getting married.|I do.
Our little boy is getting married.|I do.
Our little boy is getting married.|Yeah you do!

Our little boy is getting married.|I didn’t take a pregnancy test.
Our little boy is getting married.|Then…who did?
Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.|Uh-huh.
The Stuff You’ve Never Seen|Conan O’Brien
The Stuff You’ve Never Seen|This is stuff we never saw from all of the seasons, so for all of the scene settings I will be using the current arrangements. Even though some of the out takes take place when Chandler was living with Joey and Rachel was living with Monica, when Joey and Chandler were living in Monica and Rachel’s, and the current arrangements.
It’s a tradition here on Friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys,  talk down the episode umm… The point of this whole thing is what people see in America is: they see Friends, they love the show, it looks like a smooth running machine, but behind the scenes there’s deceit, mistrust, and hate. And I thought, I thought we’d actually take a look at uh, y’know some of these moments where you guys are—there are mistakes. You make mistakes.|Once and a while.

And I thought, I thought we’d actually take a look at uh, y’know some of these moments where you guys are—there are mistakes. You make mistakes.|From time to time.
For example, I don’t have to memorize lines. You guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?|Our energy just comes way up when there’s an audience here and when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesn’t, it just doesn’t work.
Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn’t. I did.|Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh.
Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I don’t know what to do!|It is one of those days!
‘Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay—[Beep]—uck it!|Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?
You still get nervous everybody just before a show?|Absolutely.
You still get nervous everybody just before a show?|Everybody.
You still get nervous everybody just before a show?|It’s amazing like all week long we’ve-we’ve been saying the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once, then you’ll get nervous because you’ll—you know you’ll probably mess up again.
Action!|When you were little you slept through-through the Grand Canyon.
Watch again that hand.|This’ll be five/ten takes.
Okay.|Okay. You know it’s gonna happen.
Once again, and action!|
Once again, and action!|Oh! Okay! I’m gonna try it without the coffee cup ‘cause I think it’s the left hand that’s messing me up.
Sorry, let’s go back! ‘Cause you’ve got more to say.|Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that’s your fault. I…say.
Sorry, let’s go back! ‘Cause you’ve got more to say.|I love you.
Sorry, let’s go back! ‘Cause you’ve got more to say.|I love you!
Hey and, this is a little extra something for y’know, always being there for me.|Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!
Hey and, this is a little extra something for y’know, always being there for me.|What?!
Ahh! Sh——it that hurt!|Are you okay?
It was so wild! We told ‘em we were the Gunderson’s in 16…|I spit on her!
Operation. You had a fun one.|Oh yeah!
With Operation.|It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer.
But le Blanc really doesn’t mess up much.|You don’t verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up.
But le Blanc really doesn’t mess up much.|I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call ‘em.
He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And he——he was afraid he was gonna fall down…|You could actually see him trying not to fall down.
Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out!|Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!
Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something’s naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?|I don’t necessarily like to juice things…
Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something’s naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?|He said true or false!
Oh! Ooh-ooh!|What are you doing?!
You’re still a tiny bit on fire there.|Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!
It was great seeing you the other night.|Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.|What the fu——ck are you doing?!
Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with a monkey…|That damn monkey.
Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That’s Dr. Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There—|Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here—Katie!  Very good.
No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!|Well at Monica’s you can eat—
No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!|Okay, shh yeah. ‘Cause it’s not silly.
No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!|Here we go.
No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!|Okay.
No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!|And…action!
Ready?|Yeah.
And then it just builds on itself and there’s no doing the scene after. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it.|For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when—I mean when…
You bastard.|Yeah, what did I do?
You bastard.|…I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to you, or a certain take, I-I—I mean I find it so funny.
Mornin’|Mornin’
I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can’t even say, "Hmm, noodle soup?"|That’s a good one?
I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can’t even say, "Hmm, noodle soup?"|Now, we should go back and take the other line.
I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can’t even say, "Hmm, noodle soup?"|Okay, I’ll just put a little more booze on there.
I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can’t even say, "Hmm, noodle soup?"|I think, subconsciously…
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross.|No! No! No!
I’m doing my brother.|That’s…gross.
You uh, you’ve worked with—They always say a performer should never work with pets or children.|Aww, the kids.
Action.|Okay. Now—What is my first line?
Action.|What did we agree?
Action.|Okay…
The good thing about the young kids though, they’re completely unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one story…|Oh little Ben.
Hi! We’re visiting!|Yay!
It’s Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y’know, you might as well say it because I told your…|Da…Da.
Can you say Da-Da? See, I’m gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try…|Da…Da.
Huh?|Da…Da.
Huh?|Yeah, he’s saying Da-Da.
And then sometimes during the show y’know but you’re like, the scene’s going one way but you’re just tempted to say something another time. Like, do you remember that one where Monica’s baking cookies in our old apartment?|She’s trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.
What do I smell?|
What do I smell?|Le Blanc.
What do I smell?|I don’t know, but it smells good.
What are you guys doing?|Nothing.
What are you guys doing?|Nothin’.
So that you will intentionally do something that—they’ll-they’ll intentionally screw it up?|Yeah!
So that you will intentionally do something that—they’ll-they’ll intentionally screw it up?|Yeah!
That tastes like feet!|It tastes like  feet!
That tastes like feet!|Okay, we’re good.
That tastes like feet!|Action!
Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and you’ll—we’ll be rehearsing during the week and you just—whatever-whatever the joke is; it’s so funny we can’t get through it in rehearsal and just…|You just know.
Are you saying that you don’t want to get with this?|You see, I don’t say—
Whoa! She’s purty!|Oh yeah, and she’s really nice too! She taught me about y’know, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.
Whoa! She’s purty!|Joey?
Whoa! She’s purty!|I’m sorry…
Whoa! She’s purty!|Excuse me, what?
When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be; there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a scene.|Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a stair—a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably…I-I think it was the hardest I’ve-I’ve laughed in my life period.
Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!|Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!|Pivat!!  Pivat!!!
You’ve done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80 years from now you’ll be thinking about?|It is when we’re able to crack each other up.

Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.|I can’t! I-I don’t have any other clothes here.
Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.|Find some! Please! Anything that doesn’t say I-I died tragically in France.
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|Okay.  Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|Because I’m not.

Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|What?! What are you talking about?
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|What are you talking about?
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|Yes, I…I am with child.  And I didn’t want to say anything because it’s your day; I didn’t want to steal your thunder.
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?!  Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|Who’s the father?
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|Yeah!
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|I can’t say.

Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|Okay, okay. It’s James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|As in Barbara Streisand’s husband James Brolin?
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|What?! Well he never said that to me!
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|How about just the bridemaids?
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|Y’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|It is.
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|For you.
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|Oh my God!
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can’t deal with this just quite yet.
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|You said that she was, I just didn’t disagree with you.
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|Sneaky.

Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people.|What size shoes do you wear?
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.|Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry.|Those aren’t eleven and a half.

How?|I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.
Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.|Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave.
Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.|Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.
Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?|I don’t know.
Are you okay?|Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Are you okay?|Champagne?

Why bother?|How do you feel?
Why bother?|I don’t know. I don’t know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don’t want to make.  Somebody just take this away from me!!
Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.|What?!
When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.|Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.|How many ways are there to do that?
I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.|All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.

Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.|No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor.

So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?|Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show…|Look umm Joey, I-I don’t think you’re quite right for this project.
Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me.|It’s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
Well I’m not proud of this, but…|Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don’t-don’t-don’t!
Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?|Did it turn into sand?
Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine.|No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me.  There you go.|Chandler, I’m gonna have you arrested.
Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me.  There you go.|Why?
Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me.  There you go.|You stole my moves.

Are you sure?|Well yeah, I lied before.
Oh!|Oh God…
Oh!|Now you know how you really feel about it.
Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game!|Are you really gonna do this?
Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby!|With who?
I just didn’t see the fast song coming.|Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay.
Oh, thank you.|That is so sweet!

Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?|No!  even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.|A tiny salt shaker!!!
Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!|Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Oh yeah.|Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
Okay.|Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one.|Or this one!
Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one.|Hi.
Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one.|Hey, how are you feelin’? Any morning sickness?
Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one.|Shh-shh-shh! The guys don’t know yet do they?
Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one.|No! Joey and Ross don’t know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebe’s pregnant.
Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.  After you of course.|Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.
Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?|Ew! No!
What?! I think he’s cute.|Well then you have his baby.
Believe me I’m trying.|Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.
Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.|Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.|Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything.
Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!|What was that bam?
I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.|Hey!
I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.|Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?
I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.|I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!
I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.|Oh Joey! Joey! No, it’s not you! You didn’t get anybody pregnant!
I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.|Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on?  Is somebody pregnant?
Oh yeah. That’s me.|Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?
Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby!|Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?
You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.|Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
David Lynn.|David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
David Lynn.|Who’s David Lynn?
Chandler?|Hey! Did you find the cameras?
No. Did you?|Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.
Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them.|Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?|All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!
I’m sorry man.  Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.|Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.|Are you serious?
I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?|Marriage advice? Really?!
I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?|I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.
What about the chairs?|She picked those out too.
How about the place settings?|That was her.
What did you do?|I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?|Not yet.
Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it?  Is it Gunther?|No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther.
Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby…|Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now!
Why not?|I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!
Bus?|No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
Well-well but it is huge.|I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?|No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Okay.|Give me one more.
Okay.|Hey.
Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.|All right.
Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so…  Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?|Oh my God! Joey!
Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so…  Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?|Hell yeah! I’ll marry you!
Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so…  Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?|You can’t marry him!
Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so…  Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?|Hey lady, your day’s over! It’s my turn!
Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so…  Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?|Phoebe!
Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!|I can and I will!
Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!|She’s not pregnant. It’s Rachel. Rachel’s the one who’s pregnant.
Oh my God.|Hey!
Oh my God.|Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn’t have a baby in nine months!
Oh my God.|It’s Joey!
Who’s the father?|We don’t know.
Ohh… I wonder if that dude.|There’s a dude?
Yeah.|Who? Who is it?
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but…|Was that story over?
The guy left this.|
The guy left this.|People have got to finish their stories!
Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?|Oh! Of course.
Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?|Uh, would you take one of us?
Uhh… Yeah sure.  Click!|It didn’t click.
Uhh… Yeah sure.  Click!|I heard it. I heard it.
Uhh… Yeah sure.  Click!|But there was no flash.
Uhh… Yeah sure.  Click!|Why won’t you take our picture?
Oh yeah. I’ll take, I’ll take your picture.|Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!|What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit.  I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.|Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?|Uh, let’s rip!
Really? Are you sure?|Oh Phoebe!
Okay, sorry. Yeah.|Hey Rach.
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|Okay. Okay!
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|That’s my car!
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|A ’95 LeSabre?!
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|Yes!
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|A green LeSabre?
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|Yes!
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|I’m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|Yes! Green-blue!
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|Well go! Go move it!
Okay, you ready for the last picture?|Yeah.
So, what’s this about?|Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
No.  This is my red sweater.|Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
What’s going on Rach?|Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
Y’know, I’m actually glad Phoebe called.  I know we broke up because you thought I wasn’t mature enough, but I’ve really grown up and think we should get back together.|Oh, it’s just not the right time.
It is the right time.|Okay.
I’m ready for more.|Tag…
Come on Rach, let’s give it another try.|I’m having a baby.
Oh.|You can go.
I don’t know how any of these got opened?!|You opened them all?
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!|Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift!
Yeah. What is that?|Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.
Hey! How’d it go?|Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
Hey! How’d it go?|Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?
Hey! How’d it go?|I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you.
Hey! How’d it go?|Oh wow, you didn’t even try to unhook my bra!
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?|No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?|Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you’re not gonna be alone in this.
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?|I’m not?
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?|Listen I uh…  Rachel Green will you marry me?
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?|What?
What?!|What?!!
What?!|Pheebs, give me the ring back!
What?!|No!!
What?!|No! Joey, oh you’re so sweet. You’re so-so sweet, honey. But I’m not, I’m not looking for a husband.
What?!|I understand.
What?!|Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down.
What?!|I can’t say that didn’t hurt. But I’ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.
What?!|Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered…
What?!|Ooh! A Salami Buddy!
What?!|There you go!
What?!|We’re back!
Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen!  Let’s stay in the kitchen!|It’s picture time.

Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen!  Let’s stay in the kitchen!|Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.
Wow! That is a great picture!|Eh?
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!|Huh, didn’t see that coming.
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!|Okay, so this isn’t a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss with…with this lady. Which by the look on your face I’m sure you’ll remember. So we don’t need——There’s no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.
That would be a good idea.|Okay.  You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
You kissed another woman!|Call it even?!
Okay!|Well, I’m gonna go get these  in some water.
Okay!|Wait you stole those from these people’s wedding?
Okay!|No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming.  Hey! My sweater! I’ve been looking for this for like a month!
Okay!|Oh my God!!
Okay!|Oh my God!
Hey! How you doing?|Good! Good, long time no see.

A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|How?! How do you know?
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|It was his sweater, but—Oh my God!
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I’m so relieved you guys know.
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|This is so great! And I’m gonna be your baby’s aunt!
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|I know!
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Me too!
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|I’m gonna be an uncle! Come here!
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|You’re all gonna be aunts and uncles.
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Yeah, but I’m the only one related by blood.
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some advice on how I’m gonna tell Ross!
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Well, what were you gonna say?
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Well I was gonna tell him that I’m-I’m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Well that, that sounds good.
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what’s-what’s the first thing that I say?
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Hey! Good luck!
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Yeah, bye.
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Bye.
Hey, what was that all about?|Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
Why am I talking like this?!|I didn’t think you could keep it a secret.
I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.|What secrets?
Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.|You’ll tell me later?
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.|Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.|I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you.
What?! They took mine to give to you!|Why would they take away our keys?
Maybe they don’t trust us.|No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?|Hey, I washed those!
No you didn’t.|Yeah that didn’t sound like me.
Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!|Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
What stuff?|Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it.
What stuff?|Hey!
Did Rachel find you?|No why?
Oh she was looking for you.|Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later.
Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.|Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.|Oh no.
What?|I think I might know what this is about.
What?|Really?
What?|Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren’t gonna tell anybody this but uh, about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.
And?|Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Oh sorry.  And?!|Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
Oh sorry.  And?!|Yeah, I don’t think that’s what it is.
Oh sorry.  And?!|Why? What-what else could it be?
Oh sorry.  And?!|Oh wow, I don’t feel well.
Oh sorry.  And?!|I’m telling you. I’m telling you. That’s what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn’t say anything to you?
Maybe it’s something you ate?|Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
Maybe it’s something you ate?|Yeah, I guess I should.
Next?|They’re kissing let’s just go around them.
Next?|Oh honey, leave them alone, they’re in love.
Next?|I’m in love too! But in an orderly fashion.
Next?|Hi! Can you do that and walk? ‘Cause she said, "Next."
Next?|Sorry. We didn’t hear you; we’re on our honeymoon.
Oh, let me see what I can do.  There are some first class seats available.|Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon.
Oh, let me see what I can do.  There are some first class seats available.|We are on our honeymoon.
Oh, let me see what I can do.  There are some first class seats available.|Grab my ass!
Next?|Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon.
Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you’ll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you’ll be in 25K.|Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
I’m sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.|You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!
I’m sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.|25J and K, any chance those aren’t together?
I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.|Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?|You said there was a gas leak in here.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?|Well why don’t you use your key?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?|Because by the time I find it on this thing  Come on! Hurry up.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?|Oh! We could have done that.
Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?|No.
Me neither! We have to get in!|Just act like you belong.
Oh my God! Oranges!|Shh!
Oh my God! Oranges!|Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?
Oh my God! Oranges!|Yes, of course.
Oh my God! Oranges!|I’m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can’t see the seat number.
Oh my God! Oranges!|Oh that’s all right, I have it memorized. It’s 1A.
Oh my God! Oranges!|Sir, this is not a first class ticket. I’m sorry.
Oh my God! Oranges!|Apology accepted. Excuse us.
Oh my God! Oranges!|Sir! I’m afraid I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.
Hi!|Hi.
Hi.  Umm, I think there’s something that we really need to talk about.|Look uh, I know why you’re here.
You do?|Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
Okay.|Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?
What?|I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?
Seriously. What?!|Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?|Oh sure.
Can I get you some water?|I’m good. I’m good.
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.|Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.|What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
They do!|No they don’t!!!  Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.|Oh well I may as well have!
Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…|Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!
Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later.|No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact,  I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Okay, y’know maybe I should come back…|Shh! Shh! Shh!
Okay.|
I’ve looked everywhere. There’s no gas leak.|
Anyway uh, I’ll get moving on that new door.|Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
Well I’m gonna have to put on a new lock, they’ll find out anyway.|Oh no.
Hey Ross!|Hi.
Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?|Sure.
Namaste.|Namaste.
Namaste.|Oh my God! What happened to the door?!
Namaste.|So it’s noticeable huh?
Namaste.|Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
Namaste.|Didn’t you two already talk?
Namaste.|Yeah but uh… Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there’s something else.  Rachel’s pregnant.
Namaste.|Oh my God!!! I can’t believe that!!
Namaste.|Holy mother of God!!!
Namaste.|With my child.
Namaste.|That is brand new information!!
Namaste.|You already know don’t you?
Namaste.|A little bit.
Namaste.|How are you doing?
Namaste.|Okay. Okay. I mean I’ll be okay. It’s just I don’t think I handled it very well.
Namaste.|Well, what did you say to her?
Namaste.|Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.
Namaste.|Oh Ross.
Namaste.|But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.
Namaste.|What?
Namaste.|I gotta go find her.
Namaste.|Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don’t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!
Namaste.|Evidently they do.
Namaste.|What?!
I can’t believe we’re here.|Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.
What?|As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
No!! You have been screwing us all day!|Who are you?
No!! You have been screwing us all day!|We’re you just ten seconds later!
Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!|Well you can have the suite if you want. We don’t care about where we stay. We’re here to celebrate our love together. We don’t have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!|We need the stuff.
Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.|What? Are you serious?!  Joey smells gas!
Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.|What else is new?
Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys.|Well do something! Get in there!
How? I guess I could break down your door.|Yeah! Do that!
And-and you won’t blame us for any damage?|No!  Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!
Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down.|Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door.
Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?|If I said I was, would you judge me?
The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.|Okay.  Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn…
The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.|Hi!
The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.|Hi!
The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.|Uh we-we need to talk.

Hi!|Hey!
Hi!|Hello!
Welcome home.|So, how was the honeymoon?
Welcome home.|It was great! It was great! How about you?! I mean you’re having a baby!
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!|Oh great!
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!|Ross! It’s got your wavy black lines!
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!|All right, so now that Ross knows can you tell us y’know how it happened? I mean, when did it happen? How many times did it happen?
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!|Monica! That’s not right! Start with where.
Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.|You’re welcome buddy.
Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.|
And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.|Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.
What is?|The lie you just told.
That-that you came on to me?|There’s the one!
But you did! I mean, let’s be honest.|Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who.
But you did! I mean, let’s be honest.|Whom.  That’s right.
You know you kissed me first.|What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
I was sending you signals?|Yeah!
Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands.|Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?|Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
No please, show me how I begged you!|I can show you, I have it on videotape!  It’s an expression.
I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!|Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!|Y’know who has a great video camera?
Greg and Jenny?|Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.
Greg and Jenny?|Let’s call ‘em.
Greg and Jenny?|Yeah! Ask them if they brought their friends any souvenirs!
Greg and Jenny?|Eighth street deli?
Greg and Jenny?|Hey, hang up! You get food poisoning just talkin’ to that place.
Greg and Jenny?|
Greg and Jenny?|Here you go.
Greg and Jenny?|It’s the deli again!
Greg and Jenny?|All right! I’ll have a sandwich!
Greg and Jenny?|I don’t think this number’s right!
Greg and Jenny?|What?
You got fake numbered.|What?! People don’t do that!
You got fake numbered.|Oh I think we do.
You got fake numbered.|They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?
You got fake numbered.|I don’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.
You got fake numbered.|And you’ve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!
You got fake numbered.|Y’know what? Don’t worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.
Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects.|Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door!
Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!|Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!|Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!|Personal thing? What personal thing? I don’t know.
That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!|About…about sex?  That I hadn’t had sex in months?
That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!|Yeah I knew what you were talkin’ about.
Hey!|Hey.
Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about.|Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.|Whoa, for like months?
Five to be lying, six.|Six months? Whoa that’s rough.
Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.|The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health!|Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty.
Really? Well then tell it to me.|Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
I’ll try to control myself.|Okay.  Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe…
You were backpacking across Western Europe?|Have a nice six more months Ross!
Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?|I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around.  And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying…
Umm, this is great wine.|It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Really?|Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.|Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…
I love hiking!|Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo…
I think its Tibidabo.|Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?|Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it.|No! No, I don’t…don’t want to.
How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?|I was backpacking across Western Europe.
I’m not feeling it.|I was just outside Barcelona, hiking…
No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?|It’s been six months! I’m always hot!
Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong.|I’ll try that.
All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right?|Thanks.
Good luck.|Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Yeah?|Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.
|Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?  Rachel!
|Oh Ross!
|Hi!
|Thank God you’re here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?
|That’s less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.
|So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.
|Yeah, we’re gonna need to see that tape.
|Yeah, definitely.
|What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!
Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape!|Thank you.  No!
You’re right.|Joey! No!
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.|Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names.|Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names.|Regina Philange.
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names.|I still don’t get it, we didn’t do anything wrong.
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.|I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
|Well maybe it was all of your questions.
What about my questions?|The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?|Was that another question?
Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?|Hey! Is Ross still here?
Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?|Uh no Rach, he’s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.
Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?|Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it?  Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.
Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?|Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didn’t even watch it! Anyway, here.
Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?|Thank you.  You don’t want to see this do you?
Hell yeah!!!|I am not gonna show you this!
Hell yeah!!!|No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.
Hell yeah!!!|Forget it, she’s destroying it.
Hell yeah!!!|Okay fine! Fine! We’ll just have to think of some other way to put the whole ‘Who came onto who,’ thing to rest! Come on now, think!!
Hell yeah!!!|Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? It’s Rachel’s tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.
Hell yeah!!!|I wanna see it.
Hell yeah!!!|What?!
Hell yeah!!!|Clearly you don’t want people to see this tape. Now I don’t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don’t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?
Hell yeah!!!|Are we watchin’ the tape or not?!
Hell yeah!!!|I don’t want people to see it for your sake.
Hell yeah!!!|Ahh, I don’t believe you. I think you don’t want them to see you begging me.
Hell yeah!!!|Rachel, please…
Hell yeah!!!|Ah, a little preview!
Hell yeah!!!|Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes I’m gonna be saying…
Hell yeah!!!|Okay, here we go.
Hell yeah!!!|Hello! Can I get you anything?
Hell yeah!!!|I’m so happy!
There I am.|You’re gonna get pregnant.
I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I…|You didn’t do it?
I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.|Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine.
Kinda hurtin’ my hand though.|I know.
Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh…|Did you do it on our invitations?!
Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh…|Not on the ones we sent out.
Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh…|So, just the ones gave back to us and we had framed!
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.|I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost…
Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it?|I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to.
Oh I wanted to.|So we…we both wanted to.
Interesting.|Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me.|And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.
Okay, get ready to see some beggin’!|Oh, you came on to Ross!
What?!|Now I’m so happy.
What are you talking about?!|You used the Europe story!
What are you talking about?!|That’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
How do you know about that story?!|How do you know about that story?!
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!|
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.|Ken Adams!!
Hi.|So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.|It was an amazing night.
It was. It was an amazing night.|You think it looked amazing?
I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it.|Yeah, me neither. Yet…
Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.|Yeah, it would be really weird.
Good luck.|Good luck to you.
Mind if I mute?|Oh please.
Oh, oh there go the clothes.|You are undressing very quickly.
Six months Rachel, six months.|Ah.  Oh.
Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good.|That’s what I was gonna say.

Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?|Yeah.
Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?|Oh you…you made pesto?
Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?|Yes I did.
Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?|Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?|I…I-I don’t know, but I would say it’s pretty good-o.
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.|I like your necklace.
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.|I made it myself.
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.|You are so talented.
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.|Well, it’s no pesto.
Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.|You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
You’re a joker Bing.|What’s funny about that?
You’re a joker Bing.|Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
You’re a joker Bing.|Hey that’s okay. So, where do you want to go?
You’re a joker Bing.|Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
You’re a joker Bing.|The Hard Rock Caf�?
You’re a joker Bing.|Yeah!
You’re a joker Bing.|Again?!
You’re a joker Bing.|Yeah!!
You’re a joker Bing.|I’m telling you, I like the food!
You’re a joker Bing.|You like the Purple Rain display!  Hey Bob.
You’re a joker Bing.|Hey Toby! Have a good night.
You’re a joker Bing.|Did that guy just call you Toby?
You’re a joker Bing.|Yeah, he thinks that’s my name.
You’re a joker Bing.|Well, why don’t you correct him?
You’re a joker Bing.|Oh it’s been going on way to long now. Y’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn’t say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it’s five years later, the donut’s gone and I’m still Toby.
You’re a joker Bing.|Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
You’re a joker Bing.|No! That would be so awkward! Look—Besides, we work in different departments. He’s on the sixth floor y’know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What’s the big deal? It could be worse, it’s not like he’s calling me Muriel.
You’re a joker Bing.|Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It’s not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
You’re a joker Bing.|Shh! It is a family name!
You’re a joker Bing.|Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
Drake, I’ve discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.|What is it?
Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica’s brain.|Is it serious?
Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.|Well that sounds simple enough, let’s just do that.
We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone.|Cut! Very nice people!
We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone.|Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone.|Well don’t—What happened to Jessica’s body?!
We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone.|I’m not telling, you’ll have to see it on TV!
We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone.|You don’t know do you?
We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone.|No, couldn’t care less.
Hey good scene man.|Hey you too!
Alright.|What? You weren’t in it.
Alright.|Oh!
Alright.|Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
Alright.|Yes?
Alright.|This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
Alright.|Hi.
Alright.|Hey! How come I haven’t seen you here before?
Alright.|Well, Joey probably thinks I’ll just embarrass him. Y’know, he thinks I’m some kind of a soap opera nut—Which I’m not! I’m not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.  And uh, and that your-your dog’s name is Wally. Well look at that, I’m just stroking your arm.
Alright.|
Alright.|Oh, we’re leaving. Bye Kash.
Alright.|Bye.
Alright.|Say hi to Wally.
Ooh Monica!|Hi!
Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him.|I…I have to fire him.
But why?!|Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.|Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?|All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.|I paid to have this done.
Hey!|Hi!
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.|I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him.|Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
I said no.|What?!
What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.|Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.|Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?
Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…|Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!
Hey Bob.|Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today?
If I see him, I’ll ask.|Toby!
If I see him, I’ll ask.|Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
Yeah!|Oh then you know each other.
We’re on a semi-first name basis.|What do you think of adding him to our team?
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.|Really? They love him down on six.
But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.|Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
I think it’s best sir.|But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.|
Hey!|Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
But…|No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.|Why not?!
Because I’m dumping him today.|What?! You said he was sweet!
He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time.  "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"|Just don’t pick up your phone.
Then he comes over!  "I’m so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!|What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?
You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.|Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!|Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!
Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.|What do you mean?
Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!|I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
Hey Toby, you got a sec?|Sure, what’s up?
Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?"|Hey!
Hi!|Hey!
Hi!|So, what do you want to do tonight? There’s a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that’s supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
Hi!|No. No. But I’ll go see a normal person movie with ya.
Hi!|Rach? You wanna come?
Oh no, I can’t. I got a date.|A date?
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?|Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?|It’s no Ukrainian film.
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|I set her up with this actor on my show.
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|You set her up?!
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|No
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Joey what-what were you thinking?!
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Well, I was thinking that it’d probably be okay because Ross hasn’t gone out with Rachel in five years!
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Joey, I’m not worried about her! I’m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Hey! I’m an  actor too! I’m not sure. I think they’re taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Why don’t they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that’s a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That’s fun too! Whew!!
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Hey Joey.
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Hey.
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Hi. I-I hear you’re going on a ferry tonight.
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|Yeah.
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|A bit of a daredevil are we?
Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash!|Hey Rachel! You ready to go?
Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later.|Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Thank you.|Thank you.
Thank you.|Yes it is too slutty!
|Hi.
Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me calling you. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?|It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy.
It’s because I’m with you.|Aw.  I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…
Whoops. Sorry.|Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.
So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.|Books?
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!|Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?|Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.
Dude! What is going on?!|I just…I have to find out how it went.
Why?|This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!|I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?|I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.
What do you mean?|It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.
That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!|No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?|It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.|No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.|No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.
That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?|Yeah.
Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!|We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Hey Toby!|Hey Bobby.
It’s Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing’s office is?|Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.|Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.
Toby don’t.|Bob!
Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!|Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Hey.|I got your page, is everything okay?
Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?|Oh it’s great! It’s great! Thank you so much for introducing us!

Hey.|My mother killed herself.
Hey.|She, now I knew that and…now I’m sweating. Look at me, I’m really sweating—Now I’m saying, "Look at me," I’m getting even sweatier. I think I probably should go.
Hey.|No-no! That’s okay, we’ll just start over. Okay? Hi! I’m Phoebe.
Hey.|Eric.
Hey.|Why are you looking at me like that?
Hey.|‘Cause the sweat’s getting in my eyes and its burning.
Hey.|Okay.  So, what are you?
Hey.|I don’t think they have a name for it. It’s just I get nervous; I start sweating like crazy.
Hey.|No I-I meant your costume.
Hey.|Oh umm, I’m the solar system.  Yeah, my students helped me make it—I teach the second grade.
Hey.|I love the second grade!
Hey.|Really?
Hey.|Yeah! It’s so much better than first grade when you don’t know what’s going on and definitely better than third grade. Y’know with all the politics and mind games.
Hey.|So what do you do?
Hey.|Umm, I’m a masseuse…by day.
Hey.|Y’know you don’t have to stand here with me, believe me…
Hey.|No I’m having fun. I’m really—And I’m really-really excited for you and Ursula.
Hey.|Oh I feel very lucky, she’s great. I think she’s the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen.
Hey.|Thank you.
Hey Joey?|Yeah.
You read comic books right?|Exclusively.
Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?|Catwoman, hands down.
Yeah…|But between you and Phoebe, I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe.
What?! Really?!|Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she?
No you’re fine.  All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?|I’m not sure.
What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here!  As hard as you can!|Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn’t matter.
Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?|I would say, "Woman, please!"
Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?|Hey. Ursula’s fianc�e is really sweet! He’s a teacher, he does all this volunteer work. Y’know normally y’know, I don’t like really sweaty guys. But this one? I could just mop him up!

Hey beautiful.|Hello handsome.  Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Two weeks ago.|Two weeks? That’s it?
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and it’s not like me to do something so impulsive, but she’s just so perfect, and we have so much in common.|Oh really?
We’re both teachers.|Huh?
And we were both in the Peace Corps.|Peace Corps, really?
In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.|Yeah. It wasn’t a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left.  Shall we get me really drunk?
Howdy doody.|That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed.|Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
What question?|Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
There’s no question.|So you think Ross too?
You picked Ross?!|Ross is really strong! Okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of you!  Except for Joey.
I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.|Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it?|Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!
Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it?|Wait-wait!! Okay, stop it! Stop it! Stop!  Now listen, no one’s gonna fight in this apartment.
Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it?|Hey Monica!  People came to see a fight, let’s give ‘em what they came for!
Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it?|Hey, you guys could arm wrestle.
Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it?|Yeah. Listen to the slutty nurse.
You’re going down.|Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!
You’re going down.|Seriously guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.
Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.|Really?
Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.|Trick or treat!
Gotta go!|My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy.|I’d rather have the money.
Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!|This isn’t fair.
Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?|Shut up!
You shut up!|You can’t tell me to shut up!
Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!|Rach?
Now wait a minute, I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up!|You’re a mean old woman.
Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!|That means nothing to me.  Come on!
Hi liar!|Hey!
Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.|Well they could be true.
But they’re not!|Yeah, it’s a fine line huh?
Why are you lying to him?|I don’t know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.
Why are you lying to him?|Honey?
Why are you lying to him?|It’s a filthy, disgusting habit and I want you to quit now!
Why are you lying to him?|She’s helped so many people to quit smoking.
Why are you lying to him?|Y’know, we’d really better get going.
Why are you lying to him?|Oh right, you’ve got a church group meeting tonight.

Wow! They’re both really strong.|God, I’m exhausted.
Wow! They’re both really strong.|Look this is starting to look really bad for me. Okay? Mona, Mona’s standing right over there.  Oh God, she’s talking to Joey! You gotta let me win!
Wow! They’re both really strong.|No way! If anything you’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks I’m a wimp!

Yay! My hero!|Hey. Ursula said she left her purse.
Yay! My hero!|Oh.
Yay! My hero!|What a relief. It has all the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.
Yay! My hero!|Sure it does. Yeah, yeah.
Yay! My hero!|Well, I guess I’ll see you at the wedding.
Yay! My hero!|Umm listen, I don’t think…I don’t think I’m gonna make it to the wedding. So I just want to wish you all the luck in the world.
Yay! My hero!|I think we’ll be okay. Besides it’s so perfect and  she’s been saving herself for me.
Yay! My hero!|Okay I can’t let you do this! She’s lying to you.
Yay! My hero!|What?
Yay! My hero!|She is lying! And I bet I can prove it. Excuse me.  Okay, here’s the nametag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress! Not a teacher, a waitress. All right, here’s her driver license, this oughta be good, she always lies about this. How old did she say she was?
Yay! My hero!|She told me she was 25.
Yay! My hero!|Oh, I almost don’t want to show this.  Just remember I’m a minute younger.
Yay! My hero!|I am so stupid. Of course she was lying! She’s not a teacher. There’s not such a thing as the top secret elementary school for the children of spies.
Yay! My hero!|No. You’re not, you’re not stupid.
Yay! My hero!|I’m not smart.  I just wanted so much to…be impulsive once. To be romantic.
Yay! My hero!|That’s good, you should be impulsive and you should be romantic. Just…you did it with the wrong person.  What?
Yay! My hero!|It’s just so weird, two people look so much alike, and so different.
Yay! My hero!|Eric!! Let’s go!!
Yay! My hero!|I’d better go, deal…
Yay! My hero!|Yeah, you should.
Yay! My hero!|Hurry up I gotta pray!!
Hey!|Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
That’s not so bad.|No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!|Really? You think that’s all it is?
Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.|Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.
Is that a secret or a lie.|No, I let him win—Ross!
Is that a secret or a lie.|Yeah?
Is that a secret or a lie.|Would you tell her I let you win please?
Is that a secret or a lie.|Oh. Yeah.
Is that a secret or a lie.|I am strong! I’ll show you!
Chandler please!|Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
Let’s go big bunny!|Okay. 1…2…3—Go!  I’m gonna kill myself!
Hey.|Hey.
Oh my God! You cleaned!  Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!|Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?|No, it wasn’t you.
Well then who?|I got a maid. Yay!
I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…|Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…
Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!|Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
Did she really say that?|Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
Fine, I can do it.  Whew.|What’s the matter?
Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.|I think it’s coming from your bag.
Hello?|Hi, it’s Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula’s fianc�e.
Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?|Oh, I have a friend who’s a cop and he got it for me.
Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.|Uh listen, I just—I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
Oh you did?  He did it! He did it!|Wow! What did he do?
Shhh! I’m talking.|Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who…eats lunch.
Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.|Yeah uh…okay. I’m-I’m sorry. Bye.
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.|Uhh, I won’t take no for an answer.
Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.|Great! But wh-wh—How do you know where I live?
I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye.|Bye.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|So apparently I’m available for lunch.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|I can’t. I’m busy. I’m apartment hunting.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|You’re moving?
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Yeah, I can’t live with Joey once the baby comes. I don’t want my child’s first words to be,  "How you doin’?"
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|So does-does Joey know you’re moving?
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Well, I haven’t discussed it with him yet, but I know he’s gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|That’s not really porn.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Not so much.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Hey, y’know what and if you’re looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Well I don’t know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want.  With your permission.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Yeah that would really be great.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Yeah.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn’t. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Yeah. No. No you’re right.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Shall we?
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|Yeah.
Yes?|Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.
Yes?|And I’m Rachel, an admirer of the building.
Yes?|I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I’m so sorry for your loss.
She didn’t pass.|What?
My mother’s still alive.|Oh, thank God!
It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she’s a tough old bird.|Ahh.
Are you close with her?|Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in
You speak Dutch?|Y’know I would it’s just painful.
You speak Dutch?|So she’s really not dead.
No, she’s hanging in there.|Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where’d you get it?|Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.
Okay. Uhh, I’m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I’ll clean behind the refrigerator.|I love her.
I’ll be back in a minute.|Okay.
I’ll be back in a minute.|See? I told you.
I’ll be back in a minute.|She stole my jeans!
I’ll be back in a minute.|What?
I’ll be back in a minute.|I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
I’ll be back in a minute.|So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
I’ll be back in a minute.|Don’t you see? It’s the perfect crime!
I’ll be back in a minute.|She must’ve been planning this for years!
I’ll be back in a minute.|I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
I’ll be back in a minute.|Honey, isn’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
I’ll be back in a minute.|I guess.
I’ll be back in a minute.|So, shouldn’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go…snooping around her crotch?
I’ll be back in a minute.|Fine. I’m just glad I didn’t give her my secret ingredient.
I’ll be back in a minute.|Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
I’ll be back in a minute.|Yeah!
Hi!|Come in, I’m so glad you’re here.
Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.|Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
Oh.|Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just…I got so angry just looking at her……face.
Yeah.  Yeah.|I’m sorry. I just…when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
Maybe this is too weird.|No wait! There’s only a problem when I look at you.
No don’t tear out your eyes!!|I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
Oh, yeah try that.  So, is that better?|Not really. You…you’re blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You’re Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe…If I-if I just don’t look at you for a while.  See? It…it works. I’m not, I’m not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.|Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar?
Yeah, we’re done.|Ezel.
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?|Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
Really?!|No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Sweet!|All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.|To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.|Oh, you’re switching apartments?
It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.|But Rachel has an apartment.
Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.|She is?
Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?|I guess I didn’t really think about it.
Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!|Jij hebt seks met ezels.
Nice jeans!|Oh thanks! I like your top.
Oh.  You’re not gettin’ it.|What happened?!
Oh, I fell asleep.|I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.|All right.
Hello.|What’s going on?!
Hey!|Hey!
How was the game?|Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much.
Oh.|Ooh.  So umm, I was talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.|I was kinda hoping you’d stay.
Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.|No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big.
Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.|I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.
Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.|I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.
I know.|Y’know I blame Ross for this.
I do too a little bit.|I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.|Oh no, stay here we’ll keep doing this. I’ll pay you.
No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.|Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
Hi!|Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
How come?|Because I put my head between her legs.
To see her pants?|They’re my pants!
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?|No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?|Fine.  She’s wearing my bra!
Oh dear God!|My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.|Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!
Here’s another plan…No!|I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!
Why?|Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!
I fear a jury will see it the same way!|Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!
You see that?|Do you see this?
All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!|Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.
Hi. How is she?|It’s not looking good.
|That’s so sweet.  Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I’m sure it would mean a lot to her.
Oh I don’t know that it would.|Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
Hey!|Welcome back!
Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?|I don’t know, I’m still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
Why?|Uh, the sex.
What sex?|Our sex.
We didn’t have sex.|Well if I didn’t have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like…
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!|Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!|Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and…
You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!|Well I was just so excited to see you.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.|No-no it’s not! I don’t want to lose you! It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.
So I guess this is it.|Yeah.  Maybe it’s for the best. You smell just like her.
What are you doing?|I’m leaning. This is where I lean.
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.|Brenda a bee!
What?|Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
I think I know what’s going on here.|You do?
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it’s wrong. You’re married.|I totally understand.  Can I just see your bra?
Hi!|Where did you get those jeans?!
You gave them to me!|No I didn’t!
All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.|Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
What bra?|The pink one with the flowers?!
You mean the one that you’re wearing?|
You mean the one that you’re wearing?|Sounds about right.
What is this?|Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
You’re so sweet.|Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no confusion?
But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.|I’m loud!
It’s gonna be up all night!|I’m up all night!
It’s gonna poop!|Hello!
What about all the women you want to bring home?|Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
Joey, are you sure?|Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
I want me to stay too.|Ohh!
Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!|I know! I found it on the street.
Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.|Yeah.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?|I don’t know.
It’s moving.|Ew.
It’s still——It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!|Ooh! Ah! Okay!
Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care,  because you got the apartment. Yes!|Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.
Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care,  because you got the apartment. Yes!|Isn’t that great?
Ezels!!|David Schwimmer
Hey Pheebs?|Huh?
I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?|Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy.
Oh no, no, I’ll be there too.|Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.
No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.|Oh. Why not?
‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.|Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’
What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.|Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
Thank you.|Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.  Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
Thank you.|No you don’t!
No you don’t.|Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
No you don’t.|Her what?!!
No you don’t.|Your secret bachelorette party…
No you don’t.|You had a bachelorette party?!
No you don’t.|She untied his G-string with her teeth.  Somebody stop me!
No you don’t.|I thought we weren’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
No you don’t.|It’s a grand tradition!
No you don’t.|I’m sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.|This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.|You went home with the waitress.
Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.|Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.|I can’t believe you didn’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.|Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?|Oh, I-I don’t eat meat.
It’s chicken.|Yeah, I don’t eat that either.
I’ll never understand you lesbians.  So baby, tell me…what is new with you.|Well actually umm…
I’ll never understand you lesbians.  So baby, tell me…what is new with you.|Your ’74 Lafite sir.
’74?! I ordered the ’75! That’s a magnificent wine! The ’74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?!  Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you’re a waiter?|This is why I told the manager I wouldn’t wait on you tonight!
Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby!|In case you didn’t notice, that is a scary man.
Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby!|He’s right though, the ’74 is absolute piss.
Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby!|This was such a huge mistake. I can’t tell him Phoebe. I can’t, I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…
Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby!|Rachel!
Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby!|No it’s okay, this is what’s gonna happen. I’m gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby!|Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby!|Hey, that is the…baby’s problem.  Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.|Well… Umm, I got TiVo.
What’s TiVo?|It’s slang for pregnant.
What’s TiVo?|Phoebe!
Are you really pregnant?|Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
Who is the father? Oh no! Please don’t tell me it’s her!|No, it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross.  Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!
That’s true.|Yeah.
So when is the wedding?|Who?
The wedding! There’s going to be a wedding. Young lady, don’t you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard!  Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!|February 2nd!
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.|Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y’know take it all in.|Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
So, I gotta get going.|Okay, I-I’ll see you tonight.
Yeah.|Okay, bye.

Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you’re going down the same path, but you’re really going down different ones.
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|I’m gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you’re gonna have a bachelor party.

Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|Honey! That’s crazy! I don’t want you to get me a stripper…
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|Will you let the lady talk?!
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|Come on! Come on, it’ll be fun! It’ll make me feel so much better.
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it’s a little creepy. Y’know? I’m not a bachelor anymore.
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|So don’t think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a…a two month anniversary present.
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!

Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|I’m sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby…
I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.|I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong.
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|I just called a friend of mine.
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|Yeah?
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!!  Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|What is it sweetie?
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|There’s not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|What?!
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|I’m sorry daddy.
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|I don’t believe this!!
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won’t marry you?! That’s it! Is that it?!
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|Yes. Yes, he says I’m damaged goods.
So you uh, nervous about getting married?|What are you doing?
Look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay? Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on, it’ll be fun.|Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.
How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.|You’re right, this is more fun.
That’s her! Okay, come on!|Hi!
That’s her! Okay, come on!|Hi.
That’s her! Okay, come on!|So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!|That’s me.

Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.|Yeah, yeah right over there.
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.|All right, whenever you’re ready.
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.|That was weird.
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?|I’m waiting.
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?|So she’s a…

Oh wow! So, you’re more than just dinosaurs.|So much more.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I’m so sorry!|Aw forget it, it’s from Pier One.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I’m so sorry!|You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I’m gonna kill you!!
Oh my God! Oh my God! I’m so sorry!|Y’know this is actually not a great time for me.
So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!|You got Rachel pregnant?!
So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!|Who did?!
You did!|Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
Oh? Really? That’s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?|No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel.
Oh? Really? That’s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?|What?!
Oh? Really? That’s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?|Oh but not that way. I mean…I mean I’m not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?|Hey! I offered to marry her!
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?|Wh…
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?|But I didn’t want to.
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!|Tramp?!
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!|I’m sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!|Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.
Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Ma’am, are you also a stripper?|Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that’s gonna cost extra. Okay, here’s the extras, handcuffs, spanking…
Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Ma’am, are you also a stripper?|Maybe Monica’s playing a joke on ya. Y’know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that’s pretty funny.
That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.|I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.|Do you mind if I smoke in here?
How could you have kept all of this from me?|I was going to tell you, but…
How could you have kept all of this from me?|But what?! You figured you’d get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
How could you have kept all of this from me?|Hey! I did not dump Rachel!  Why don’t we just let the machine get that?
How could you have kept all of this from me?|Hey Ross. It’s Joey. There’s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you’d know something about it.
How could you have kept all of this from me?|No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I—I need to, I need to lie down.
So, tonight’s the night of the big bachelor party?|Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.
No problem. So who’s the party for?|My husband.
You hired your husband a hooker?|She’s a stripper.
No, she’s a hooker.|Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
When they’re hookers.|Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.|Why would she do that?
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?|This is the worst bachelor party ever!
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?|What’s taking you boys so long?
In a minute!|In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.|Why me?!
Hey! It’s your bachelor party.|Which is why you should do it.
I don’t want to. You do it!|You do it!
You do it!|All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?
I miss this.|I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.|Well we…we still hang out.
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y’know now it’s like…things are different.|Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married now.
Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?|Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.
You got it. Come here.|Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
You got it. Come here.|
So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!|Oh no…
So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!|I’d better go.  Just over here: I don’t want to miss the fight.
So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!|Ross I’m so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!|Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?
Rachel!|All right, I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.
Okay!|Okay.
Thank you!|That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a break!" "No we weren’t!" What happened to you two?!
Thank you so much for coming back over.|Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
Thank you so much for coming back over.|I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I’m so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You’re gonna have to tell me how you did that.
Focus.|Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
Focus.|How can I be sure on that?
Focus.|Oh we just—we drove each other crazy!
Yeah.|I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
Trying to date this woman.|Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
Probably shouldn’t touch me.|Y’know, I-I-I just…I don’t want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
Probably shouldn’t touch me.|I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single?
Should I leave this open for you too?|I’m not sure yet. Why didn’t you just tell me about all this?
Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.|Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I really, really like you. Really!|Okay, I guess you can…close the door now.
I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I really, really like you. Really!|
I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let her smoke in here?|Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
Y’know what? I’m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper|Monica! Wait!
What?|Carry on.
Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I’ll take them off.|Could you not narrate?
…just because you’re not in love with the guy you can’t…|Wow, you told your dad the truth.
…just because you’re not in love with the guy you can’t…|About an hour ago.
…just because you’re not in love with the guy you can’t…|Wanna go see a movie?
…just because you’re not in love with the guy you can’t…|Yes!
|Stupid guy on my phone.
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.|
You fall for it every time!|Hey!
You fall for it every time!|Hi!
You fall for it every time!|I brought you my old maternity clothes!
You fall for it every time!|Oh Pheebs that’s so sweet——Ooh, those are so cute!
You fall for it every time!|Yeah! And look,  And then after the baby’s born, they’re great for shoplifting melons.
You fall for it every time!|Oh, guess who I invited. Remember that guy Will Colbert from high school?
You fall for it every time!|No.
You fall for it every time!|He was in Ross’s class…marching band…kinda overweight? Well, really overweight. I mean I was his thin friend.
You fall for it every time!|Wow! I don’t remember him. Honey, are you sure you’re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend.
You fall for it every time!|No that was Jarred! Wow! I haven’t thought about him in a long time…  Anyway, umm Will’s, Will’s here on business and he didn’t have a place to go so I invited him here.
You fall for it every time!|Oh that’s nice.
You fall for it every time!|Oh, and by the way, he’s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous!  I still love Chandler.
I just want you to say it once in a while.|All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.
What?!|Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…
Phoebe!|Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!
No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!|All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet, Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.
She is?|Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.|Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!|All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.
No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!|All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time they’ll be a little baby at the table?  Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!|Hey!
Hey!|Happy Thanksgiving!
You too!|Anything I can do to help?
Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?|Sure!
I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.|Okay.
No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?|Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.  So how’s the game?
No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?|I have no idea.

No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?|I don’t believe you! That is…brilliant! And Monica has no idea?
No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?|Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
Is your team winning hon?|Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  There’s no Anderson.
Is your team winning hon?|Well I want to get in on this. Hey Mon? I don’t think I can help you after all, I didn’t realize this game was on.
Oh, I didn’t know you liked football.|Well normally I don’t, but y’know……Green Bay is playing.
You like Green Bay?|Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
Hey!|Hey!
Hey!|Happy Thanksgiving!
Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…|150 pounds. Yeah, I’m gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.

You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.|Oh hey. I’d shake your hand but uh; I’m really into the game. Plus, I think it’d be better for my ego if we didn’t stand right next to each other.
This is Phoebe.|Well done.
Wanna give me a hand?|Sure! Monica, I can’t get over how great you look! You look stunning!
Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!|I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!
Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.|Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
Good. And Rachel Green too.|Oh.
Is there a problem?|Nope. Uh, it’s okay. It’s just uh, God I hated her.
What?|Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I’m in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something?  No Will no!
What?|Y’know, it’s been a while since we’ve screamed something. Maybe we should.

What?|Oh I-I remember you.
What?|Really?! Aren’t you sweet! I gotta tell you though, I am, I am having the hardest time placing you. Oh-oh hang on! Did we umm, did we fool around at Lance Davis’ graduation party?
What?|You are unbelievable.
What?|Thank you!
|That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
|Oh. How-how big is that?
About nineteen pounds.|It’s like me when I was born.
About nineteen pounds.|All right, who would uh, like some yams? Will?
About nineteen pounds.|Oh, you’d like that wouldn’t ya?
About nineteen pounds.|What?  Oh y’know what? Can we please keep the chicken and the turkey and everything on the other side of the table? The smell is just yuck!
About nineteen pounds.|Typical.
About nineteen pounds.|I’m sorry. What?
About nineteen pounds.|I said it was typical. Typical of you, Rachel Green, Queen Rachel does whatever she wants in little Rachel land.

About nineteen pounds.|Umm, I’m sorry. Do you-do you have a problem with me?
About nineteen pounds.|I don’t know? Do I? Do I?

Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…|Yams!!!!
Okay.|Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…
Okay.|Oh, it wasn’t just me. We had a club!
Okay.|You had a club?!
Okay.|That’s right, The I Hate Rachel Green Club!
Okay.|Whoa! My God! So what, you all just joined together to hate me?! Who else was in this club?
Okay.|Me and Ross.
Okay.|No need to point, she knows who Ross is.
So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?|Yes he was.
So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?|No. No.
So who else was in this club?|Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.
So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.|You went out with her?! We had a pact!
So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.|That was in high school! It’s not like it was binding forever.
So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.|Then why did it have the word eternity in it?
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!|I swear I didn’t.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!|Yeah.
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!|Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!|Look Rach I-I’m sorry, okay? I…I was a stupid kid, okay? The only reason I joined…
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!|Co-founded!
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!|…co-founded. Co-founded the club was because I was insanely in love with you. Obviously I didn’t handle it very well. But if you think about it the I Hate Rachel Club was really the I Love Rachel Club.
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!|Uh, except that it was really the I Hate Rachel Club.
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?|Well, we did a little more than that.
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?|No-no! No-no. No-no.
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?|What?! What else did you do?
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?|We started a rumor.
What rumor?|Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Ross!|It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
What?!|That’s right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
Oh my God!|You started that?!
What?! You heard that?!|Everyone at our school heard it!
What?! You heard that?!|Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!|Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.
Monica, how come you never told me this?!|I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!|I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.
You are my Everest.|Joey, you don’t have to finish that.

Bye.|No, forget it! No way! I am not sending anymore Ralph Lauren clothes to prison. It is a waste.
Bye.|No-no-no-no-no-no, not her, not her. My youngest sister, Dina, she’s really interested in fashion, and she wants to talk to someone successful, y’know, to give her some advice.
Bye.|I guess I can talk to one of my supervisors…
Bye.|Oh no-no-no-no, she wants to talk to you!

Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?|Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.
What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?|No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Uh, I actually haven’t even met him.|Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.
Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.|There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!
Hey guys!|Hey-hey.
Hey guys!|Hi Monica!
Hey.|Hi boots.
See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…|You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…|Wow! They’re beautiful!
See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…|Ahh…
They hurt so much!|What?!
The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!|Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!
I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!|Well then get your money back and return them!
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Hey!

I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|I dropped him off at Carol’s.  Anyway, it turns out that I’m not going to be able to get those tickets though.
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Oh no! Why not?
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Well it turns out that Ben and Sting’s son do not get along.
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|How come?!
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Apparently, Sting’s son made fun of the fact that Ben’s moms are lesbinims.
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Wait! But Ross if they don’t get along then you should smooth things over. Make them be friends.
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Phoebe, you can’t force kids to be friends.
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Sure you can! Give them some blocks, put them in a playpen!
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Playpen?! Ben’s seven!
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Your kid is seven?!  Please! Please get the tickets!
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Look I’m sorry Pheebs, I can’t do it.
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Yes you can! Sting says so himself!
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|What?
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Rosssss can!

My little sister Dina!|Right! Hi Dina!
My little sister Dina!|Hi.
My little sister Dina!|Nice to meet you.
My little sister Dina!|Thanks so much for meetin’ with me. Joey’s told me so much about you!
This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business.|Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…
This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business.|I…I don’t care about fashion! I’m pregnant! And I know you are too, so you gotta help me!
This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business.|And there’s marketing…
Ahhhhhhhh!|What’s wrong?
Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning.|Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?|Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.|Why not?
Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!|Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.|You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.|Okay.
I-I can’t go in there. I can’t tell him!|Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for.
Thank you.|Okay.
Thank you.|Hey! It’s my fashion girls!  What’s wrong?
Thank you.|Honey, why don’t you sit down? Dina has something that she wants to tell you.
Thank you.|Oh. What’s, what’s going on? Is it mom? Is she sick? Is it dad’s heart? Is that a sandwich?
Joe, mom and dad are fine…|Is that a sandwich?!
Joe, mom and dad are fine…|Joey…there’s something that you…should know. Dina?
I’m pregnant.|What?!
I’m pregnant.|
I’m pregnant.|Well obviously this is a mistake! You can’t be pregnant! Because you have to have sex to get pregnant!
Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!|What?! Dina…
Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!|I can’t believe this! You’re the good one! You went to college! Both years! Who did this to you?!
Bobby Corso, but he’s a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He’s real funny.|You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh! All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Why? Where are you going?|I can’t look at you right now!
Wow.|I know.
Oh, there you are Ben!|Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.|Jack? I hate him! He’s a jerk.
Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.|I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
Him you’re friends with.|Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents.|Are you with one of the students?
Uh-huh, I’m with Ben.|Are you one of Ben’s mothers?
I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.|Well hi, I’m Jenny Boone. I’m the new teacher here.
Oh.|I’ve only met your partner Carol.
Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.|Right. Are you looking for Jack’s parents to discuss the problems he’s having with Ben?  Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?|Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.|Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?|Oh no, we can’t walk!
What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.|Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
What’s going on?|I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
What?|Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  It’s oddly unsettling.|How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Hop on.|Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…
Do you ever worry that you’ll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?|What college was that Dina?
Oh my God! Bobby!|Hi Dina. Good to see you.
Oh my God! Bobby!|Joey, what are you doing?
Oh my God! Bobby!|Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman…
Oh my God! Bobby!|Oh Joey this is crazy!
Oh my God! Bobby!|Don’t interrupt me when I’m talkin’ to God! Now where were we? Oh right, okay. Do you Dina, take this man…
No!|Oh you’ll take ‘em!
No I won’t!|Hey! You don’t get a say in this!
Yes I do!|Ahhh! I heard "I do", we’re halfway there! Okay!  You!
Yes I do!|All right Joey! That is enough!  Listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, it’s not legal. Okay? They-they don’t have a marriage license, they don’t have any witnesses, and the groom only has on one shoe!
Yes I do!|Yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.
Yes I do!|Well what am I supposed to do?
Yes I do!|You’re supposed to realize that they are adults! And that they can make their own decisions.
Yes I do!|No they can’t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!
Yes I do!|Heyyyyy! Contraceptives are not always effective!  Right?
Yes I do!|Yeah…we kinda didn’t use any…
Yes I do!|Oh, come on kids! A little help here!
Wow! This place is incredible!|Hi!
Hi!|I’m Trudie.
Uh-huh.|You must be Ben’s mum.
Why else would I be here?|Do sit down.
Uh-huh.|I gather Jack and Ben haven’t been getting along lately.
Yeah.|I’m told there are two sides to this story, but all I’ve heard is that Ben’s a bit of a poo-poo head.
Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?|Oh I’m sorry, Jack’s father is not available.
Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?|Oh no, I know that wouldn’t work. My husband’s in concert.
Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.|So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.|Are you here for tickets?
Oh, thank you. Four would be great.|I’m not giving concert tickets to someone who’d use their son like this!
Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!|Look, I’ve just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.|Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?|My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.|Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
I don’t have your boots.|Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?
Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!|Okay.  God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?|Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.
Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.|Okay.  All right.
Okay.|
Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!|Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!|Well…I really have high hopes for my band.
Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!|You were right. He is funny.
Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?|Well it’s just me and my pal Rooster, the band’s name is Numb Nuts.
|Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, that’s not a compliment!
|No Joey! I knew you wouldn’t be supportive!
|So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You’re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself…without a husband?! You can’t be a single mother alone! You’re gonna ruin your life!
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?|No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?|Excuse me?
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?|One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|Joey, I am scared to death about this. But I really think I can do it, I’m just gonna need some help. And Bobby’s gonna be here the whole time.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|You bet I am!
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|Look, Rachel’s told me how much easier you’ve made all this on her. Why can’t you do that for me?
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|Because! ‘Cause… ‘Cause you’re my baby sister!
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|And you’re my big brother! I mean, you’re my favorite guy in the whole world. I’m not even scared to tell mom and dad. I was scared of telling you.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|Well I’d be scared of them, but all right.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|Joey, I can’t stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me. I want him to have his uncle. Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|Of course he’s gonna have his Uncle Joey!
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|We’re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we’re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|That’s right! By his uncle too!
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|And by you.
Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment.|Come here!
You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!|Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Well…let’s just say…  Rosss caaaaan!|Oo, where are the seats?
Uh, middle balcony.|Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
Yeah.|Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!
Phoebe?|Yeah?
Look at that guy by the window, wow!|He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.
Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here.  Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.|Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yeah.|This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Really?! So this has happened to you?|Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.|Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Ah.|Yeah.
Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.|Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.
Hey!  Hey!|Hi!
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.|Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.|Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.|Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!|I’m missin’ picture time?!
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!|Y’know she has a face Ross!
Okay. Okay, here’s a good one of us.|Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Y’know, every year I say I’m gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?|Together? Like-like to people?
Yeah, y’know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It’ll be cute, okay?|Okay.
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?|Uh sure, sure.
Bye guys.|Bye.
Bye guys.|Congratulations! You just got married!
Bye guys.|I know. Can you believe that?
Bye guys.|Wait, I’m-I’m sorry. What’s the big deal about a holiday card?
Bye guys.|Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
Bye guys.|Hey-hey-hey, hey that’s your wife you’re talking about!
Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!|Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!|Yes, hi.
Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.|I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.
Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!|No leg-chewing for us sir.
Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?|I can’t think of anything we’re doing.  Why can’t I think of anything we’re doing?
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!|Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow!  I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!|No.
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!|That’s because he wasn’t invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!|Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn’t it?
Hi!|Hey!
Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?|Huh. Wow, this is great.
Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"|Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
How many did you want? I’m getting a hundred.|A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
Really? Why not?|Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.
Oh y’know, I didn’t think of it that way. You’re right. You’re right. So, can I ask you a question?|Yeah.
Where are we?|Huh.
Y’know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?|Hmm…
I mean I love spending time with you, y’know I just—I hope we’re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don’t you think?|Let’s do the card!
What?|The card! I think we’re there!
Okay. I—But I think we should still have this conversation.|Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Hi!|Hi!
Just so you know, Dr. Long can’t be here today, she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.|Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers…

Hi.|Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?
Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.|Oh my God.
Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.|Why did you do that?
Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.|Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.|Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.|You wish.
Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.|Hey, I could’ve had you if I wanted you.
Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.|Oh yeah? Come and get it.
Okay, even this is turning me on!|Hey!
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?|Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?|You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?|Yeah, we’re not just doing a card! Y’know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?|Ugh! Women!
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?|I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Like asking her to move in with you?
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Smaller than that.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Making her a mixed tape?
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Uh, bigger than that.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Give her a key to your apartment.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Yeah I-I don’t-I don’t think I’m quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|No, we hate that.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|That is a slap in the face.
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Forget it. I-I—Y’know what? I’ll just have the conversation. I’ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock.|Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.
Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.|Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
Oh? Why not?|It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?|Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
So why can’t the three of us go out together?|Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.|Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. Now here’s the plan, grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club.|Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.|Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
Aw, we-we are so…|Okay.
I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going?  Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?|I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?
Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.|Okay…
But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment.|Really?!
Really.|You don’t think this is too fast.
You gave her a key to your apartment?!|Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
You gave her a key to your apartment?!|Hey. Ooh Ross! How’d the conversation go?
You gave her a key to your apartment?!|Oh great, I live on the street.
You gave her a key to your apartment?!|Where?!
Hey!|Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
Hey!|Hey everybody.
Hey!|Hi Roger.
Hey!|So umm, I’m gonna get us some drinks.  Would you help me out?
Yeah.|Umm, he’s here to have sex with you.
What?|You’re welcome.
Phoebe no!|It’s okay, he’s a virgin.
Phoebe no!|Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he’ll have sex with you.
Phoebe no!|Yeah, okay let’s leave these two alone.
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!|Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?|Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.
Bing—What’s this?!|It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
No, it’s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We’re gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!|Oh no-no-no!
Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.|Hey Ross, what’s going on? You changing the lock?
No. That guy is.|I don’t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
No. That guy is.|Good luck buddy.
No. That guy is.|Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you’re-you’re sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.|What?
I love you!|Ohh!
Hi honey I’m home.|From the tequila factory?
It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!|Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.|I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
Yes. Hi, I’d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch.  I’ll call you back.|Who was that?
It’s just the pizza place.|You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.
I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.|Oh, what’s wrong?
Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.|Then why did I ask?
Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm, erotically charged.|Is that college talk for horny?
Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so…hard…to find.  So how was your day?|Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.|Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Okay, good night!|Good night.
Okay, good night!|I can’t do it!
I didn’t ask you to do it!|You’re Rachel!
You’re Joey!|You’re my friend!
Right back at ya!|But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!|I know!
And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!|Do you wanna do it?
No!|All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
That’s the end of this conversation!|This conversation never happened!
Never happened! Good night!|Good night!
Never happened! Good night!|Get back in there!
Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you’ll really enjoy.|David Schwimmer
Hey! I got you a present!!|Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!|Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…
I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!|
It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!|Oh my God!
I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.|Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.|Oh, okay.
I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.|All right.
I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.|I kinda like it here.
Do you really like it?|Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
Oh really? What was your first?|Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it.
Oh really? What was your first?|Well what did it do?
Oh really? What was your first?|Well, you just—you put a quarter in and y’know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
Oh really? What was your first?|A vending machine?
Oh really? What was your first?|Don’t feel bad for me! I won like every time!
Hey! Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.|Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so….|They made you head of the department!
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm…
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Yeah.
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Uh, Paul’s Caf�. They got great food and it’s really romantic.
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Ooh, great! Thanks!
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing—Oh! Take her dancing!
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I’ll tell ya…
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin’ all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I’m not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it’s so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Hey, y’know what?
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Huh?
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Why don’t I take you out?
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|What?! Joey, you don’t want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Yes I do! And we’re gonna go out, we’re gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out…
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Okay! I’ll go with ya! I’ll go! I’ll go with ya.
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|I’ll be fun.
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|All right?
No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.|Okay, I’m next.  Don’t! Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!
Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.|Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!
Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.|Who cares? It’s a stupid game.
Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.|You only think it’s stupid because you suck at it.
Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.|I don’t suck. It’s sucks. You suck.
Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.|No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?
Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.|Why do you want to play this game so bad?
Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.|Okay. Phoebe that’s it. Come on, get out—out of the chair. Get out!  Oh come…Phoebe!
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?|No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you.
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you.|And, a brownie!  Well, half a brownie. Actually, it’s just bag. It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin’ to feel faint so…
Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about……there.|Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so…nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s.|I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.|Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?
Hm-mmm.|Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.|No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
…which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance.  Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?|Yeah, it’s the new building on Avenue A.
What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.|Ooh, dude. That’s not gonna happen.
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?|There’s a side of steamed vegetables.
Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?|Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same.
Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.|Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date.
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?|No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don’t like me for— I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that.
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.|Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Oh my God. And that works?!|Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
Oh, you poor little famous man.|Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.
Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!|Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.
Alright. So where’d you grow up?|That’s your move? Boy Rach, you’re lucky you’re hot.
Come on, just answer the question!|Queens.
And so were-were you close to your parents?|Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Why not?|I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.
It’s gotta be rough.|Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!
Huh?|"Where’d you grow up," it’s so simple!
Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.|Yeah.
And now you’re watching me walk away.|Yes I am! Again so simple!
Hey.|You are not going to believe what I did today!
Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.|I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they don’t.
Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!|Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!
What is the matter with your hand?|Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.
Chandler, why would you do that?|Because it’s awesome.
You think this is clever?|Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.|It is when you put it together with that one.
Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.|Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.
Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.|Have you talked to him lately?
All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it.|No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work.  Chip in it or something!
Honey you-you got to beat your scores!|With the claw?!
All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.|—My hand is messed up.
I am not gonna answer that!|Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.|Chandler?
Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!|Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
I know!|I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.|I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.|Huh. Huh.
All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.|Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?|Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
How do you do that?|Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.
Oh my God!|Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
No, I don’t want to tell you.|Why not?
Because it’s embarrassing.|More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!  I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
Well, when we’re at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn’t sound like anything, but I swear it works.|Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…
All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.|Oh.
…you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!|No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?|Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.|Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.
You what?|You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.
Right. Wow!|Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars.
Right. Wow!|Hey!
Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?|Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!|Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.|Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight.
Well don’t you have that big date tonight?|Oh right!
Hey Joey, can I ask you something?|Yeah.
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?|Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
I don’t know!  I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was the lobster…|Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.|Yeah me too, all night.
Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?|Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don’t want to look in my hamper.
Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It’s got—Right— Well, you’re just a little bitch, aren’t you?|—Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
They’re all Chandler.|Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!
They’re all Chandler.|I did.  But it came at a price.
But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.|Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.|No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?
You mean like from behind?|Yeah. Yeah, that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah.
Ew, y’know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!|Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I’m talking about.
Totally! Wow!  Would you excuse me for a sec?|Oh yeah, sure.  Ehhh.
Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!|I know!
Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!|One more score to go! You can do it!
Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!|Don’t touch me!!
Don’t touch her!!|All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Don’t touch her!!|I can’t!! I can’t!!  Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
Don’t touch her!!|Phoebe!!
Don’t touch her!!|Oh hi Ben—No!! Don’t look at the machine!
Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching Cujo.|Alone?!
Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!|Hey, did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car and Cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?
No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?|Oh uh, it didn’t work out.
Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?|Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Y’know, I never thought I’d say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies.  What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.|Oh sure, yeah, why not?
Okay.  Okay, that’s him! That’s him! That’s Cujo! That’s Cujo!|All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay.
Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch!  Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren’t you scared?|Terrified.
All right. It’s a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don’t feel that now. It was crazy! You’re fine. You’re better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything’s normal! She’s just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.|Hi, sweetie.
Hi.|Are you, are you high?
I just had the most amazing bath.|Really? I don’t like baths.
Wait, you like them with me.|Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.
Oh, baths are so relaxing!|Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you.
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Well, neither.
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Oh my God, what’s up?!
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|I don’t know. It’s-it’s just…lately, I’ve been feeling… Okay, here’s what it is…
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Oh no-no, no you don’t, just come back.
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that’s different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Do you?
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|In London?
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Yeah.
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|If that.
Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!|Right.
Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!|Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?
Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!|No-no, we talked about it. We don’t want to know. All we care about is that it’s happy and healthy.
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!|And smart!
Popular.|With an aptitude for science.
Popular.|Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?
Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!|Really? Me too!
Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!|Me too!
Really?!|Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!
Really?!|Maybe. But it wouldn’t hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?
Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.|Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Okay fine, what do you have?|Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there, but…Darwin.
Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.|Yeah, by Sandrine.
Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.|You’re just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!
I’m really, really not.|How-how about you each get five vetoes?
I’m really, really not.|All right.
All right.|That sounds fair.
Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.|Veto.
Why?|Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
Why?|I know her! I bought homemade soap from her at a Dead show!
Why?|Okay, how about, for a guy, Thatcher?
Ross, why do you hate our child?|Fine, you go.
Okay, James.|Huh.
But only if it’s a girl.|Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?|Veto. Stewart?
Veto. Sawyer?|Veto. Helen?
Veto.|Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
Hey.|Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
Sex on the balcony?|No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?
What is it?|I drew you a bath!
Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?|Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!
Well, this does butch it up a bit.|I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?|Absolutely.
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?|Bet I know how that discussion’s going to go.
All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.|So?
Oh my God.|I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?|Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?|Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?
Uh, no. No, we’re not.|But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
Uh, no. No, we’re not.|That’s right. But if you don’t want to know…
No, no, we want to wait, right?|Right. Right.
No, no, we want to wait, right?|Oh, I’ll be right back. And, uh, I know it’s really not my place, but please don’t name your child Phoebo.
No, no, we want to wait, right?|So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?
What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.|Third one from the left?
Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it.  Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!|What?!
You’re looking!|I didn’t!
I saw you!|Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!|Okay, but Ross just listen to me…
No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!|But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?|Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Hello?|I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.
You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.|I’m in the bathtub.
Oh.  What’s wrong?|I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!
What?|The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.  It’s interesting.
Okay, let’s talk about something else.|Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…|I had the exact same conversation.
You did? What was he talking about?|I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
That was a long night.|All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Okay, he was talking about rules.|Uh-huh.
Umm, and looking at people differently.|He didn’t say anything about that to me.
What did he tell you?|He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.|But what did he mean by rules?
Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!|Because he was looking at her differently.
And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!|My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!|You guys?
Just a minute!  That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!|You don’t say anything.
Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?|I’m not going to let you say anything.
You just stay here!|Oh, God!
You just stay here!|Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.
Oh, you had that?|Uh-huh.
I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.|Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.|What?
Nothing.|Okay.
I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.|Fine.
It’s a humdinger!|Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.
Somebody likes you!|Is it Chandler?
No!|Well, then tell him to stop staring!
It’s Joey!|Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.
Is it something you’d be interested in?|I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.
I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?|Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
Not Chandler, just Joey.|Sure.
Hey.|Hey.
You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.|Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!
I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.|I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
I would—Sequoia?|Veto.
Fine.|Unless…  You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
But Ross, you want the name Ruth!|Not like this!
Hey.|Hey. Well, what’s up?
Umm, Joey, I know.|What?
I knooow.|Whaaat?
I know about your feelings.|Oh my God. You do?
Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.|I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.
For God sakes, it’s Rachel!|I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!
Yeah that’s Rachel.  Beat me over the head with it.|What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?
Yeah.|She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.|You think?
Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.|Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.
That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.|Not really.
So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.|What?
That’s right. The student has become the master.|Ross, I swear, I don’t know.
Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!|A what?!
You really didn’t know?|We’re having a girl?
No.|That’s what you just said!
No.|You said girl!
Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.|I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!
I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!|Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…
Permission to veto.|Yes, please.
Hey.|Do I smell essential oils?
Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.|Okay.
What do you think you’re doing?|L-leaving my troubles behind?
I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.|Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.
Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!|Hey!
Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!|Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.
Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!|You told her?!
She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?|Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!
What?|Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?
I don’t think I’d care.|Really? Lee Majors is hot!
I don’t think I’d care.|Hello?
I don’t think I’d care.|We’re in the bathroom!
I don’t think I’d care.|Why?
I don’t think I’d care.|Because it’s a relaxing and enjoyable time!
I don’t think I’d care.|What are you guys doing in here?
Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!|You like Rachel?!
Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!|It’s no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It’s just a crush! It’s going to go away!  Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!
Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!|Mazel tov.
Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!|
Honey, cover it up with the boat!|Hello?
Honey, cover it up with the boat!|Yes we’re all in here and we would love for you to join us!
Honey, cover it up with the boat!|Hey, did you, did you tell them?
Honey, cover it up with the boat!|No, I was waiting for you!
Honey, cover it up with the boat!|Tell us what?
Honey, cover it up with the boat!|We’re having a girl.
Honey, cover it up with the boat!|Oh, wow! Yay! Wow! Hooray! Oh, man!
Honey, cover it up with the boat!|I’ll…I’ll get you later!
All right. It’s a new day, and it’s just a crush, that’s all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everything’s going to be fine. It’s just a crush.|Hi, sweetie.
It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?|Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.
I’m not touching you.|You’re not?
It’s the salts.|Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
Hey, what’s up?|Well, I left my guitar here again.
Oh, okay. No problem.|Okay.
Okay.|Oh.
Here you go.|Okay.
Okay.|Great! Umm…
What?!|So do you want to hang out or something?
Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.|Oh are you and Chandler…
Yes! Exactly.|Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
|Hey Pheebs, what’s up?
|You ask an intriguing question Chandler Bing.
|Oh my God! You’re getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!
Phoebe, I can explain!|You told me you hate massages!
Phoebe, I can explain!|Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaning…Don’t let Phoebe in.
Phoebe, I can explain!|I can’t believe this! How long as this been going on?
Well umm, Alexandra has been…|Oh, it has a name?
Phoebe, don’t get upset!|Okay—Oop! Too late! I’m leaving! Come on Chandler let’s go!
Phoebe, don’t get upset!|Well, Phoebe I thought I’d—
Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we’re almost there! We’re almost there!|Oh Joey, I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re having this baby together. I love you so much.
Oh, I love you too.|And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but, you’re the best sex I ever had.
That’s always appropriate!  Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!|Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
That’s always appropriate!  Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!|
That’s always appropriate!  Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!|Joey! Joey!
What? What’s going on?|Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Aaaah…|Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
Really?!|Yes!
Oh, y’know what? Maybe uh, you…you should come to me. I’m a not, I’m not wearing any bottoms.|Oh, okay!
Oh my, oh my God!|Aw, it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she’s like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
Mia Hamm?|Mia Hamm!
Oh that’s amazing.|Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Hey babe.|Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don’t like us do they?
Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?|No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?
How about to the street say from the balcony?|Why don’t we just find a place for it?
Okay. How about in that cabinet?|No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
How about the closet by the bathroom?|Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?
Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?|No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?|Feminine stuff.
Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!|Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you’ll let it go.
Fine.|Thank you!
Love you.|You!
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|Why won’t you let me massage you?
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|Well it’s…I mean I’d just—I’d be self-conscious. You’re my friend; I’d be naked.
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|Monica! We lived together for years! I’ve seen you naked!
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|That’s different, we were roommates! And when?!
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|I’m curious about the human body.
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|Hey, come on Phoebe, you can understand why this would be weird for me.
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|But I’m a professional! And I’m really good! Look, if you’re uncomfortable we can stop. Just give me a chance, okay. Please?
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|Okay, if it means that much to you…
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|It does! How would you feel if you couldn’t share your cooking? Or-or imagine how Ross would feel if he couldn’t teach us about dragons.
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|Dinosaurs.
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|Potato, potaato.
Hey!|Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!
What?! It is?!|It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?|Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?|A dreamless sleep.
My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.|Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel.
Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.|Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Are you under the sheet?|Yes.
How’s the pressure?|Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.|No. Ooohh…
That’s right, you just enjoy.|Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
Okay.|Oh God Phoebe!!
I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I swear!|Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.|Why not?
I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!|I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?|Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
And here we go…|I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy!  Stupid closet full of bugs!
And here we go…|Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don’t—Whoa!!
And here we go…|Oh hey whoa-whoa, don’t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.
And here we go…|Really?
And here we go…|Absolutely. But, we’re gonna stop by the hospital just to be sure, okay? I’ll page Ross on the way. Come on.
And here we go…|Okay. Oh God—Ow!—Oo!
And here we go…|Okay Rach-Rach-Rach look at me, look at me, everything’s gonna be fine, trust me. Okay. Take my hand. Here we go.  Oww crushing bones!
Hey! So?|She’s fine. She’s experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
Hey! So?|Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you’ve had one of these Braxton thingies?
So but everything is normal.|Absolutely.
And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?|No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don’t know what they are, but she’s fine.
And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?|Thank you doctor.  Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.
Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!|But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!|But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!
You sure?!|Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?
Oh hey-hey!|Is everything okay?
Oh hey-hey!|Yeah, everything’s fine!
Oh hey-hey!|Your page said come to the hospital, what? What was it? What happened?
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.|Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.|Okay, no uterus, no opinion.
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|Oh you went to the movies by yourself?
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|No I—Mona!
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|Oh, I gotta go back in there.
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|What? Why? What’s wrong?
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|No, everything’s fine. I just gotta go back…
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|No really, you tell me what’s up.
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|I-I forgot my underwear.
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|So, thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.
Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.|Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.
Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.|Oh and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in. You’re gonna make a wonderful father.
There has got to be a way!|Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Yeah.  Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old girl.|Then why do you throw like one?
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.|Sure. "Monica."
So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?|Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
That’s a good idea.|Yeah.
Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?|Oh, I just…I feel terrible.
Hey.|Hey.
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!|No-no, I got that.
So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?|Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.
Okay.|I mean $500.
What?|600.
What’s going on?|Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
What?|Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!|Really? There’s nothing sexual about this?  I mean hi.
Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!|No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
Really?!|Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.
Are you sure?|Yes.
I guess.|Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!|Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum!  Did you put pickles on this?|Well yeah!
Oh Ross!!|What?! What?! Rach what?!
Oh Ross!!|What’s going on?
Oh Ross!!|I made her favorite, tuna salad with pickles.
Oh Ross!!|Pickle? Pickles make her sick. Giving her pickles is like giving me salad.
Oh Ross!!|I-I’m sorry Rach, I didn’t know. Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?|I’m on it!
Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?|I can’t believe this! I shouldn’t be the one making her throw up!
Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?|Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.
Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?|Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don’t know any of it and I’m the father. I wish I’d be more involved y’know.
Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.|Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.|Yeah.
What’s up?|Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Are you breaking up with us?|The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot of the stuff, okay?  And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…
Yeah?|Maybe you two should live together.
Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?|Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.
But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean——Or he does.|No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
But Ross, its you and me!|So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
But Ross, its you and me!|All right now, so? What do you think?
I don’t know. Is it crazy?|No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
I don’t know. Is it crazy?|Well, I was due.
Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in.|Really?
Yeah.|Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great.
Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools.  Oh my God!|How did you get in there?!
You’re messy.|Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!
I married Fred Sanford!|No Chandler, you don’t understand!  Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick.
No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.|Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?
Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.|Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.
Hey.|Hey.
So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?|Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick.
Are you okay?|Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way. I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
Ohhh.|That’s it. Just relax.
Ohh. Oh! Ohh!|Come on more!
Oh God!|Yeah, you like that don’t you?
Oh yeah right there!|You want it there? You take it there baby!
Uh Phoebe?|Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm we’re never doing this again.
Oh! Hey, Rach!|Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!
Oh, you, too.|Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?
Oh, you, too.|It’s good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages?  Oh, thank you. I’ll see you guys later.
Okay.|Bye.
Okay.|There’s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?|Thanks. But maybe later.
Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?|You want anything?
Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?|You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine’s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that’s never going to happen!
Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?|We have red bagels.
Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?|Oh, okay.
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?|Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.|Uh, I’m going to take off.
All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!|What is it?
It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?|All right.  ‘Candy and Cookie?’
Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?|Phoebe, c’mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
Oh, Monica, grow up!|Hey, what’s behind your back?
Oh, Monica, grow up!|Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe’s opinion on for Valentine’s Day.
Oh, Monica, grow up!|You don’t want my opinion?
Oh, Monica, grow up!|Not really.
Oh, Monica, grow up!|Come on, I’m your older brother, ask me!
Oh, Monica, grow up!|All right, big brother.  Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
Oh, Monica, grow up!|The red one.
Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.|No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
He-hee!|Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!|Thanks so much, Pheebs!  Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Happy Valentine’s!|Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
|Yeah, just relax.
Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!|Now, push!
Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!|Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!|Ohhh! Make it stop!
Did I just throw this?|Hi.
Hi.|I accidentally packed these with my stuff.  Who is this?
Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.|
I’ve still got it!|Why did you get me this?
What is it?|It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…
Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?|I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.
Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine’s Day…  Oh, wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?|Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.
Honey, what’s going on?|Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
Mm-hmm.|How long it took to go back in the water?
Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!|You don’t know. You didn’t see it.
Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.|Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!|See, honey, there’s—
Hi!|Hey!  So, how was Atlantic City?
Good.|Yeah?
I brought you back a present.|Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.
I think it’s interesting.|I do too! I missed you!
I missed you, too! So, how was your week?|Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
How exciting!|Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.
Oh no.|Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Yeah right!|What?
Joey cracks me up! It’s like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn’t be awkward at all!’|Huh…uh-huh.
So, what’d you tell him?|
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?|I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.|Ever?!
Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?|Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.|Hey!
Hey.|Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog?  Did you give him a beer?
No.|Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.  Oh, me, right!|He’s miserable! What happened to him?
Nothing. We just talked about stuff.|What stuff?
Rachel stuff.|Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
He’s breathing!|Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.
Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?|Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—|Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—|Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!|Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine’s dinner! Surprise!
Ayyyayyyy!|Oh, hey, Mona!
Ayyyayyyy!|Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel!  What’s she doing here?
I have no idea!|I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
I have no idea!|Seriously, what is she doing?
Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.|Why?
I think she’s lonely.|Okay, but it’s Valentine’s Day!
I know.|Can’t we just ask her to go?
No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.|I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!
No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.|Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?
Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.|You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.|You got another ex-wife back there?
|I’m just going to grab the phone.
|Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but, but, um… what are you doing?
|Oh, I’m sorry! Do you need the phone?
|No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don’t you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
|But, but, Mona, I live here.
How long has it been this time?|90 seconds.
That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.|You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?|I can do that.
Okay.|Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.
Oh, thank God!|Oh, I know!
Come in!|Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
Oh, my God.|Poor Ross.
Oh, my God.|Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.|Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.|Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.|Well, let’s just say it’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.|Well, now, wait. Now I’m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!|C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!
She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.|Okay, here we go.
She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.|Okay.  Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.|Why have I seen this thing three times?!
It’s…still beautiful.|Uh! It’s horrible!
I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!|Oh, my God!
I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!|Wait, you guys, look!
I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!|What? Did her ass explode?!
I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!|No, the baby’s out! Look, look!
Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!|And look how happy the mom is now!
Oh…Rach!|Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!
Hey, hey, man!|Hey, what’s up?
Uh…Mona just dumped me.|Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?
Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?|Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.
Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?|Sort of.
Really?!|You don’t have to seem so happy about it.
Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.|Oh, I…I d—
Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?|Forget about it. It’s no big deal.
C’mon! Joey! What is it?|It’s nothing.
Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?|Okay, uh…sit down.  Um… there’s this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen.
She’s not a Tribbiani?|No!
I knew it. So, is she someone from work?|Yes.
Well, uh, does she like you?|Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.
Why not?|Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.
So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?|No. I don’t think so.
Okay. Um… is he a good guy?|Yeah, he’s the best.
Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.|Oh, I don’t know.
Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.|I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.|Here’s your warm milk.
I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.|Oh, yeah.
Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.|It’s Rachel.
|I came to the big city to become a star! I’ll do…anything to make that happen!
|Anything?
Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.|Previously on Friends
There’s this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it’s complicated.  She’s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’Ccause we’re really good friends.|So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?
Yeah, he’s the best.|Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Oh, I don’t know.|Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—|Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say it’s Rachel?|Yes.
Um, you…you like Rachel?|Yes. I like Rachel.
Rachel?!|Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.
But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!|Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.
It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?|I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?|Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.
Y’know what? I-I gotta go.|Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…
I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!|Rachel?!!
Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!|Oh!  She’s growing inside you.
Whoa!!|Oh!
Wow that was a big one.|I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Wow that was a big one.|Oh hey you guys!
Wow that was a big one.|Oh hey!
Hi!|Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.|Uh-huh,  and you?
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.|No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don’t think they exist.
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.|Okay, good.
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.|Why?
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.|Well last night, I met Monica’s.
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.|What?
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.|Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.|Come on, don’t be crazy.
Well, what’s he like?!|Well he’s tall.
Uh-huh.|He has brown hair.
Of course, of course.|A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Of course, of course.|He works with food!
Oh sure. Older?|Obviously, and he’s British.
Oh, I was just gonna ask!|Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.
Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.|Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.
Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.|Oh, I’m so sorry. Um, and maybe I’m wrong! I but—y’know I’m gonna go out with him again, I’ll find out more.
Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.|You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you’re still gonna date him?
Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.|Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl’s gotta eat.
Hey.|Hey.
I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.|Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!
All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.|Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.
Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.|Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.
Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!|He’s not?
No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.|Why?
He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him.|Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him.  It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?
Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.|Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.
Oh! Hi!|Hi!
Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.|Oh, hello.
Soul mate.|What?
Soul mate.|So, what have you guys been doing?
Soul mate.|Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the sun-dried tomatoes at that place?
Soul mate.|I know! What is this, 1985?!
Soul mate.|That’s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn’t that strange.
Soul mate.|Not really.
Soul mate.|What’s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?  No?
Soul mate.|So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?
Soul mate.|Well, Octavio, 27&7—Oh! And there’s this great little place, Alessandro’s.
Soul mate.|Oh my God! That’s my restaurant, I’m the chef there.
Soul mate.|You’re kidding me!
Soul mate.|No!
Soul mate.|Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu, once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?
Soul mate.|Oh, I’d like a latte. Oh y’know what? If you’re gonna talk about me, I’m gonna go with you.
Soul mate.|What are you doing?!
Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…|I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.|Phoebe, good work.
Yeah?|Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him.
Hey.|Hey.
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.|No, I don’t want to hit you.
Oh what then? Kick me?|No.
Bite me?|No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?|Uh…yeah sure.
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…|Okay.
|Thank you.
Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…|What?! You’re in love with her.
Yeah, I thought you knew that.|Umm, no.
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I’ll get over this." Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?|I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.|No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…|If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.
Are you sure?|Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…
Hey thanks.|So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?|I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.
I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!|Yeah, tell me about it.
…so I’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.|Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Excuse me?|Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I’m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.|Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
And you’re still married to him?|You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries…  And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat.
Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I’ve got a great little villa you can stay at.|Is it made of cheese?
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!|I’d move in tomorrow!
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!|Are you listening to this?
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!|I’m so sorry.
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!|What do we do?
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!|I don’t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I don’t know how you fight that.
Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight.|Joey? What’s up?
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.|Okay what’s up?
Here? In the hall? What are we animals?|Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.|Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?|Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.|Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Jeez! What is with you?|I’m sorry, did you say cheese?
All right, what’s going on?|Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?|No. But I’m sure  ‘tomatoes’ does.
I don’t believe in soul mates either.|You don’t?
No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.|So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?|I love you.
I know.|Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.
…and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.  Are you okay?|What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…—Is it hot in here?
No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?|I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?|Yeah. Sure.
Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.|Uh… How long have we known each other?
Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.|Uh-huh, long time.
Yeah.|But over the past few weeks…
Yeah.|Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a couple specials tonight…
Yeah.|Actually uh, could you give us a second?
Yeah.|Sure. Sure.
So you were saying?|I’m not quite sure.
Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are.|Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you.
What?|I’m falling in love with you.
Okay. Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?|Does it really matter?
Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.|Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  Okay, you gotta say something!
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…|But.
Joey.|Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think I’m gonna go.
No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!|Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that.
Can I?|Sure!
Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…|Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!
I’m so sorry.|Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry.  Y’know I was only kidding you.
Is this your table?|Yeah.
God, you’re gonna be here all night!|I know! I haven’t even read them the specials yet!
What’s the matter with them?|I don’t know. I think maybe one of them is dying.  The guy is really cute!
What’s the matter with them?|Steven Rosenhaus
What’s the matter with them?|R. Lee Flemming, Jr.
Oh God! That’s Rachel!|Joey, you have to talk to her!
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Hey!
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Hey!
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Hey Rachel!
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Is Joey here?
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|I don’t see him.  Do you see him?
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|I don’t see him. Hey! Maybe he’s in the sugar bowl!
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Well, at least you make each other laugh.
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|What’s up?
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Well, I haven’t seen him since that night that he told me how he y’know… I don’t know, I think he’s avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|We were playing a game.
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Sure.
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|What?! No! No!
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh…tell him I miss him.
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Okay, did you hear that?
Yeah, a naked bagel game?  Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.|Honey, you gotta talk to her.
I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.|I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.|Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they’re hungry.
All right so, so what do I do?|This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Yeah. Okay.  I almost forgot this was on your…|We didn’t play it!!
Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.|I didn’t know you read tea leaves.
Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.|Okay, I’m done. Read mine.
Okay.  Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.|I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.
Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?|Okay, I’m done. Do mine.
Okay.  Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.|Ah.
Oh!  Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!|Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Oh!  Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!|What does yours say Pheebs?
Umm… Wow, all right.|Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
Umm… Wow, all right.|You mean your pink shirt?
Umm… Wow, all right.|Faded salmon color.
Umm… Wow, all right.|No, I-I haven’t seen your pink shirt.
Umm… Wow, all right.|Great! Great. Then I must’ve left it at Mona’s. I knew it!
Umm… Wow, all right.|Well, I’m sure you get another one at Ann Taylor’s.
Umm… Wow, all right.|That’s my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
Umm… Wow, all right.|Well just ask Mona to give it back!
Umm… Wow, all right.|I don’t know. I mean I-I guess I could. It’s just that we didn’t really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I’d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.
|Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
|Hi!
|Hey.
|Hi.
|Hi.
|Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.|I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|Let’s just say if I can’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|In the James Taylor case.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|Where is the James Taylor CD?
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|Honey, I’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we’re just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|Well, if we’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y’know alphabetically or by genre?
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|Hmm, I don’t know. We really have to talk this through.
Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!|Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
Oh yeah. That makes sense.|Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
Ooh, I can do that.|Good.  Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
Ooh, I can do that.|They were just giving those away at the store  in exchange for money.
Ooh, I can do that.|Hey!
Hi.|Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
What?|Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow!
What?|So you uh, have a…big work problem?
Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.|Huh. Okay.  So uh, I think I’m gonna take off.
Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.|Yeah?
Yeah, and umm my baby.|Yeah?
My boss wants to buy my baby!|What?! Oh my-oh my God!
I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.|What he wants to buy your baby?!
Can you believe that?!|That’s crazy!
That’s what I told him!|Okay, how did this even happen?
Well I’ll tell ya!  See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."|Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
Oh hello.|Oh, it’s you. I see you everywhere. I’m Jim, Jim Nelson.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.|We have. Maybe we’ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o’clock?
Mona?|I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
Mona?|Oh, it’s okay.
Mona?|No, it’s still wet. Y’know what? Let me get it out before it sets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here.
Mona?|Oh umm, I-I don’t know if I want to wear a woman’s shirt.
Mona?|No-no that’s a man’s shirt.
Mona?|It’s awfully pink.
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.|Honey, both yours.
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.|Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.|Yeah? The work problem?
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.|Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
What problem did you tell him you had?|Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.
May I help you?|Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.|Someone does. Me.
Oh, witty banter. Well done.|So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at this place…|Do you like to party?
I-I-I like, I like parties.|You’re wild, aren’t ya?
Yeah I guess, a little.|It ain’t no thing, I’m wild too.
So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.|I’m sorry. I’m staring. It’s just that you have the most beautiful eyes.
Oh stop it.|And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.|All right.
Okay.|I write erotic novels, for children.
What?!|They’re wildly unpopular.
Oh my God!|Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
Wow! You do?|Yeah,  a Pretty Huge…
…there’ll be sun.|Hey!
…there’ll be sun.|Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
…there’ll be sun.|Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy’s not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
…there’ll be sun.|What?
…there’ll be sun.|Let’s just say I took care of it.
…there’ll be sun.|Whoa-whoa-whoa, let’s say more!
…there’ll be sun.|Don’t worry! Don’t worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don’t go buying people’s babies, so back off!!"
…there’ll be sun.|What?!
…there’ll be sun.|What?!
…there’ll be sun.|No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn’t want to buy my baby! I made that up!
…there’ll be sun.|What?! Why?!
…there’ll be sun.|So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn’t be awkward!
…there’ll be sun.|And you couldn’t think of anything else?!
…there’ll be sun.|You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
…there’ll be sun.|I can’t believe that you yelled at my boss! I’m-I’m gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
You can always sell your baby.|Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!
You can always sell your baby.|You lied to me!
You can always sell your baby.|Well, she told me too!
You can always sell your baby.|Chandler has two copies of Annie!
Oh my God! Ross!!!|Hello!!
Ross, what are you doing?!|Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Morning. You wanted to see me?|Please, come in. Have a seat.
Okay look Mr. Zelner…|Oh I think it’s best that I speak first.
Yeah.|I’ve asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
Oh God.|If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby…I am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
Oh there it is.|That’s not your regular dry cleaners.
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…|What?!
A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?  When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.|Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.|Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
Okay.|Wow!
What?|I’m sorry, it’s just that you’re so incredibly beautiful.
Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?|I hope you don’t think I’m crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
A little.  Now you’re talking.|Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.|Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Hi.|So? What-what-what happened?
It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.|Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.
Chandler, can you give us a minute?|Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?
Yeah.|I’ll be in there.
Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…|I know. I know.
It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.|Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little bit.
Yeah I know! I miss that.|Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
|Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
You do?|Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t. It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.
Oh God you’re right.|Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
|Mark Kunerth
|Peter Tibbals
Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?|Yeah.

Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?|So, who’s the guy?
Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.|Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers?  Who said that?
Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.|Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.|Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?

Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.|And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.|No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they’ll say this year? "God, you"
Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.|Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying.
Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.|Really you can do that?
Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.|Are you kidding me? Watch!  Well I can’t do it with you guys watching me!
What are you doing?|Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.

Ha!|Ah, actually, I’m sorry we-we probably should get going.
Ha!|
Ha!|I, uh, think you already are.
Ha!|Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than—Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
Ha!|That’s my old dog. He passed away years ago.
Ha!|Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where’s the party?
Ha!|It’s out on the island. It’s in Massapequa.
Ha!|Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber’s Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwin was born in Massapequa.}
Ha!|Well, there is an Arby’s in the shape of a tee-pee.
Ha!|Okay, I got my note cards.  Do you got the presents?
Yeah.|And I’ve got the car keys.
Yeah.|We’re driving!?
Yeah.|Yeah.
Yeah.|Aces!
Yeah.|So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
Yeah.|Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
Yeah.|Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
Yeah.|Yeah, otherwise I’m not going.
Hi|Hi!  Hey mom.
Hi|This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
Hi|Jack?
Hi|Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
Hi|That’s a good question, dad. That’s a good question…
Hi|Hmmm….
Hi|Congratulations you two!
Hi|Thank you…we’re so excited
Hi|And also, congratulations on your wedding.
Hi|Wha—What?
Hi|Can we talk to you for just a y’know… It’s just a little thing. Well we think it’s absolutely marvelous that you’re having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we’ve told them all that you’re married.
Hi|What?!
Hi|Thanks for going along with this.
Hi|Dad so what we have to pretend that we’re married?
Hi|Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
Hi|Can you believe that?
Hi|Yeah, if you’re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
Hi|No, us having to lie about being married.
Hi|No, I know I don’t either, but ya know what, it’s their party, and it’s just one night. And we don’t even have to lie; we just won’t say anything. If it comes up again, we’ll just…smile. We’ll nod along.
Hi|Ross!
Hi|Rachel!
Hi|Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
Hi|Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding
Hi|Hmmmm….
Hi|Here’s a little something to get you started.
Hi|Oh…
Hi|So, how’s married life treating you?
Hi|Unbelievable!
Hi|We love marriage!
Hi|Great!
Hi|Hey
Hi|Hey!
Hi|What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C…I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don’t want to forget this moment! It’s like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click!
Hi|I don’t think the flash went off.
Hi|Dahaaa!  I’m going to find the men’s room, be right back.
Hi|I’ll go with you
Hi|Come on!
Hi|Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
Hi|I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don’t want him complimenting my thing.
Hi|I’m so we weren’t in the car! Did he ever let up?
Hi|He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
Hi|
Hi|Were you guys making fun of Parker?
Hi|That depends, how much did you hear?
Hi|So, he a little enthusiastic, what’s wrong with that?
Hi|It’s just that, it’s so much.
Hi|Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you’ve dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don’t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? ‘Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who’s who of human crap.
Hi|I feel terrible.
Hi|I know
Hi|What was wrong with Mona?
Open it! Open it! Open it!|Yeah baby!
Open it! Open it! Open it!|So we never got to hear about your wedding!
Open it! Open it! Open it!|We were surprise that we weren’t invited.
Open it! Open it! Open it!|No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.|Where did you have it?
On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.|Really?
Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend.|Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.|Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm…. what are you doing?
What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.|Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|No, I’m fine. I’m great. I’m with you.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|And I’m with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing.  What an inspired solution to man’s plate dispensing problems.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|Hm huh, yeah.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|No, that’s not necessary.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|Please.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|No, actually I don’t eat…
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|I won’t quit until you try.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|Okay, fine! Fine!  Mmm…hmmmmm….
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|What are they like? I’ve never had one.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|Why don’t you just try one?
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|No, they look too weird.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|What are you doin’?
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit ‘em. I can’t wait. They’re going to be crying so hard. They’re going to be fighting for breath.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could .
And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.|Blind?
Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.|I’ll bet you looked beautiful…
Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.|So, how did you propose?
Oh yeah. That’s a great story.|Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…
Oh yeah. That’s a great story.|Oh that is so sweet!
Shhh! I want to hear the rest!|Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Then you better do it now.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Why?
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Because I’m going to kill him
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|What-what?
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|You guys were right. He’s just too excited about…everything. I mean I’m all for living life, but this is the Geller’s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let’s call a spade a spade this party stinks.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|I know I’m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Are you sure it wasn’t an oyster?
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|I guess it could’ve been, I didn’t really look at it. Y’know, I just wiped it on Chandler’s coat and got the hell out of there.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|He’s just such a great guy I’m so excited about him.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There’s nothing wrong with him he’s a good guy.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|You think?
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|You’re right. You’re right, he’s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I’m a sunny, positive person.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|What’s that now?
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Nothing…
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Oh look it’s Parker!
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Look! It’s the bunny hop!
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Oooh I love it!
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|You do?!
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Okay it’s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I’m going to do it.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|No, no it’s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don’t say it enough, but I love you.  You people are made of stone! Here’s to mom and dad! Whatever!
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn’t it interesting, Jack?
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Why don’t I remember this dog?
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Ross, why don’t you give us your toast now?
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Oh, no, Mom, it’s just Monica this year.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|You’re not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|No, of course, Um… Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say…on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if…if in 35 years, we’re half as happy as you guys are, we’ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Oh Ross…
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross’s toast.
My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!|Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words…|Oh thank God.
It’s a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst…|Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
That sounds great.|Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.
I love games!|Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
Or…Jenga.|But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
I lose, now Jenga.|Oh my God! Oh my God!
Is something wrong?|Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!|You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.
I’m sorry that’s who I am. I’m a positive person.|No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?|Much less happy!
Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I’d better be going."|So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
Isn’t this the most incredible fight you’ve ever had in your entire life?|Uh huh.
…and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!|Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?|It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.|Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Yeah.|That proposal, at the planetarium…
I know, I know it was stupid.|Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.|Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.
It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night|Goodnight
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?|I will think about it.
Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.|Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Oh, come on.|Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
Hi!|Hey!

So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?|No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?|Why’d you say no?
So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?|Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.
So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?|If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.
Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?|Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?|Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.
Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?|Just then or-or all the time, ‘cause we-we have jobs y’know.
Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green.  Seriously, proud of you.|Yeah.

You think we’re being obvious?|No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
Y’know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y’know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.|Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
Y’know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y’know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.|Can I get you anything?
Umm, I’ll have a cup of coffee.|And I’ll have all the muffins.

Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.|And there is Kevin.

So this is it? Victor?|Yeah, I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship,  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonna want to meet her.

So just, just shut up and close your eyes .|Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.

Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.|So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!|Your make-up!
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.|I think face to face.
I would say that.|Face to face, yeah!
Okay, here I go.|All right.
Okay, here I go.|Oh my… How much do you weigh Ross?!
I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.|Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.
Hey Pheebs!|Hey!
Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!|Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
You’re turning into a woman.|No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.
Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?|It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it… Oh My God, I’m a woman!!!
Great nap.|It really was.
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.|So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.

No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.|Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.|Oh, I do.  How you doin?
I'm okay.|What?!?! Oh dear God!
Not much to tell there I’m really shy.|So, that’s it. I guess that’s all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
Oh great! Great! Thank you.|Bye.
Bye-bye.  I did it!|Yeah!
Bye-bye.  I did it!|Amazing! Amazing!
Bye-bye.  I did it!|Oh wait! I almost forgot. We have to ask everybody this. Other than Days of Our Lives, what’s your favorite soap opera?
Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?|Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.
Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.|Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.|You slept with her didn’t you?
Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.|Little bit, yeah.

Hi!|Hey!
Hi!|Hey!
So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?|About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?|Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care, as long as my mom’s here.|Oh my God, your mother!
What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!|Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
My God!|Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
My God!|Well I don’t, I don’t have a mother so often I forget that other people…
My God!|Oh give it a rest!
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!|No.  Neither is mine.
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!|Okay, y’know what? Don’t worry, okay? We’ll take care of it. We’ll call her. Just go home and get ready.
Please, make sure she comes. It’s really important to me, I mean it’s my mom!|I know. I know, what’s her number?
I don’t know.|Go! I have it in my book. Go!  Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it’s Monica Geller.
I don’t know.|Oh, hello Monica.
I don’t know.|Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we’ve decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
I don’t know.|I know, my daughter’s told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
I don’t know.|Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m-I’m so sorry.
I don’t know.|For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
I don’t know.|Please! Please! Can you come? It’s today at four.
I don’t know.|Well all right. I’ll see you at four.
I don’t know.|Thank you.
I don’t know.|Isn’t it at three?
I don’t know.|Son of a bitch!
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?|Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?|Oh cool!
That’s great.|Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I’ll  Joey Trrrribbiani!
You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!|But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.
You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!|Well do you want some help?
You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!|Oh really? That’d be great! You guys can be the contestants!
You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!|Awesome!
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.|All right! Let’s play Bamboozled!
Bamboozled?|Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?
Bamboozled?|Yeah!
No!|All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t you tell us a little something about you Ross?
No!|Well uh, I-I’m a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben!  And uh…
No!|I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
Well Joey, I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!|Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
Bogota.|It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
What does a Wicked Wango card do?|I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Higher or lower than what?|This is embarrassing.
Can you believe how lame this is?|I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?|You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!|Hi!
I’m so glad you could make it.|Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
I’m so glad you could make it.|Try. There’s my little girl.
I’m so glad you could make it.|She’s still mad.
Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.|Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?
No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.|Okay. I can do that.  I gotta go powder my ass.
Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn’t know better I’d say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let’s get some tea.|Okay.
Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don’t want you to use your housekeeper ‘cause it would just split her focus.|Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a housekeeper.
It’s like you’re a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don’t know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.|Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.
Such a sweet woman.|Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that.
Oh Rachel!|What?
I just had the greatest idea! I’m gonna come live with you!|Wh-wh-what? What?
Oh, I’m so happy I’m gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.|Yes. Yes I do.
All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?|The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take another question.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.|It’s okay, I’m ready.
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the question.|This is ridiculous, he’s not gonna hold his breath…
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?|Let me see that.
This one right here.|Triscadecaphobia.
This one right here.|The fear of Triscuts!
No! No, fear of the number 13.|Fear of Triscuts?
No! No, fear of the number 13.|It’s possible, they have really sharp edges.
All right Chandler, you’re up.|Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
All right Chandler, you’re up.|This game makes no sense!
All right Chandler, you’re up.|Y’know what? You’re just upset because you’re losing.
All right Chandler, you’re up.|Oh come on Ross, I think we’re all losers here.
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.|Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.|Either, it makes no difference.
Choose, you jackass!|I’ll take a card.
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!|What?!
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!|This game is kinda fun.
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!|You don’t think it’s a little crazy that you get all my points just ‘cause you…
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!|I don’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
Why did you invite my mother?!|What?
She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.|For how long?
Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.|I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.|She can’t hear you.
What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?|Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!|That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Okay.|This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel! Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
Okay.|I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It’s time to open the presents!
Okay.|Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you’re the most important person in this room. And in the world!
Okay.|Well uh, I don’t have a gift because I wasn’t invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone’s attention.
Okay.|How about you less important people, let’s open your presents!
Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!|Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.|Sweetheart I know you’re gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.|Really? Remember Twinkles?
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!|Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!|Oh look.
Wow!|Okay, this is from your friend at work.
Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is!  Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?|Darling, that’s a breast pump!
Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?|It’s a diaper genie.
Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!|No! It’s where you put the dirty ones!
Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?|Oh you’re gonna do that ten times a day?
What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!|No dear, that’s what babies do.
What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!|Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!|Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you’re trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table?  What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!|You can’t leave a baby alone!
Oh come——Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.|It’s actually a bassinet.
In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!"|Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Correct! There’s a possible backwards bonus!|Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Yes!|I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
Wise choice, how many rungs?|Six!
That noise can only me one thing.|Hungry monkey.
That noise can only me one thing.|I’d like a Wicked Wango card!
Okay, it’s an audio question, name this television theme song.|Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
Okay, it’s an audio question, name this television theme song.|Tell it to the Time Turtle!
Okay, it’s an audio question, name this television theme song.|Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
Yes! Yes, you’re back in the lead!|I’d like to spin the wheel!
Yes! Yes, you’re back in the lead!|Oh come on!!
All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!|Is there a hopping bonus?
Who invented bifocals?|Ben Franklin.
Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?|Queen Victoria.
Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!|Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Now, over to Chandler.|I’d like a Google Card.
Are you sure?|Yes!  Google!
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you’ve been Bamboozled!|Nooo!!
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you’ve been Bamboozled!|Yeah!!
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you’ve been Bamboozled!|This is the best game ever!!!
So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?|Of course I am!
Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?|No. Sweetie, you’re gonna be fine.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?|I’m going to the bathroom.
Okay.|Now don’t worry! Everything’s gonna be okay.
Okay.|It is going to be okay!  It was worth a shot.
Okay.|Hey!
Okay.|Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
Okay.|I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
Okay.|Not if you were here.
Okay.|Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.|A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.|Uh, what?
Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.|What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.
Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.|Hi Ross!
Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.|Hi roomie!
Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.

Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|Uh Joey, didn’t your agents give you the revised rules? We’ve eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|What—Why?!
Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn’t follow it.
Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|Well what’s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You’re in Paradise Pond!
Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|Yeah all that’s gone. It’s basically just a simple question and answer game now.
Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|Well what’s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that’s just people standing around answering questions?
Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|Well, there’ll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|Let’s play Bamboozled!
…and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.|Well we…we don’t have a garage.
Did I say garage? I meant garbage.|Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.
Well Rachel needs help with the baby.|I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.
Well Rachel needs help with the baby.|I’m-I’m sure that’s not true.
Well Rachel needs help with the baby.|Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
Well Rachel needs help with the baby.|No, not a thing.
Well Rachel needs help with the baby.|It’s frightening.
Well Rachel needs help with the baby.|Well uh, y’know what? Even if she doesn’t know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn’t live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
That’s true. You do have another child.|Yeah.
With another woman. Have you no control Ross?|That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
Well then you really don’t need me to live with you.|Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed.
You’re gonna be a great father.|Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma.
You’re gonna be a great father.|Hello?! I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing!
You’re gonna be a great father.|Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You’ll—you’re gonna pick it up.  Hey! You will! Uh look, y’know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy’s credit card. Do you remember?
You’re gonna be a great father.|I hope you’re going somewhere with this.
You’re gonna be a great father.|Look at you! What—You’re-you’re this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you’re gonna be an incredible mother.
You’re gonna be a great father.|Really?
You’re gonna be a great father.|I’m telling you.
You’re gonna be a great father.|Thank you.
All right you two, I’m gonna get going.|Oh.
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.|What do I do?
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.|Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she’s been nothing but terrible to you. And don’t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn’t even thanked you for it.
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.|Y’know what? You’re-you’re right.
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.|Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I’d tell her off.
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.|Really?
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.|Uh-huh!
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.|Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green!  It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn’t on purpose! But what you’re during to me now is just plain spiteful!
Spiteful?!|That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!
Spiteful?!|Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up…
Spiteful?!|So whenever you’re ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day!  I can’t feel my legs!
Spiteful?!|You were fantastic! I’m so proud of you!
Spiteful?!|Yeah? I’m proud of me too.
Spiteful?!|You should be!
Spiteful?!|Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
Spiteful?!|You got it!
Spiteful?!|Okay.  Okay, I bit my tongue, but I’m still really sorry!
Okay! I’m ready.|You sure?
Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.|All right then.  How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?
Uh, put your elbow in it.|Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.|That’s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!|Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
A card! A card! I pick a card!|Oh, I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother!
A card! A card! I pick a card!|Brian Buckner & Sebastian Jones
A card! A card! I pick a card!|Dana Klein Borkow
Hey you guys I got some bad news.|Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.|Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though.  "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.|Hey!
No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.|Hey.
No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.|Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
Umm…|Oh dear God!

Yeah, they all know.|Oh my God, this is horrible!
Yeah, they all know.|I’m so sorry.
Yeah, they all know.|I’m so humiliated!
Yeah, they all know.|Yeah but y’know what they say Mon, "There’s no such thing as bad press."
Yeah, they all know.|You don’t think that umm,  "The chef’s Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
Yeah, they all know.|I didn’t write it.
Yeah, they all know.|Is he right? Am I really—Am I awful?
Yeah, they all know.|No!
Yeah, they all know.|Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I’m not just saying this because I’m your friend, I’m sayin’ it ‘cause it’s the truth. You’re food is abysmal!
Ross!|What?! What?
I am freaking out!|Are ya?
My due date is in one week!|What are you doing up?
That is seven days!|Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after…
No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!|It’s funny you should mention diapers.
I’m serious.|Okay look, there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this little…|
Oh, wait Ross! I’m sorry, one more thing!|Yeah!
Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that, isn’t that weird?|Well uh…
Hey uh Monica, I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?|We said at the movies, but…
Okay, I’ll see you there.|Joey!  Now that you’re here…
Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya.  What uh—How come you’re not going?|I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
I thought you already have a job.|And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!|That’s what I do now.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!|Hey Joey, come taste this.
What is it?|Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well…  I’m getting my revenge!
You cooked him?|No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
You cooked him?|The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don’t ya?
Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?|Oh.
Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?|Oh.
Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?|No-no-no! No, no, no, we’re not married.
Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?|We are having a baby together, but we’re not involved.  Or, yes stranger, we’d like this delivered please.
Why don’t you fill out this address card.|Oh, okay.
I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.|Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple.
I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.|I chose those, I’m a paleontologist.
Really?! That is so cool!|Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor, but he’s not.
Oh no-no, I’m fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?|Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Oh no-no, I’m fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?|Oh my God! I’m standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I’m bored.
Oh, I love your neighborhood. There’s a great gym right around the corner from your building.|That’s my gym.
I can tell you work out.|I am like Indiana Jones.
Hi Pheebs!|Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore.|What?!
Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.|Well did she know you two weren’t married?
Yeah.|Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.|Sounds like you’re a little jealous.
No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!|Is that a real place?  Are they hiring?
No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!|Fatty!
No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!|Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!|Well, I got a job interview. It’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!|Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!|Me! I do that. So… Seriously, do I look okay? I’m little nervous.
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up.
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Why not?
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Well, the interview…
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|What about it?
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Y’know! You don’t make a very good first impression.
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|What?!
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Oh you don’t know.
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Are you serious?!
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|What is it that I do?
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Well it’s just like you’re trying too hard. Always making jokes, y’know, you just—You come off a little needy.
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Did you like me when we first met?
Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s.|Still?
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.|I don’t see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.|Either eat it, or be in it.
Spoon?  So, what do you think?|I’m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
Spoon?  So, what do you think?|Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there’s a new class comin’ in.
Spoon?  So, what do you think?|Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
I can.|Okay, go ahead.
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.|That’s very good, what’s your name?
Monica.|Monica, you go to the head of the class.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?|My son? Pretty serious.  What uh, what are you doing here?
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?|Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?|Ah, must’ve been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?|Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?|Oh.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?|Oh uh…I actually came here to ask you out.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?|Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I’m just gonna put this  back in my pocket, pretend that didn’t happen. Uh yeah, actually I’m free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or…
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?|Sure!
So you guys go, have a really good time.|
So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.|Are you okay with this?
Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.|Okay. It was nice to see you.
Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.|Oh umm, actually I umm…
I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?|Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.|All right, don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
An hour.|I can’t help you.
Phoebe!|All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange."
Chandler Bing.|Bing, what an unusual name.
Hi.|Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?|And the cream?
Cheese makes me thirsty.|Okay. Let’s move on.
All right.|Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You’ve never made this before?
All right.|Oh no! I don’t know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it’s called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
All right.|Well, hats off to the chef.
All right.|I-I-I’m sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn’t hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
All right.|The chef!
All right.|That’s right.
…I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.|Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do.
What I do do…is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.|I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.|You gotta go!
Oh!|Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready.
Really?|Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.
Ah Monica, my star student.|Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
|Wow! A star!  I know you all hate me and-and I’m sorry, but I don’t care.
Okay Joey, you’re up next.  This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!|I can an A? In-in school?  Hey, I’m a dork.
Okay Joey, you’re up next.  This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!|Joey! I’m so proud of you!
I think you should give him your star.|Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!
We’re all beginners here. Nobody knows what they’re doing.|I do! I’m a professional chef!  Oh relax! It’s not a courtroom drama!
If you’re a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?|Yeah!
If you’re a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?|I’m-I’m sorry, it’s just that umm… Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro’s, and umm I just got a really bad review…
Oh Alessandro’s! I love that place!|You do?
Oh yes! You’re an excellent chef! As a person you’re a little…|Oh, I’m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
Very much.|Okay then, I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay.
Very much.|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don’t want to go. I’m having fun.
Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?|Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it’s time to go, it’s time to go.
…also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.|You must’ve had your hands full.
That I did. That I did.|So let’s talk a little bit about your duties.
All right.|Now you’ll be heading a whole division, so you’ll have a lot of duties.
I see.|But there’ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
Good to know.|We can go into detail…
No don’t I beg of you!|All right then, we’ll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you’ll fit in well here.
Really?!|Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.|Poo?
Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!|Poo?!
Hey.|Hi! You’re back from your date!
How are you?|I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?
Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.|Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?|No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a little slutty, but who isn’t?
I liked her.|Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!|No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me.
Why? What was wrong with her?|There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
Okay, so what’s the matter?|I don’t want you to date her!
Why? What, what are you jealous?|Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
Okay.|What?!
I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all the time.|Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.
True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our baby.|
Do you feel better?|No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
Uh Rach?|Yeah.
Just one thing umm…|Uh-huh.
We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?|Wow! I don’t know, maybe. I’m…
Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin’ around!  Like you did last night when I had to pee?|I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!
Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…|Oh no-no-no-no, no!
…that you actually…|No that’s just——That’s just ‘cause I’m such a good messer!
Rach?|Yeah?
The bathroom?|Right!
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade, and I didn’t have to sleep with the teacher this time.|Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
What the hell!|Okay.
What the hell!|All right, let’s start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
Hey! What are you guys looking at?|Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, check it out.
Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!|Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in THX! I’m unsuitable for children!
Now I cannot wait to see this.|Yeah, yeah, it’s already generating Oscar buzz.
Now I cannot wait to see this.|I started that!
Now I cannot wait to see this.|I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and you’re all invited!
Now I cannot wait to see this.|Are we gonna take a limo?
Now I cannot wait to see this.|Sure! Why not?!
Now I cannot wait to see this.|Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!
Now I cannot wait to see this.|Well obviously I won’t be able to come, for those of you who haven’t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y’know, I just want to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you’ve been during this time. I really couldn’t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss being pregnant.
That’s right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!|Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here?
You. Like you haven’t done enough.|Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!|Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…
Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!|Let’s.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|What are you doing here so early?
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y’know what? Screw ‘em! If they don’t want me there, I’ll just hang out with you guys.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Or you can do volunteer work.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Hello?
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Joey! It’s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You’ll be sitting next to HotGuy372.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Oh my God. So that’s it?! I only get to bring one guest?
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up?  Hello?
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|What-what about me?
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|You said you didn’t want to go.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|I don’t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I’m pregnant you think I’m invisible.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Definitely not invisible.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Well, well Ross didn’t care enough to be here, so I think he’s out. You snooze you lose.
He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.|Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.
I haven’t seen this dress.|Star in a movie.
I haven’t seen this dress.|Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you?  Phoebe, Phoebe.
I haven’t seen this dress.|Well uh…I think I want to take Chandler.
I haven’t seen this dress.|
You really want to take me?|Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
So you’re never actually going to pay me back?|Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
So you’re never actually going to pay me back?|It’s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it’s-it’s everything. Y’know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn’t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn’t believe in myself.
I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.|Thanks. That means a lot to me.
I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.|Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.
I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.|
|Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink.
|When she comes out, you hold her nose, I’ll blow in her mouth, and the kid will just  right out of her.
|She’s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?
|I don’t know. I-I think it’s still gonna be a while.
|Hmm, care to make it interesting? I’ll bet you that she’ll have it by this time tomorrow.
|You’re on!
|Okay, how much?
|One hundred thousand dollars!
|How about fifty bucks?
|Fine! I’ll call Zurich and move some money around.
|All right, who’s turn is it to help me get up!
|No one’s here!  Oh damnit!
This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?|A little tall.
What?|Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?
Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.|Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.|Damnit! Damnit!! Here’s your fifty bucks!
It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?|Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Fine! You’re on!|Okay.
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|She’s in the bathroom.
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|Rach, we gotta go.
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|In a minute!!!
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|People ask me why we’re not together, I just don’t know what to tell them.
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|All right, all right. Let’s go!
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor’s keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry…
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|No, I’m fine.
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|Really? You don’t think that’s a little inappropriate.
Good God man don’t anger it.|Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
Good God man don’t anger it.|Fine! Fine! Y’know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You’re the mommy.
Good God man don’t anger it.|Oh uh-uh pal! Don’t call me mommy! It’s bad enough you call your own mother that.
Good God man don’t anger it.|I’m actually with her on this one.
Ross.|Yeah?
Can I ask you something?|Uh-huh.
When Carol was pregnant with Ben…|Mmm?
…were you this irritating?|Wow!
Excuse me?!|Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.|Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.
Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!|Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!
Hi Dr. Long, how are you?|Oh, you’re nice to her.
She has the drugs!|We’ll do a quick check.
Okay.|So, eight days late huh?
Yeah.|You must be a little uncomfortable.
Eh, just a tad.|You’re about 80 percent effaced, so you’re on your way. It still could last a little while longer. If you’re anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
Eh, just a tad.|Do them!!
Eh, just a tad.|Actually, they’re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I’ve found that some of them are quite effective.
Well, we are ready to try anything.|Okay, there’s an herbal tea you can drink.
Okay.|You can take some caster oil, there’s eating spicy foods…
Great! We will do all of those.|…taking a long walk, and then there’s the one that’s proved most effective: sex.
Great! We will do all of those.|You’ve got to be kidding me!
Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!|You liked it? You really liked it?
Oh-ho-ho, yeah!|Which part exactly?
The whole thing! Can we go?|Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.
I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!|Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?
I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.|You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn’t take any of my suggestions! That’s for coming buddy. I’ll see you later.
Hey!|Hey.
Hey!|Hi!
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?|No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?|Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea, caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.
What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?|Well, there is one thing that we haven’t tried, but someone thinks that,  "That will open up a can of worms."
Well what is it? What is it? If it’s gonna help bring the baby here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.|It’s sex.
Do it!|Monica!
I’m just saying it’s been a really long time for you. I mean, women have needs. Do it, get yours!|Oh I-I don’t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic.
All right, let’s be practical, if Ross isn’t willing to do it, he’s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow Chandler—Chandler is good!|Monica, what is the matter with you?
Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.|Why? Why today?
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!|What?! While she’s been going through this hell, you’ve been making money?! You’re betting on your friend staying in this misery?!
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!|I’ll take that bet.
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!|What?!
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!|Well, I’m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!
Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you’re gonna have the baby and I don’t want to lose again!|Can I get some of that action?
Wait a minute! Now I’m betting against all three of you?|Oh honey, don’t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow’s the day.
Hey! Sleeping beauty!|Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?|I’m so sorry.
Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between us! Okay? You’ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?|What?!
Give me a number, I don’t want to owe you anything!|You don’t owe me anything, I don’t want you money…
Ah-ah-ah! We’re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head shots. Right, how much were those?|I don’t know, five hundred dollars?
Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?|Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.
Okay, so that’s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred, that’s…|Do you want a calculator?
Please!|Here!
All right, what else?|Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes…
Which we’re still keeping under our hats!|Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
What the hell are you talking about,  "The south will rise again man."|Yes, money well spent!
Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!|Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food…
Come on, finish your enchilada.|Ross I—We tried all the spicy food. It’s not working.
Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha… Oh God! So…so hot!  By the way, you don’t want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.|I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes me want to have sex with you.
Stop it.|Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We know what’s gonna work! It’s doctor recommended!
I’m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I’m dying.|Oh come on Ross, we’ve done it before we’ll do it again, it’ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.
This is insane, I’m not gonna make love to you just so that you’ll go into labor.|Make love? What are you a girl?
Always a great way to get in a man’s pants.|But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of me as a ketchup bottle, y’know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out.
I love when you talk dirty to me.|Oh, I know it. You’re right. That’s not sexy. Oh…Oh!  Oh God!
Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.|Come on Ross! I’m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.

Oh good.|I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
Okay, what’s up?|I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
Ma, you’re asking me to marry you?|This is your grandmother’s engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
Mom no, come on! Thank you.|Just hear me out!
N-no! Okay? We’ve been through this! We’re not gonna get married just because she’s pregnant, okay?|Honestly! Ross, this isn’t just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
Mom, y’know what? I-I can’t deal with this right now. I’m sorry…|Just…think about it. If you don’t, I’ll talk more about humping.
Gimmie!|Hi!
Gimmie!|Oh hi dear!

…she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I’m not with Rachel.|Yeah.  Why aren’t you with Rachel?
Are you kidding? Look, we’re not gonna be together just because we’re having a baby. Okay?|But y’know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.|Right. And with who again?
Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.|God. He’s crazy! Why doesn’t he want to be with Rachel?

Okay, stop it! I can’t deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.|I mean seriously, she’s like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn’t and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and…  I haven’t bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
Hey. Who’s that?|New people.
What happened to the Disgustingtons?|They’re having their baby! It’s not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?|Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
Yeah? Okay.|Ooh! Ow!!
Yeah? Okay.|Are you looking at her?!
Yeah? Okay.|No!
Yeah? Okay.|Don’t you look at her you sick bastard!
Yeah? Okay.|Honey I swear! I wasn’t looking at her!
Yeah? Okay.|She’s in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
Umm. Umm, I’m-I’m just gonna—|See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
No-no, I’m…I’m sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.|You miss your girlfriend?
Just ignore them.|Ross.
What? What?|He’s looking at me.
Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!|Don’t you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?|I’m not crazy about babies. I’m crazy about us.
What?|Look, we’ve always talked about having babies someday. I’m not saying it has to be right now, but I’m starting to think that we can handle it. We’re good. We’re really good.
We are pretty good.|But nothing has to happen until your ready.
Well maybe I’m ready now. I mean, it’s a little scary, but maybe it’s right.|What?! It’s not right! We’re not ready to have a kid now!!
What?!!|I’m kidding. This is going to be fun.
So we’re gonna try? I mean, are we trying?|We’re trying to get pregnant.  Y’know I’m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
Okay, hold on a sec.|Period math?
Yeah.|Yeah.
Well, we could start trying. Now.|Right here?
No, not here. Maybe here.|Wait a minute, it’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we’re in a building that’s full of beds!
Come on you stupid machine! Come on!|Oh, it ate your money?
No.|All right, I’ll see you downstairs then.
All right.|All right.
