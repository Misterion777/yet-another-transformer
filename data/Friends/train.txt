There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!|C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.|Sounds like a date to me.
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.|Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.|Instead of...?
That's right.|Never had that dream.
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.|And they weren't looking at you before?!
Hi.|This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...|Cookie?
Thanks.|Ooh! Oh!
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?|Fine!  Be murky!
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.|No you don't.
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!|And you never knew she was a lesbian...
No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?|Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.|Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number?
Sorry.|Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!|And I just want a million dollars!
Hi.|So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.|Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...|Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...|bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.|And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!|What, like there's a rule or something?
Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!|Who's Paul?
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?|He finally asked you out?
Yes!|Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
Rach, wait, I can cancel...|Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?|That'd be good...
Really?|No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.|Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...|A wandering?
Monicage!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.|Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
Shut up, Joey!|So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.|I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.|Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
You guys.|Oh, God.
Oh my God!|I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?|Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
-leg?|That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.|Ooh, steer clear of you.
I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!|Shut up!
That only took me an hour.|Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...|What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.|Stay out of my freezer!
Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...|What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.|Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
Isn't there?|Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform.  ...Sexually.|Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
It's okay...|I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
Two years.|Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?|...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.|Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?|Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,
Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.|That is amazing.
Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.|If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
Hello, Paul.|Hi, Paul, is it?
So, like, you guys all have jobs?|Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?|I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.|I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
Oh, yeah.|Well, it's like that. With feelings.
Oh wow. Are you in trouble.|Big time!
Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.|I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
Oh, look, wish me luck!|What for?
Hey, Monica!|Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
You had sex, didn't you?|How do you do that?
Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?|You know Paul?
Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.|You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
Of course it was a line!|Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!|Guess what?
Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.|C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
I know that. That's why I was getting married.|Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
Thank you.|You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!|You can, I know you can!
I don't think so.|Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!
Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...|Rachel!  That was a library card!
Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?|No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
You be okay?|Yeah.
That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.|Goodnight.
See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?|I just grabbed a spoon.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.|I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.|There's an image.
What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.|Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
Absolutely.|Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?|Well, she has issues.
Does she.|He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?|Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
No. No.|Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
Hi.|So.
You look great. I, uh... I hate that.|Sorry. You look good too.
Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...|A lesbian?
Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?|Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
Why- why are you here, Carol?|I'm pregnant.
Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.|...Then I've already seen this one!
Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.|She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!
Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.|Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!|What?
Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!|Eeaagh!
You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...|I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
...Dinah?|Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...|I just... can't do it.
Boys? We're going in.|.....Hi.
Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?|Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.|Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?|Curry.
Mmmm!|I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
They all had a thing for him.|Aw, Mom...
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-|No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
Well, they don't have to know that...|Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.|I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.|I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...|What's that supposed to mean?
Nothing! It's an expression.|No it's not.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.|No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Your folks are really that bad, huh?|Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.|Hi.
How could I forget?|Ross.
Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?|Dr. Oberman.
..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-|She.
-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?|Yes, and she's very supportive.
Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh.|Thanks.
Quack, quack..|Ross? That opens my cervix.
Barry?|C'mon in.
Are you sure?|Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!|Yeah, well..
I dumped him.|Okay.
So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?|Give me a 'for instance'.
Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?|Marlon-
Marlon?!|-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
...As in Mouse?|As in my grandmother.
Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?|Julia..
Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?|Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
Oh, that's great.|Why are- why are you so tanned?
Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.|Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.|Me?!
No!  I went with Mindy.|Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.|Oh! Well, um..  You've got plugs!
Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.|And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.|Okay..
See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.|Wow.
You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.|What?
Well, thank you for giving it back.|Hello?!
Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?|Helen Geller? I don't think so.
It's my baby too.|Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!|All right, you two, stop it!
Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!|My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
Look at that.|I know.
Well? Isn't that amazing?|What are we supposed to be seeing here?
Then don't do that, alright?|Okay!
Monica. Whaddya think?|Mm-hmm.
Wh- are you welling up?|No.
You are, you're welling up.|Am not!
You're gonna be an aunt.|Oh shut up!
Hi guys!|Hey, Pheebs! Hi!
Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'|Ohh. Ouch.
Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.|And everybody knows this?
"So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"|"Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."
Hey, that was really good!|Thanks! Let's keep going.
Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"|"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."
I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.|What?
Not so much!|Whoah!
Hey!|Hey!
Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.|No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.|Y'miss it?
No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.|That's ridiculous!
What did they do to you?|It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
We're with you. We got it.|Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
Hey. Whaddya doing?|Oh! Oh, God!
Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.|This Alan again? How's it goin'?
'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.|So when do we get to meet the guy?
Let's see, today's Monday... Never.|Oh, come on! Come on!
No. Not after what happened with Steve.|What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.|Well, then can we meet him?
I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.|Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.
I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.|Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..
Let it go, Ross.|Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!|Hey, Pheebs.
Chandler! He's here!|Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
C'mon!|...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?|Yeah!
Really!|Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?
Hi.. how was the game?|Well..
Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?|Alan.
Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..|What?
..I dunno, a little too Alan?|Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
Hey, Lizzie.|Hey, Weird Girl.
I brought you alphabet soup.|Did you pick out the vowels?
Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you.|Saltines?
No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?|What?  Oh my God, there's really money in here.
I know.|Weird Girl, what are you doing?
No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.|No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.
Oh, that's fine, no.|Would you like my tin-foil hat?
No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.|Please, let me do something.
Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?|Okay.
Keep the change.  Sure you don't wanna pretzel?|No, I'm fine.
See ya.|Huh!
A thumb?!|Eww!
Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.|Oh,  "you do, do you"?
You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.|"Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.
Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?|No.
Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.|Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!
Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.|Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!
I know.. it's gonna be really hard.|Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.
Do you have any respect for your body?|Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.|Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?|I think he's across the hall.
Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.|Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!|I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
Wow.|I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.|Relieved?
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.|Yeah. He could row like a viking.
Alright. Phoebe?|Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?|Probably kill myself!
..Excuse me?|Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
How does she do that?|I cannot sleep in a public place.
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.|Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
What's going on with you?|I got no sleep last night!
Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.|Thanks.
Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.|Ohhh.
Wow, you worked in a mine?|I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
Yeah, yeah.|Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.|What are you guys doing here?
...Poulet passes it up to Leetch!|Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.|Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry. Sorry.
Yes, Bunny?|Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
Could've been a peach.|Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.
So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!|Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
Okay.|When are you coming home?
What? Guys, I'm not.|C'mon, this is us.
I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-|Waitressing?
Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.|Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?|What's that?
Weeeell, it's rum, and-|Okay.
We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...|Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.|Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.|But I haven't used my card in weeks!
That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.|They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?|Alright, c'mon!  Let's play Twister!
Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.|What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...|C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!|Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
Ah, the other Jack.|Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.|Oh, like that's a word.
...Pheebs?|Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!|See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
Pass it! Pass it!|He's open!
'Scuse me.|It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.|
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.|No, you were right. I don't have a plan.
Thank God. Food.|Phoebe?
No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.|Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?|Big Bird's friend.
Hello? Who are we spying on?|White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!|Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
Light still out?|Yeah.
Oh. Maybe they're- napping.|Oh please, they're having sex.
I think he's shy.|Yeah?
I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.|Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
Look, it's just a little more complicated...|Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...|Then what?
My first time with Carol was...|What?
It was my first time.|With Carol?  Oh.
Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?|Uh-huh.
Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!|Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
What?! You slept with Jason?|You'd already broken up.
Oh, that's nice!|Okay, okay, okay, I got one!  Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
Excuse me?!|Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one?  She was a big girl.
Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!|I was laughing! You made me laugh!
Where?|Right- where we've been looking all night!
Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!|Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the——wowww.
Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?|I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
Really?|No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..
Oh, ah- the kid has it.|The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
Okay, Monica: Right foot red.|Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue.|Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
Green. To the green.|Never-never mind.
Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.|Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!|No plans, huh?
Not a one.|Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
Oh, right, right, shut up.|Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.|Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.|No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.|Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.|Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...|Oh, god help us.
What?|Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.|What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.|Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.|It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
Nuh-uh.|Yuh-huh.
So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?|Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear—you want it to be dirty?
No.|Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.|There you go.
Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?|Yep.
Which?|Which what?
You've never met Bob, have you?|No, but he's...
Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...|Hey, Joey.
Where are they? Where are they?|This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.|Eww, I don't wanna do that.
Here we go.|Ok, have a good break-up.
Hey, Janice.|Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?|We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
What?|What?
What... did you get me there?|I got you...these.
Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.|Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?|No, no, I'm still working on mine.
That's it?|Yeah, it was really hard.
Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.|Ok, you weren't there.
Comin' through. Move, move.|Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.|But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.|What?
No suds, no save. Ok?|What's goin' on?
Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.|Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
So, where did you guys grow up?|Brooklyn Heights.
How, how did that happen?|Oh my god.
What?|I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
So, you and Angela, huh?|Yep. Pretty much.
You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.|Huh, I never really noticed.
Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.|Monica, Monica is great.
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.|Yeah, isn't he?
It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.|You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.|Huh. That's nice.
Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.|Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.|That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  Uh-oh.
What uh-oh?|Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
Ross, what's the matter?|Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
Come on, show me.|All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
Oh, everything's pink.|Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
Oh my god.|What?
Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.|Come on, they're close.
Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.|Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's—not really true, is it?|Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
Oh my god, what were you thinking?|All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
Oh!|Ow!
I'm outta here.|Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
Really?|Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.|Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom.|Ow!
Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?|Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.|Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
Oh, I don't know, a million?|Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
I'm fine.|All right.
I'm not fine. Here she comes.|Wait here. Breathe.
How do you do that?|It's like a gift.
We should always always break up together.|Oh, I'd like that.
You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.|Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.|I could not have done this without you.
Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.|Are you sure?
Oh, are you sure you're ok?|Yeah.
Does it still hurt?|Yeah.
Where's Chandler?|Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!|You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
God. I feel violated.|Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!|Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
What is it?|The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Hey, kids.|Hey.
Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.|Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...|...Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories.
We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.|...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon.
Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?|'We' would be me and Rick.
Who's Rick?|My husband.
Oh, so you're divorced?|No.
Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?|No, I'm still married.
So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?|Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan.
Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?|Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?|I suppose mainly sexual.
...Hm.|Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?|Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!|Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
Tah-daaah!|Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.|Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
Well, whaddya think?|Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.|Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.|Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?|...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
Alright, alright, alright...|Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
For what?|Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.|Thank you!
He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!|C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!
I warned you...|Who is being loud?
Oh, you got the whole night, huh?|Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know..
Okay, everybody ready?|Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Lose the robe.|Me?
That would work.|Right. Okay. Losing the robe.  And the robe is lost.
And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?|Well, I'm- I'm showering.
No, that was clenching.|Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?|I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
God, I love these fingers...|Thank you.
No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.|
Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go..|Okay.
Don't go.|Okay. Oh no, I have to.
Too bad, she's leaving.|I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.|It's not Rick.
What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!|No, it's-it's Andrew.
I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?|He's... new.
Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?|No, that's not exactly what I was..
Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.|So what do you want?
You.|You have me!
Nono, just you.|Whaddyou mean?
Lose the other guys.|...Like, ...all of them?
C'mon, we're great together, why not?|Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.
...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'|So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...|Which one?
...The second guy.|Well, call me if you change your mind.
Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?|Hey!
No? What happened, big guy?|"Big guy?"
It felt like a 'big guy' moment.|I got fired.
Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?|Hard to tell, I was naked.
Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.|Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go.  OK, thank you very much.
Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!|Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
Wow, you guys, this is big.|
Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.|Hi Mom, it's Jill.
She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!|Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.|I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
Hi everyone.|And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.|Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
You're definitely scaring here.|
Hello?|Hey, it's me.
Are you OK?|Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
What?|I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
I have no idea what you just said.|Put Joey on the phone.
Alright, somebody.|OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
Um... Ross?|Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
Oh come on, I already went.|You did not go!
Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.|Step back.
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.|Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.|Come on.
No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.|And you didn't marry him because...?
I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...|Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
Yeah right.|It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
OK.|But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
You don't.|Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
Really?|Mmmm.
You do?|I do.
Oh Ross, you're so great.|It's never gonna happen.
What are you shushing?|We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?
Ahhhh!|See?
Would you like some gum?|Um, is it sugarless?
Sorry, it's not.|Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
|OK, here goes.
About what?|My surprise party!
What surprise party?|Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
Well, he didn't tell me.|Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.|No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
Hmmm... this is so nice.|OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
OK.|OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
Ohhh!!!!|Yes, yes, that's right...
Oh, look at the little cat!|What?  Ow!
This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.|Sorry, that was wax.
Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?|Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?|Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
Wait a minute. What's his name?|Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
Oooh! You are a very bad man!|You owe me a cat.
Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...|
Lucky sixes....|Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
So, um... where did Paolo come from?|Oh... Italy, I think.
No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.|Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.|Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.|Are you alright?
Yes... thank you. That was... that was....|Perfection?
|Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
Paolo. Hi.|Ross!
Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.|Thing?
Thing, yes. Thing.|Ah, you... have the sex?
No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...|Bed?
No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.|Oh!
Yeah! Se vice?|Si.
So you do know a little English.|Poco... a leetle.
Do you know the word crapweasel?|No.
Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.|OK.
Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...|Thank you.
Thanks.|Kinda... spooky without any lights.
Well, this has been fun.|Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.|Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
Hey gorgeous, how's it going?|Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.|Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
Do you want a date Saturday?|Yes please.
Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-|He's a he?
...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?|Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
You did?|Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?|I did.
You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?|No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?|I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?|Yeah! Right!
WHAT IS IT?!|Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.|Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
So, uh, how's she doing?|The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.|Oh God!
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.|Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
I know.|Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
G'bye, Nana.|Bye, Nana.
Ross!|What is going on?!
I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?|Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.|Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
I was just thinking. When my time comes-|Dad!
Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.|You what?
I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.|Define fun.
C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...|...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.|That's probably what they'll say.
Hey, gorgeous.|Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.|Oh! Okay! Phew!
So, uh... what do you think it is about me?|I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
...Quality, right, great.|Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?|What? He's cute!
Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.|Is Brian...?
No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.|Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
This one?|No.
I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.|You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.|Wait! We need shoes!
Okay. Um, how about these?|That's really a day shoe.
And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?|Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.|No, it really should be burgundy.
Oh my God..|Is everything all right, dear?
How we doing, you guys ready?|Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
Some days it's all I can think about.|Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?|Morning. We ready to go?
It was a really beautiful service.|It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart.  Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.|What, what is it?
You missed a belt loop.|Oh! No-n-
Okay, it's in spasm.|Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?|I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
Ooh! That's so nice...|...Chandler!
Hey, who's this little naked guy?|That little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.|Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?|Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Hey, Lowell.|Hey, Chandler.
So how's it going there in Financial Services?|It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.|I know. That's what I told her.
Really.|Yeah.
So- you can tell?|Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
So you don't think I have a, a quality?|Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
He is?|Yup, and waaay out of your league.
Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?|An advance?
It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.|Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful.
Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?|Huh?
Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go.|Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.|I thought it was $98.50.
Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.|Well, I'm off to Carol's.
Hi, is uh, is Carol here?|No, she's at a faculty meeting.
Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.|What's it look like?
Kinda like a big face without skin.|Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it.
Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.|Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it.
Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.|Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.
The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?|What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?
You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?|Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.
Do you uh, do you talk about me?|Yeah, yeah, all the time.
Really?|But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy.
Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.|Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
Oh, I hate this story.|We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.|We did?
Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?|Yeah, right.
I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.|Get out.
I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.|Really? You don't know what that means to me.
Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?|Nothing.
Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?|Yeah.  Oh.
What's wrong?|I just remembered, I have to do something.
Oh. What?|Um, leave.
So I guess you all saw it.|Saw what?
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.|Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What?|I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.|That's closer.
That's not a question.|But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.|Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
Ah!|Ok, Mom never hit.
What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!|Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
Why would we do that?|Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.|Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
Got the keys? or Got the keys!|Ok.
Anytime you're ready.|Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
Just aim for the bump.|Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.|Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.|Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.|No I don't.
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, "got the keys."|No I didn't. I asked, "got the ke-eys?"
No, no, no, you said, "got the keys".|Do either of you have the keys?
Oh, I gotta get my ticket!|Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.|Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?|Hi, how's it goin?
Shh!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?|I did.
Does it always, uh--?|No, no that was the first.
Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.|I felt it!
Nope, not that one.|Can you go any faster with that?
Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.|Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.|Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
You call that delicious?|Stop it, stop it, stop it!
Ooh.|What?
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.|I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
Shall I carve?|By all means.
Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?|I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.|That's so sweet.
Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.|Oooh!
'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?|No, no, I don't.
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.|That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...|Why don't you just get a roommate?
So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.|Might wanna open with the snowman.
Yeah, you wish!|It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
Oh, oh, good.|Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
|No. No, that's- that's okay.
Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!|That guy's going home with a note!
Could you speak up please?|Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.|Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.|Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
Just a smidge.|David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!|I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.|Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
Nice shoes, huh?|Aah, y'killing me!
...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions.|Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
Yuh.|Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be  yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.|Sure.
Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella.|Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
Rrrreally.|Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
...Now? Now?|Oh yeah, right now.
Okay, okay, okay.|Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
Okay, what the hell, what the hell.  You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?|I can hop.
So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?|I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.|Uh, four.
Four.|Five.
Five.|Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?|Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.|What's the matter?
Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...|That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
Really.|Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
What, uh... what juggling thing?|With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
No.|Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
Hello?|Hey!
Hi.|Hi!  What-what're you doing here?
Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so  congratulations! This is so exciting!|It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
Oh, you're not going?  Oh, why?|Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!'
So-so you're really not going?|I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
Oh don't do that.|Please.
Oh no no.|No, but I'm asking-
Oh, but I can't do that-|No, but I can't-
It's your thing, and-|-make the decision-
Okay, um, stay.|Stay.
Getting so good at that!|It was Max's stuff.
I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow!|You remember Janice.
Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.|Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
Yeah.|Hey, kids...
It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again.|Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter.
I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.|...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?|Why?
Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.|Oh my God.  Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.|He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
We should do something. Whistle.|We are not going to whistle.
Come on, do it.|No!
Do it!|No!
Do it do it do it!|Woo-woo!
Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?|I just wish there was something we could do.  Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
Phoebe, what are you doing?|Maybe nobody's tried this.
I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.|Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!|Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
I wish all guys could be like him.|I know.
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?|He doesn't have anyone.
Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.|No way, forget it.
Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?|Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'|C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
You can say that because she's not your mom.|Oh, please...
Shhh, busy beaming with pride.|...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man...
Now why would she say that's embarrassing?|Shhh.
THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!|Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.|Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...
What about Glen? He could be a Glen.|Nah... not-not special enough.
Ooh! How about Agamemnon?|Waaay too special.
I am famished. What do I want...|Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?|Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.|I know I am.
Who's doing shots?|Yeah.
There y'go. Ross?|Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
Anyone want me to appraise anything?|Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
You okay there, slugger?|Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
What is with you tonight?|Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.|No. It's the one he's licking.
She's supposed to be with you.|You're good.
Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?|The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.|When?
He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.|The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
No, it's you!|Please.
No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...|Right.
You are gonna be fine, believe me.|Uh-oh...
Hey, is Chandler here?|Yeah.
Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?|Right. No big deal.
Okay.|In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
What code?|You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.|Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.|Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.|Ross, how could you let this happen?
I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...|You don't think my mom's sexy?
Well... not in the same way...|I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...|Hey.
Hey.|What're you guys doing out here?
Well, not playing raquetball!|He forgot to leave his grip size!
He didn't get the goggles!|Well,sounds like you two have issues.
Do they wait for me to do this?|So are you gonna tell him?
Why would I tell him?|How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
Oh...|What are you guys doing here?
Hi.|Hi.
What are you doing here?|Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?|No.  No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
How would I know? I-I wasn't here.|Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?!
Oh my God.|You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?|Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
What?|I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
You knew about this?|Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!|Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?|I wasn't- I mean, I-
Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.|I know-
I can't believe you did this.|Chandler-
I'm still mad at you for not telling me.|What are you mad at me for?!
You gotta let me slam the door!|See what happens when you break the code?
Hey.|Hey.
'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.|Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.|Hey Rach.
Hello.|Going to the hospital tonight?
No, you?|No, you?
You just asked me.|Okay, maybe it was a trick question.  Um, Rachel can we do this now?
Alright, whadyou do with him?|Oh! You're awake!
Look at you! How, how do you feel?|Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.
I'm Phoebe Buffay.|I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
Well, we both have.|So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?
Well, actually it's just from me.|I got you the foot massager.
You know who shaved you? That was me.|I read to you.
I sang.  Hah!|Well,... thanks.
You're welcome.|So. I guess I'll see you around.
What, that's it?|"See you around?"
I don't think you mean that.|This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.
Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?|No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
Alright, well, be good, I love you.|You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.|Really stupid.
Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?|Yeah. No. No...
Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.|Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
You're kidding.|No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"
Wow!|Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"
'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"|That makes more sense.
So, what's going on now?|I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!
Whaddya see?|Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
Mrs. Bing.|Mr. Geller.
You mean that?|Yeah, why not.  So I told her.
Yeah? How'd it go?|Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
Well, howdya feel?|Pretty good! I told her.
Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.|What's a 'niffle'?
Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...|Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!|Nooo!
Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna.  Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.|Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?|Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  Hi Daddy!
So, did I hear Poconos?|Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Yeah, that's a big step.|I know...
I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...|Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
Need a new table.|You think?
Hey hey, come on in!|Hey, hello! mmwa!  I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.|I'm pretty sure that it is...
So, I got the results of the amnio today.|Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
Totally and completely healthy!|Oh, that's great, that is great!
Uh, that's our friend Tanya.|
Don't you want to know about the sex?|, yaw...
The sex of the baby, Ross.|Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
Do you want to know?|No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!  Or isn't...
Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...|Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
Mm-hmmm|Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
Well, thanks for the books.|No problem, ok, mmmwa
Hello?|
Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?|That's the rule.
What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!|How'd you get to that?
Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio|You knew about that?
Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.|Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
What do you mean, like, buy it together?|Yeah
You think we're ready for something like that?|Why not?
Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?|Why, are you moving out?
I'm not moving out.|You'd tell me if you were moving out right
Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...|Aw, I know all about Kip!
It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.|Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.|Ok, thanks.
Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum|Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....|And Monica knows...
Pheebs!|Fine!
Oh, right, that's me!|Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
Well, what happened?|Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
Ooooohh!|My God.
Oh yeah, I'm sure.|Was it...?
Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.|Oooooo....
Uma Thurman.|Oh!
She is gonna hate me.|Yeah, well...
Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?|That's patio furniture!
So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!|What about the birds?
I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."|You pick one.
All right, how about the ladybugs?|Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!|Not like that, I won't!
Hey!|Hi Pheebs!
Are you moving out?|No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.
Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?|Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,|Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
Ok, um,|Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies|All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
Which proves that I never lie.|I guess you don't.
So, what do you think?|I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
I know!|So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
Are you okay?|I need some milk.
Ok, I've got milk  Better?|No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!|Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?|I don't know...right, he's the pig!
Such a pig!|Oh, God, he's such a pig,
Oh he's like a...|He's like a big disgusting...
...like a...|...pig...pig man!
Yes, good! Ok...|Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...|Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
The end.|Oh, God...
Should I not have told you?|No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...|We should get over there and see if she's okay.
How's it going?|Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...|Oh, just look at her...
Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...|Oh, you're right.
Hey.|Hey.
You all right?|Ooh, I've been better...
Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.|Oh, Ross...
What?|I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
Huh.|Oh Ross, you're so great!
Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?|Oh...
Yes! And that would be a shut-down!|Shut-out!!
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!|Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  and I'm gone.|One more game?
That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock|I'm sorry!
You have no respect for anybody's privacy!|Rachel, wait, wait.
No, you wait! This is ridiculous!|Can I just say one thing?
What? What?!|That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.|That's pretty much it.
Oops!|But you tell it really well, sweetie.
Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.|Okay. I'll miss you.
Isn't he great?|He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?|So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.|Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?
Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.|Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
Oh, this is my friend Roger.|Hi.
Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now|Did you know this isn't Ma?
Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.|Sure. So how long you been...
Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?|Since then?!
No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?|...I d'know.
Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.|You're one to talk.
Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.|Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A.  That'd be cool.... This blows!|I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
What's the matter with Rog?|Yeah.
Night, you guys.|Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?|Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
I'm Joey Tribbiani.|Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.|Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
That's a good one!|Hey, Joe.
Hi.|Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.|Thank you. Uh...
Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.|I don't want you taking that thing.
Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?|Who-ah-ho.
We'll go to a hotel.|No you won't.
No we won't.|If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
Wow. He's strict.|Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.|C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?|Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
Well, you're gonna.|I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?|Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?|No.
No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."|You really think so?
Yeah. I really do.|Thanks, Chandler.
Hi.|Hi...May I help you?
Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?|Okay...who are you?
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?|Oh, c'mon in.
Thanks.|Hi, I'm Rachel.
Hi.|Bathroom's up there.
Great.|Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
Oh, like, uh, five minutes?|Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time.  Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey, Pheebs.|Hey.
Yeah. Hate him.|We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
...No, we hate him.|We're sorry.
Ma! What're you doing here?|I came to give you this
Oww! Big ring!|Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
Hold on, you-you knew?|Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
So then how could you I mean, how could you?!|Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?|Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
I'm...happy...for you?|Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.|I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.|That's sweet. Could I take her?
What's wrong, sweetie?|Nothing, nothing.
Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.|It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
Oh. They don't.|But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
What?|Intense and creepy.
Oh.|But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.|You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
So you talked to your dad, huh.|Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
How's it going?|Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
Hey, Joey. What's going on?|Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.|She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
You're in!|Aw, right.
Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.|An egg?
Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."|I think it's winning.
Think it'll work?|No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
You can not do this.|Do what, do what?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.|No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.|Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
How do I look?|Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.|No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!|Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.|Which one was Pete Carney?
Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  "Was it good for you?"|Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy.  "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months—I didn't get to win once.
How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!|I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.|Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
Or?|Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.|Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?|I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?|No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Kiss me!|Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Hi, Monica.|Ok, well, this was very special.
This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.|Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to.  He just happened to call.
I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.|That's funny. Who are they?
The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.|You mean they're lovers.
If you wanna put a label on it.|Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.|All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.|Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK.|Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.|Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?|I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.|Hello, funny Valentine.
Hi, Just Janice.|Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
So, um, what do you do for a living?|Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.|I guess.
Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?|Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
What do we got there?|A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture—Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
You're our third call tonight.|Really?
I brought you something.|Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever.
I had them made special.|Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
That's fine.|It is?
Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.|Oh no, you see, actually it is.
No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.|Oh, no I don't.
Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?|I did, but...
You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.|Call me!
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.|You did so. I swear, I swear— How long has she been in the bathroom?
Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.|Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
That could be it.|Oh, god.
Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny|No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
Oh, I love you too. But...|No but, no but.
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.|That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?|So, um, will you bring the truck?
I'll even let you ring the bell.|Oh, my god.
You guys tell them you were married?|No way!
|Thank you.
And a nice hot cider for Monica.|Aww, thank you.  Uh Rach?
Yeah?|Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
Chandler.|Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...|Hey!
Never mind. But it was going to be really good.|What's going on?
So was it a lot more money?|It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve?  Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.|Um... hi there.
Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....|Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
Yeah, yeah!|Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.|Oh my God!
Yeah, I know!  So, what do you think?|Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?|No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the "a-gogo."|Career counselor?
Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.|I don't!
Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.|Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?|So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
Who are you going out with?|Oh, is this the bug lady?
And he's not speaking metaphorically.|huh-huh?
Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...|I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
OK, try this salmon mousse.|Mmmm. Good.
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?|It's creamier.
Yeah, well, is that better?|I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.|Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.|Well.... it is amouz-ing...
|Ten dollars an hour for what?
Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.|Waitressing?
Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...|But, but?
But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.|Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Talk to me.|OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
No no no. Talk... dirty.|Wha... what, here?
Yes...|Ah....
Say something..... hot.|Er.... um.....
What?|Um... uh.... vulva.
Vulva?|Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??|Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.|Please be kidding.
Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.|OK.  I'm in my apartment...
....yeah... what else?|That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Alright, look, I'll start, OK?|Joey, please.
Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.|Wow.
Alright, now you say something.|I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Come on! You like this woman, right?|Yeah.
You want to see her again, right?|Sure.
Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!|OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.|Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
There you go! Keep going. Keep going!|I, er...
Say it... say it!|...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
You're not going to believe this!|It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.|Again?
And again, and again, and again...  And again.|
Well?|Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
Look at this!|Oh! You have a window!
Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...|Oh look! That guy's peeing!
OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.|OK.
|Who was that?
Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.|Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
Ten dollars an hour.|No.
Twelve dollars an hour.|Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour.|Done.
Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?|Hi Steve!
What's up?|In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
What?|Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.|
Let me, let me get you some wine!|Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. ... ginger.
Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?|You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
What a tool!|You don't want to work for a guy like that.
So, er... how did it go with Celia?|Oh, I was unbelievable.
All right, Ross!|I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
Whoa! And the...  huh-huh?|Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
You cuddled.|Yeah, which was nice.
How's this?|Eeeee!
Sorry. How about over here?|Aaaaah!
See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?|No.
What about this?|Aaaaahhh!!
This is unbelievable. It’s been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you’d be looking like a ham right about now.|There’s the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
It’s Phoebe! Hi!|Hi. Okay, will that be all?
Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?|Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now I’m here.
Can we start over?|Yeah. Okay great. I’m gonna be over here.
I don’t know whether he’s testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.|No, yeah, I’ve done that.
And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.|I’ve never done that.
Oh, Pheebs, I’m sorry, I’ve got to go. I’ve got Lamaze class.|Oh, and I’ve got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
No, Susan’s gonna be there too. We’ve got dads, we’ve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.|Well, isn’t, isn’t that gonna be weird?
No, no.  I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I’m pretty comfortable with the whole situation.|Ross, that’s my jacket.
Hi, we’re the Rostins. Err, I’m J.C., and he’s Michael, and we’re having a boy, and a girl.|Good for you. Alrighty, next?
And  to you too, Helen.|Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
Oh, okay. Send her in.|Hi.
Hi, Nina. Come on in.|You wanted to see me?
Uh, Yes. Yes. I’ve just been going over your data here, and little thing, you’ve been post-dating your Friday numbers.|Which is bad, because?
Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.|Your... excuse me?
WENUS.  Weekly Estimated Net...|Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won’t happen again. I wouldn’t want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
It’s not just that she’s cute, okay. It’s just that... she’s really really cute.|It doesn’t matter. You don’t dip your pen in the company ink.
So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?|Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year’s... but obviously someone forgot.
Hey, where you been?|I went back to Riff’s. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
Score.|She is so hot!
Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...|Pheebs?
Hi. Sorry I’m late. Where’s, where’s Carol?|Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I’ll get the information.
No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what’s going on.|Oh, good. This’ll be fun.
Okay, I’m gonna play my sperm card one more time.|Look, I don’t see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I’m a woman.
I see. So what do you propose to do?|I will flip you for it.
Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!|On your back... Mom.
Mr. D, how’s it going, sir?|Ohh, it’s been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
And?|It’s pretty ugly. We haven’t seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
So what does this mean?|Well, we’re gonna be layin’ off people in every department.
Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;|Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
Nina? Nina.  Nina.|Are you okay?
Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don’t hate me.|What?
So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?|Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?|Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
Ooh, okay... good.|What is this place?
I can’t believe you. You still haven’t told that girl she doesn’t have a job yet?|Well, you still haven’t taken down the Christmas lights.
Congratulations, I think you’ve found the world’s thinnest argument.|I’m just trying to find the right moment, you know?
Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.|You’re doing it again.
We’re not doing anything. We’re just sitting around talking, quietly.|I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can’t sleep.
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.|We’ll try to keep it down.
And that’s the Chrysler Building right there.|Nina.
And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.|You’re kidding? She seems so...
Oh, no, no. Nina...  ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.|That’s unbelievable.
And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.|I see. I guess you never really know what’s goin’ on inside a person’s head.
..a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.|Lights please? And that’s having a baby. Next week is our final class.
I’m gonna be a father.|This is just occurring to you?
I always knew I was havin’ a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.|Oh, you’re gonna be great!
Aw, how can you say that? I can’t even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?|You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
Do you have a sec?|Ah, sure, Nina. What’s up?
I don’t know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.|Oh, well, ah... maybe that’s because they’re ah... jealous, of us.
Maybe. But that doesn’t explain why they keep taking my scissors.|Ah, well, maybe that’s, ah, because you’re getting a big raise.
I am?|Sure, why not?
Oh my god!  You’re amazing!|Oh, you don’t know.  Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder’s raise?
What?|Helen drinks.  Will you marry me?
Well, I ended up telling her everything.|Oh, how’d she take it?
Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing.  ..on the desk.|Okay, I think I get how to do this.
You’re not gonna lose him.|Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
Rachel, what are you doing? It’s freezing out here. Would you come back inside?|No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so...
Oh-my-god Rachel!  Rachel!|Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.|Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.|Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
You.|Really?
Yeah.|Oh, that is so sweet.  Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.|you don't have insurance?
Why, how much is this gonna cost?|I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?|Well there's not much we can do.
Um... unless, unless I use yours.|Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my "In case of emergency" person?|That's insurance fraud.
Well, alright, then, forget it.  Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!|Okay, okay. I hate this.
Thank you. Thank you. I love you.|.
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.|That's nice.
No, no, with him.  I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.|Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.|What are you crazy? That's a baby!
Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.|Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?|When's that?
Tonight.|Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
You take your time.|There it is! So what're you gonna do?
Okay, errrr, Monica?|Yes?  ..yes, she is.
Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr.Mitchell.|And I'm his friend, Dr.Rosen.
..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.|Uh, you left out the stupid part.
Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."|I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors,  cute doctors, doctors who are cute!|Alright, what have we learned so far?
Was that the cake?|Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
I hope it's okay.|Oh...
I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"|Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;|Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?|No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?|Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?|No, we can go to Williamsburg.
Rachel, the cute doctors are here.|Okay, coming!
Hi, come on in.|Hey.
Hi, Geoffrey.|Hi.
It's uh...|..well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.|Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?|So?
I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.|I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
Sure, every time, you're such a princess...|You know what?
What?|You know what?
What!?|You know what?
What!!?|Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.|Really?
Why don't you try the hummus?|So, Monica, what do you do?
Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!|And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
I used to wet my bed.|I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
We both do that!|..ah, Rachel, it's your dad.
li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...|Would you excuse me for a second?
...dead!|Ross, he's got the remote again.
It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...|Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do?
Okay  no, you do it.|
What?|We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
Ohhh...  Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.|Thank you.
Okay, let me just change.|Yes.
Hey.|Oh!
Um you, you got a minute?|Um, yeah, I'm just...  ..working.
So.|Uh-huh.
Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.|Oh, wow! You remembered!  Oh! It's a Judy Jetson thermos!
Right, like the kind you...|Right... Oh, I got something for you, too.
How'd you know I was coming?|Um, yeah, um, twin thing.
So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?|Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over.
Does he know?|Who?
Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.|He is? Why?
You got me.|Right.
So, um, are you gonna call him?|What?  Do you think he likes me?
No, Joey.|Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out.  Do you want some chicken?
No. No food with a face.|You have not changed!
Hi, remember us?|Mmm hmmm.
Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.|Well, you know your insurance will cover that.
Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.|Uh-huh.
Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.|Do you have a point?
What's up with the simian?|It's just a fur ball.
Okay...  ..whose turn is it?|Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.|I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!|You go get that animal outta here.
No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.|What's goin' on?
Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!|I'll take a look at him.
Hey.|Urse...
Listen, um...|No, no, no, don't say "listen." I know that "listen." I've said that "listen."
I'm sorry.|I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!|You don't drink.
That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!|Oh, Urse...
Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.|Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?|no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.|Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.|I know...
Really?|Pheebs?
He looks so tiny.|We just got the message.
Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.|We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.|So, you feel like a dad yet?
No, why?|Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
Aqui est�.|�A qui�n pidio el pollo General Tso?
Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here.|Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
Rach, did you proofread these?|Uh... yeah, why?
Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills.|Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?
Hey, guys.|Hey.
Lots of responses.|: OK, read them to me.
|Wow!
Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!|Really.
I mean, that's a typical guy response.|Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?
OK, so now we draw cards.|So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight.
OK Phoebs, how many do you want?|OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs.
OK, so at this point, the dealer...|Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks...
OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson.  Alright babe, deal the cards.|Dammit, dammit, dammit!
Rach, Rach, we gotta settle.|Settle what?
The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so...|The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game.
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.|Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...
Alright boys, let's eat.|Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?
You still on that?|Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : "When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
You are way off, pal.|No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.
Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?|Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive.
Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?|That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand.
Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!|You're kidding! Where? Where?
: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.|Oh, Rachel!
Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!|OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says.  Hi!
No.|I don't think so.
Why?|Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car.
Oh my God!|Really?
Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?|Alright.
So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones.|But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game.
Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen...|Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women.
So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.|Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.
Uh... to the bathroom.|Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?
I want to go to the bathroom.|Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza.
Alright. : Your money's mine, Green.|Your fly is open, Geller.
Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush.|Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it...
Oh, I am very in.|Chandler?
No, not this time.  So... what'd you have?|I'm not telling.
Come on, show them to me.|No..!
Show them to me!|Get your hands out of there! No!
Let me see! Show them!|Y'know, I've had dates like this.
First of all, I'm not losing...|Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing.
Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the...|Hel-lo, Rachel Green.
Mee mee, mee-mee mee.|It's about the job.
I'm in for fifty cents.|Call.
I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit.|Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?
No, I fold.|What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?
I'm in.|How many you want?
One.|Dealer takes two.  What do you bet?
I bet two dollars.|OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.
I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five.|See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse.
: Joey, I'm a little shy.|That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?
Fifteen.|Alright, here's ten.
Thank you.|Good luck.
: OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?|Full house.
You got me.|: Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat.
Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!|Oh, time's up.
Go.|Uh.... bean! Bean!
Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.|Thank you.  Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?|Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
What is it?|Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
Barry who you almost...?|Barry who I almost.
And Mindy, your maid of...?|Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice.  'Bring me the' and- Rach?|What?
Hi.|Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
Really.|No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?|Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.|Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...|Hi.
...Gets interrupted. Hi!|Hi, how was the movie?
Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.|They're still just friends, right?
That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.|Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
I can't believe we are even having this discussion.|I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?|I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.|Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
How could you lose him?|I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?|Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
Whaddyou want?|Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?|No!
I wasn't ready for it.|A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
Saw Regis Philbin once...|Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.|Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?|Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?|Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  Well-
Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.|Okay, quick and painful.
Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.|Oh, what? What-what?
Y'know Marcel?|...Yeah?
I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.|I know, I know, I'm sorry-
No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.|Oh! Who is it?
You called Animal Control?|Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.|O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!|Hi, thanks for coming.
Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.|Turned out it was a hat.
Cat!|Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
My uncle Marcel.|Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
Marcel?|Marcel?
Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...|A monkey.
Yes have you seen any?|No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.|Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.|We can't, alright?  We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.|Marcel?
Marcel?|Marcel?
Oh-my-God!|Whaaat!
Something just brushed up against my right leg!|What is it?
Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.|Look, Phoebe!
Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!|Step aside, ladies!
Yeah, think so. Oh!  Whoah.|Oh gosh.
Marcel?|Marcel?
Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.|Ross, you don't know that.
Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.  And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.|Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!|Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...|Ross.
I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...|Ross.
Oh, forget it, okay?|Ross!
What? What?|Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
Hi, did you order some bananas?|What about it?
Gimme back my monkey.|I don't have a monkey.
Marcel! What've you done to him?|That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.|C'mere, Patti.
C'mere, Marcel.|C'mere, Patti.
Okay, gimme my monkey back.|That's my monkey.
Alright, I want my monkey.|No!
You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.|Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will.  Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.|Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...|Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?|That'd be good.
Alright.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...|Rachel.
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?|Nope.
That's because I'm in front of them.|Eh. I thought that was an alp.
Well, high school was not my favourite time.|I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?|Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.|No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.
I feel violated. And not in a good way.|How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!
I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games...|So have you called her yet?
Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  I'm right, right?|Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine.|Her answer machine?
No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.|So, uh, why didn't you say anything?
Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase "Yes indeedy-o."|Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.|Oh!... Right!
Hey Rach!|How'd it go?
Yes!|Why?
I have my reasons.|Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend?
Wow... Wow!|Yeah.
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.|Nooo, it wasn't.
Oh God!|That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Hey, I've been honing!|What was with the dishes?
Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.|Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
What's the matter?|Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good.
No, it was. It was very very good.|Well, what about Mindy?
Oh, way, way better than Mindy.|No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?
Well, if you want, I'll just—I'll just break it off with her.|No. No-no-no-no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me.
Let's go away this weekend.|Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too..
We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it.|I had a bra.
All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here.|What?!
Can I use your phone?|Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.
Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?|Maybe she never got your message.
Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...|...desperate, needy, pathetic?
Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.|How many beeps?
She answered.|Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.
I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.|Hey! Hi!
If it helps, I could slide over.|It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go.
Hello? Hello?|Oh God. Oh God. Oh God.
So how's Mindy?|Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry...  Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!
Brrrrrrr!|Hell is filled with people like you.
Relax. Y'know, she may not even know.|Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss..
Why don't you just take it with you?|Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Why don't you just call her?|I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Do you?|No!  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back...
Don't you have to pee?|'S'why I'm dancing...
Mindy.|Hey, you.
Hey, you.... So, what's up?|Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
Sure we should... So.|Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer.
Okay.|Will you be my maid of honour?
Of course!|Oh that's so great!
Was that all you wanted to ask me?|That's all!
Ohhhh!!  ...What? What?|That's not all.
Oh sure it is!|Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city.
Um, what- what would make you think that?|Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.
Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too.|Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!
What? What's what you were afraid of?|Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I...kind of... had a little thing on the side.
What?|I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said "Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel," and now I feel so stupid.
Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid.|What do you mean?
Smell familiar?|Oh no.
Oh, I am so sorry.|No me, I am so sorry...
Four letters: "Circle or hoop".|Ring dammit, ring!
Thanks.|Hey, you know our phone's not working?
"Heating device."|Radiator.
Five letters.|Rdtor.
Hey. Got a second?|Sure, sure. Come on...  ...in...
Uh, we are here to break up with you.|Both of you?
Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?|....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Even when we were having sex in that chair?|I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!|You did it twice?
Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.|Okay...
Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.|Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!|Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Oh God.|I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
You okay?|Yeah.
Really?|Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know.
Aww...|Big day.
All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...|You know he's gay?
How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?|I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.|This woman's living my life.
What?|She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
You're not an artist.|Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.|Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...|Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
Nooo...|This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
How about Joey... Pepponi?|No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
Joey... Switzerland?|Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  Which I'm not.
Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?|Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
Well, it does not ring a bell with me...|Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
Might wanna try Joseph.|Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
Hey.|Hey.
What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?|This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.|This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!! ...Thank you.
What d'you think?|Lotsa things.
Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.|You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?|People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
Okay, I'm not getting this!|I'm totally getting it!
Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?|What? You just click when they click.
Great. It's gym class all over again.|Aww.
Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.|It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.|Monana?
Yeah. It's Dutch.|You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.|And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
Hi.|Hey.
At the vet.|She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.|Hey! He beat ya.
She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.|So what does this mean?
I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!|I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
Isn't there any way you can keep him?|No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
How do you get a monkey into a zoo?|I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
Did you call the cops?|Nope. We took her to lunch.
No way. No way did you do this.|Monana was very brave.
Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.|Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.|I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?|Oh, somebody will.
Where exactly is your zoo?|Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
Yes.|Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
No-no, he's, he's very docile.|Even if he were... cornered?
Well I, I don't know. Why?|Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...|How about a hammer, or a small blade?
Why- why- why would he need a blade?|Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!|You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
Yo- hooo!|Where the hell've you been?
Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.|Are you drunk?!
Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.|Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
Water rules!|Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.|Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!|Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.|What?
Hi.|Hey.
How are you?|I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.|That I was not expecting.
I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.|Oh. Thanks.
No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!|Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?|Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
Well, not... worried, just... wondering.|There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
Not necessarily...|Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
Um, I'm not actually Amish.|Really? Then why are you like that?
You by the door. In or out?|In.
You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!|Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.|Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...|That's fine, thank you.
Hello Rachel.|Get off.
Pirates again?|No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this "massage-yourself-at-home-workshop." And they are.
Thanks Joey, that's a good idea.|What... I could, I could do it. What is it?
Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused.  It's a whole big boob story.|I could be a secretary.
Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day.|I could do that.
A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid.|All right, I'll see you guys later.
When we were?|Okay, he's a senior in college.
Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?|No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22.
Can you hear that?|Yeah?
See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.|Oh. Uh, I'm on.
I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.|Will he know what this is in reference to?  All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
What?|Ross says hi.
Ah!|This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Well, now, I actually have to get to work.|Most likely.  Okay, I'm gonna be out there.
Okay.|All right. Bye bye.
Yes?|Whatcha doin'?
Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, gotta change the belt. Did I turn the fish?  Am I out of control?|Just a touch. Mon, I don't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh.
What?|Could tonight be the Night?
I don't know. Look he's a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You don't plan these things.|So, did you shave your legs?
Yeah.|A-ha!
Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesn't mean...|Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time.
All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool.|Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I don't perform those kind of services.
Services?  Oh, services.|All rightie, bye bye.
Hey, hey. How was the first day?|Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice.
Oh... Yeah, you do.|'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
My scones.|'My scones.'
Did not.|I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
How was that possible?|Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there?  Oh, ah. I should go.
Okay.|Okay.
Unless...|What?
Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...|Yeah, I'd really like that.
Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'|Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Ethan?|Yeah?
Are you a virgin?|Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Really?|Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Wow!|You keep saying that.
You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.|Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.|No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Oh.|Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Huh!|But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.|You're not a senior?
Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.|Ok...ay.
What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasn't alive during the Bicentennial.|I just had sex.
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?|Well, you never told me how old you were.
Well, that's different. My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?|I wasn't thinking. I was too busy fallin'...
Don't say it.|...in love with you.
Really?|Sorry.
Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldn't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins.|Who?
Just easier that way.|Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream.
Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there.|No.
You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?|No, it was just the three of us.
Huh!|So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?
Are you not seeing him anymore?|No. You know, sometimes just things doesn't work out.
Oh, yeah.|Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?
It's morphin time!|Stegosaurus!
I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory.|You were great. But they still made fun of you.
What?|You know, now you're more like, you know like, "Mr. Caring Boss," "Mr.", you know, "I'm one of you, Boss," "Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing!"
Then, I don't get it.|Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've gotta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss.
They do?|Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore.
I just wan't to...|No, but you can't.
But I just wa...|Uh uh.
Aren't you gonna...|Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 911, it means she's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it.
That was gonna be my opener.|Hey, did you guys check out those new hand-dryers in the bathroom?
It was.|Then, what's the problem?
Ethan, it's um... it's icky.|Icky? You're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really...|No, don't say it.
...love you.|Are you're hands still wet?
Uh, like, could these margaritas be any stronger?  Hey, Chandler.|Hello, Mr. Bing.
No problem.|You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?
Ross?|I'm here.
You are. Well, um... We, we, we were just...  Wow!|What?  Great, now I'm having a baby.
What?|Ooh, Ooh.
Ross?|I'm hurt.
Monica, let's go. Come on now people, woman in labor.|Hey Ross, look what I've got going here.
What are you doing? We're going to a hospital.|What, so I can't lokk nice? There might be doctors there.
Joey, get out of the fridge.|All right, all right.
What is that?|For the ride.
Save it.|Okay, hating this.
Monica, come on now. Let's go, baby coming.|I can't belive it, I'm gonna be an aunt. I'm gonna have like a nephew.
That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.|All right, I'm going. I'm going.
She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.|I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.|Do we have to know about that?
God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab.|Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction.
She's not even here yet.|What's with the guitar?
Where the hell have you been?|We stopped at the gift shop.
Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys.|I used to have that bumper sticker.
Stopped for a Chunky.|Let it go, Ross.
No.|Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?
Dr. Franzblau, hi.|So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?
59 seconds.  Quartz, ha.|Swiss quartz, ha, ha.
I'll get it.|No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back.
I got it—I'm getting it!|Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips.
I want a baby.|Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.
Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.|Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that.
Thanks, Ross.|Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress.|Did you go home and change?
Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here.  Joey who?|Tribbiani.
Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on.  She wants to talk to you. Take the phone.|Hello?
She's not much of a phone person.|Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no.|Ok, look, maybe I should just go.
Maybe you should.|Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?
Oh, that is so not true.|Oh, it is.
It isn't.|It is.
Breathe.|Breathe.
15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12...|Count faster.
Who the hell is Jordie?|Your son.
No-no-no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie.|Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie.
What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco.|Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp.
I got it.|I got it.
I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps.|No, you don't.
Why?|He started it!
No, you started it.|You did!
But...|Now go!
Thanks a lot.|See what you did.
Yeah, listen...|Out!
Breathe, breathe, breathe...|Oh, no.
It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?|Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?
Please. This is so your fault.|How, how is this my fault?
Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along.|Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along.
You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?|You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
Oh, I'm threatened by you?|Yes.
Yeah, Susan.|Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this.
Help!|I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back.  Ow.
Are they here yet?|No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?
Ok.|Ok?
What're you gonna do, suck the door open?|Help! Help!
Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really.  Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet.|Where have you been?
I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?|No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.|Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.
No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do.|Oh.
I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?|I'm a waitress.
Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'...|Yeah. Gotcha.
I'm gonna go check up on your friend.|Ok. That's fine.
So how did you know I was even here?|Your mom called me. So is this her?
No, this is a loaner.|I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?|Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck.
Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.  This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you.|The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?|You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day.
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.|This is so great.
You wanna explain that?|I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.  I'm sorry, you were fighting.
Where are they?|I'm sure they'll be here soon.
But they're not here yet!|I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them.
Ok, got the vent open.|Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!
Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben.|What do you see?
Phoebs, It's open! It's open!|Wait! You forgot your legs!
Push, push!|We're here!
Good luck!|Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.|How 'bout Ben?
I like Ben.|Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
That's what we were off doing.|Hi.
Thanks.|Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.
Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.|And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this.
No, this is pretty much it.|You guys wanna get some coffee?
All right, I'll see you guys later.|Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.
And here's little Ben nodding off...|Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!
That would be nice.|Pardon?
What kind of research?|Oh, just, y'know.... science.
Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.|... It's a fertility study.
Hey.|Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!
OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns...|We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew...
Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late.|Oh, OK.
Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?|What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Man's got a point.|Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Hey.|Hey.
How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?|I'm going to China.
Jeez, you say one thing, and...|You're going to China?
Oh, let me see!|: Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?
Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh....  Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.|Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.
Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the...|At the coffeehouse, right.
So you do know who he is!  Sorry.|OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.
Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story.|Hi.
Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'|Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
There is a little child inside this man!|Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
I mean, this is unbelievable.|I know. This is really, really huge.
No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?|Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.
Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him.|H-He's in China!
I-I-I don't know.|Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.|Here, look, alright, does this help?
Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later.|Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!
|Alright!
Ni-chou chi-ma!|Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me....
Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you.|What?
It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back.|: Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze.
Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!|Heh, heh. It was nothin'.
Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you!|Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn.
M-Me again?|Sure! Why not?
Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be.|How do you mean?
Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?|I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross.
Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!|Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date.
Another good point.|No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed.
Why isn't it working out?|I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
Is he not cute enough for you?|No!
Does he not make enough money?|No, I'm just....
Is there? Is there someone else?|No! There is.. there is noone else!
Hey, big...|Shhhh!
...spender.|She's still asleep.
So how'd it go?|Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?
The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.|Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!
Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.|It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.
I didn't know you had another level.|I know! Neither did I!
Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?|Yeah.
Oh, from who?|From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?|Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this—this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea.
Oh, why?|Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna...
No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!|Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so...
I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise.|Who is it?
Seven hundred bucks!|Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something.|Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?
I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!|I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!|Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.
Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!|Right! You're right!
Heh... y'know?|You know what?
What?|I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  I mean—I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry.
For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!|Oh, hey, hey, I got that.
Oh my god. Oh my god.|Rach!
Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?|It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
What?|You're bleeding.
I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.|Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
These are, these aren't for you.  Welcome to our country.|Thank you. I'm from New York.
No way!|I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.|'Cause, you know,  if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.|You, you slowpokes!
Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.|Bye.
Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?|Yeah, sure.
Thank you.|Hey, Rach, can I get...
I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?|God?
It was you, pal.|Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.|Well, you owe me one, big guy.
I didn't order lemonade.|Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
But...|Go-go-go-go, come on!  So uh, what did you find out?
Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?|Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
No, although now that's what I'm thinking.|All right, so what were you thinking?
Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?|Ohh! No.
Why not?|Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
No you're not.|I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.|I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it.
You know, I think I was sixteen.|Please, just a little bit off the back.
No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.|What's goin' on?
Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.|Rachel, how did this happen?
I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.|Where?
At his apartment. Is this juice?|Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.|Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?|No, not a problem.
Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.|Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
All right, that's it, I quit.|What? I didn't say anything.
Yeah, but this  is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.|I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.|How who wears it?
Demi Moore.|Demi Moore is not a he.
Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.|That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
Oh.  Oh!|Oh my God!
Oh my God!|Oh my God!
Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?|She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.|I know!
How long do you want the cuffs?|At least as long as I have the pants.
How is she?|It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
I'm okay.|Ooh, that bad, huh?
What?|Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.|You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?|What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
I don't know, I don't know.|Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.|I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Thank you. My hair is very amused.|Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
What's goin' on?|Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?|No. No-no-no-no.
Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually—I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.|Really?
You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?|No, I think that was the whole all.
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?|Oh yeah!  Oh, I can do that.
Really?|You wanna do it right now?
Great!|Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
|Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it.  Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
Rachel, do you have any muffins left?|Yeah, I forget which ones.
Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?|No thanks.
|What a bitch.
Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?|I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Great.|Hi, honey.
Hey Annabelle.|Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
Who?|Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
What's he doin' in my section?|I guess he doesn't know.
Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok?  Hey, how ya doin'?|Mornin'.
Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.|Your territory, huh?
Yeah. Bijan for men?|No thanks.
Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.|What?
We were shopping, and we had lunch.|Oh, all right. What did I have?
You had a salad.|Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.|Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.|Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Ben, dinner!|Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.|What did you just do?
I licked my arm, what?|It's breast milk.
So?|Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
You won't even taste it?|No!
Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?|Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
Hey, where is everybody?|They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.|Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way.
Okay.|Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.|And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.|Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Judy.|Who?
Julie.|What?!
Jody!|You were with Julie?
Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.|Oh. Oh my God.
Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.|Yeah, right.  Sure!
Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!|Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
That is not true!|Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?|Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
Hi, Steve.|Hey!
Howdy.|Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.|Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.|I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?|Yeah I guess you're right.
You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.|I'm gonna do it.
I don't know what else to say.|Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
I feel terrible, I really do.|Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Rachel,  say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?|Yes.
It's that terrible?|Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,  you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.|I love you too.
Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?|I'd do anything for you, you know that.
|Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Mornin'.  I said, mornin'.|I heard ya.
Yeah, I'm ready.|You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?|Sure.
So.|So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.|Really? Me?
Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.|Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Oy.|Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?|Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.|All right, Julie.
Bye.|Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
That's not bad.|Hey.
I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.|You guys are messin' with me, right?
Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.|Hello, Mr. Heckles.
We'll give you Janice.|I miss Janice though. "Hello, Chandler Bing."
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?|Nah. Not really.
You don't believe in evolution?|I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy.
Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?|Yeah, I just don't buy it.
Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity.|Ok, don't get me started on gravity.
You uh, you don't believe in gravity?|Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed.
How can you not believe in evolution?|Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time.|Really? You can actually see it?
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.|See, I didn't know that.
Well, there you go.|Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?
Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?|Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
Please tell me you're joking.|Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.
No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--|What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.
Is there blood coming out of my ears?|Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook.
You remember Janice, right?|Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.
Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.|Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.
It's the only possibility, Phoebe.|Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?
There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.|I can't believe you caved.
What?|You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?
You comin'?|Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.
Hi.|Hi, hi can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?|Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. [leaves flowers on bar]|What? [in surprise she forgets she has the pigeon in the pot and lets it get away]
This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?|Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.
I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.|Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.|Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.|That is wild.
So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?|Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?|[to Monica at the counter] Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
Woah.|Foxy lady.
OK sweetie, I'll see you later.|See you later Rach.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey, c'mon, cut it out.|Hey?
What?|Can I ask you somethin'?
Sure.|Naa.
What? C'mon, talk to me.|OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?|Technically, huh, no.
Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?|No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
No, no no no, don't need to know the details.|It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?|What?
I think it's sexy.|Sexy?
Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.|No kidding?
Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?|What?
I'd wait.|You'd wait?
Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.|Really?
Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.|Women really want this?
Hi.|Phoebe!
Ta-da.|Hey.
Hi.|Ahh, look at you, you look great.
Do I? Thank you, so do you.|Thanks.
Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice.|You always said I'd make it.
Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.|I missed you. [they hug] I'm gonna get changed.
OK.|Um, now. Phoebs.
Oh, right, OK. Ole.|What?
Uh, Julie.|Yeah?
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright.|Hi everyone.
What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.|Pop it in.
So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.|OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.|Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.
Ohh. . .K. How come?|Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
What?|Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
Huuh.|Yeah, I know, I.
I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.|I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
So how long have you known?|Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
And um, and there's actually a, a woman?|Her name's Debra.
Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?|Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
Sure.|But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'|I'm, I'm still me.
You know, it still smells like monkey in there.|That saves us a conversation.
Rachel, that's all we do.|Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? [Rachel gives her a look from hell] That's fine.|OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
So, um, have you told your parents?|No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
[handing him the papers] Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.|I love you Phoebe. [they hug and kiss]
And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.|Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
No Cobb, as in cobb salad.|Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?|Goodnight.
Good morning.|Well, somebody got some last night.
Man, I sure miss Julie.|Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
You ever figure out what that thing's for?|No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
I know.|I'm back.
Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."|I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
Oh my god. You are pure evil.|Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.|Hi, Julie!
Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?|You know, I think I might just.
I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.|Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.|We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.|All right.
Go.|Hi.
Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--|Who is also in charge of purchasing.
Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--|Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--|Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
That's fine, I'll just wait!|Oh, sorry.
Monica!|Are we ready to order?
Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?|Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?|Do I dare ask?
That sounds great. Same for me.|And for the gentleman?
Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.|Um, everyone?
Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.|Thank you.
Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.|Oh, thank you!
So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.|No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.|Not for you.
Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.|Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
I hear ya.|We can talk about that.
I, I just never think of money as an issue.|That's 'cause you have it.
That's a good point.|So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?|Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
G-gift? The thing's not the gift?|No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.|No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.|All of us.
Not at the concert.|Ok.
Whoo!|Cool.
But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?|By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
Come on.|Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
Could you be less enthused?|Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.|Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.|If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
Fine.|Fine.
Chandler!|Yeah?
Geez! Are you ready?|Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
Whoa! You had sex today?|Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
Wow.|Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
Still doing the screening thing?|I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
Bumpy?|Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.|So, let's go.
Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.|Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
Excellent, that was excellent.|I can't believe the guys missed this.
What guys? Oh, yeah.|Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
Ross.|Chandler.
Hey, you guys.|Happy birthday.
Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?|Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.|Yeah, we really missed you guys.
It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.|You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.|What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?|Let me hold him for a sec. There.  Huh? There we are.
Maye it's me.|Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
There's my little boy.|Can I uh see something?
He hates me. My nephew hates me.|Come on, don't do this.
What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?|Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat.
That is so funny. Let me see that.|Are you ok, Ross?
Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi--|Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.|And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god.|Ugh.
Oh my god.|Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
Is your tongue swelling up?|Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital.|Is he gonna be ok?
Yeah, he's just gotta get a shot.|You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?
Jacket now.|What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.|Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?
My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.|No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.
That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?|Ok.
Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!|That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!
Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.|No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring.
That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.|Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?
Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?|Oh.
Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?|Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?
No. But I remember people telling me about it.|I hope Ben has a little sister.
Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.|I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?
That was you?|They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it.
Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying.|Hey, he's not crying.
OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?|So, how was the party?
Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?|No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.
Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?|No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.
Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.|Please.
Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.|Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. [hugs Chandler but holds her hands apart behind his back] Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....
OK, let's do it. [Monica looks at him funny] What?|Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.
C'mon give me five more. Five more.|[weakly] No.
Five more and I'll flash you.|One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them.
Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?|Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.
Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?|No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell.
[to Chandler] Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.|Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.
Hi guys.|Hey.
Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?|Only if you say his full name.
[reluctantly] Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.|Alright.
Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.|Together?
Uh huh.|Both of you?
Yep.|Together.
Hopefully.|Well. [looks at watch] Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. [she leaves carrying her tray then comes back in] OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.
I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.|[distracted] How long do cats live?
[confused] I'm sorry?|Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?
Um, maybe 15, 16 years.|That's just great. [she picks up her champagne and starts drinking]
Um, cheers.|Oh, right, clink. [downs her glass]
Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?|Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.
Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.|I mean he just started going out with her.
Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?|Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.
Alright.|OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?
So, I figured it out.|What?
Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.|Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."
Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet.|Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.
[obviously drunk] I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? [belligerently] What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?|Fruitflies?
So, would you like any dessert?|No! No dessert, just a check, please.
No, no, no, no, no, no [opens door to Monica] No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday.|Why not?
Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.|OK, if you say stop, then we stop.
OK, stop.|No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo [Chandler walks out of the apartment, leaving Monica] Woo.
Hey Rachel.|Ahhhh.
Oh. And how was the date?|Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .
Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?|I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.
OK. Oh, oh, oh. [runs over and picks up the cat toy]|Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
No, I stayed at Julie's last night.|Huh.
Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?|Oh yeah, go ahead. [Rachel walks in her room. Ross picks up the phone and dials his machine to check his messages.]
Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . [jumps the couch and lands on Ross's back, finally getting the phone from him. Ross has a confused expression on his face.]|You're over me?
Ohhhhhhhh God. [climbs off his back]|Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?
Ohh, ohh.|When, when were you... under me? Rachel. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?
Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.|You've had feelings for me?
Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.|Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?
Chandler told me.|Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
When you were in China.|China.
Meeting Julie.|Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?
[doorbell buzzes] That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. [talks on intercom] Hi Julie.|[over intercom] Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.
[perky] I'll be right down.|Wait, so, you're going?
Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.|OK, OK.
Hey Joey.|Hey Phoebs.
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?|I can't find the remote. [Phoebe turns off the TV] Thank you.
So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.|And?
And we did.|All right Phoebs, way to go.
Yay me.|So, so how did it happen?
Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.|And what did he say?
He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.|Wow.
Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.|Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.
Um-hum.|This man is my God.
Hi.|I didn't get a cat.
Oh, that's um, interesting.|No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.
Alright, I got it Ross.|You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
[hurt] What?|I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?|Then you should have said something before I met her.
I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.|There was never a good time.
Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.|Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.
Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?|The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?|Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.|Fine.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.|Good.
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.|No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.
OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.|Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?
Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.|Well, thanks.
I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.|Well, you know.
You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.|[sad] Uh-huh.
And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.|Well no, but um.
I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.|Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .
So, you feel like goin' for a run?|Alright.
Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.|OK. Just for a little while.
Ross kissed me.|Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
It was unbelievable!|Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!
Oh, it ended very well.|Oh.
Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.|Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?
No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair.|Ohhhh.
And, uh, and then I kissed her.|Tongue?
Yeah.|Cool.
All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.|Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
[doggedly] Games and stuff.|[reading the paper] There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
Hi.|Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?
That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful|Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?|You got all that from saline solution?
Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... [Rachel enters, carrying a tray]... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.|[to Ross] Hey, you.
How are you?|Good. How are you?
Hi, honey.|Hi, Julie. [nervous] Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?
Good.|[uncomfortable] Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?
What?|[to Joey] Ssshh.
This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo.|So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.
Mockolate.|I'm sorry?
Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.|Ohh.
Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate.|All right. Mmm-mmm.
Yeah?|[disgusted, trying not to show it] I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that.
No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you.|[still chewing] Mmm-mmm.
But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.|Wow.
Aren't you going to swallow that?|Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
Yeah, isn't that great?|[with false enthusiasm] Mmm.
Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?|Abso...[swallows hard]...lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate.
Really?|Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.
How about Mockolate mousse?|It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.
Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?|What makes it pilgrim?
Hey.|Hey.
Did uh, Ross call?|No, I'm sorry.
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."|No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.
I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare.|Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight.
Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column.|Can't we just use a pen?
No, Amish boy.|Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.
Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?|I don't know.
Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?|[long pause] She's not Rachel.
Oh my god.|Oh my god good?
[to Ross] Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?|Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing.
Hey, do you guys have...[sees Ross, pauses]...hi.|Hi.
[sees his coat on] Where you goin'?|I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.
[dejected] Oh.|No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.
Well, uh.|He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
Oh, god.|Ohhh.
Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good.|I know, I know, it's, it's almost...[turns around, sees Chandler and Joey] What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?
Let me get my coat.|Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.
Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable. [notices Chandler's computer screen] What's that?|[nervous] What? Nothing.
What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?|No, no, see? See? [the printer starts to run] Hey, it's printing. [to Joey, rattled] Hey, it's printing!
Hey, someone order a coat?|Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.
He won't? [remembers what it is] He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?|Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing.
[through gritted teeth] Alright. [clears his throat] "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."|That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?|Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.|Just a waitress?
No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rachel?|Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.|She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.|You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.
Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.|This was your idea?
[squirming] All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.|Yeah. You!
All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?|Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.
Rachel! Whoops! Rachel, hey, open up, please!|[coldly] When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.
I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.|Not interested.
Number six: the way you smell.|[opens the drapes] Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?
Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?|Oh, yeah, I do.
What are you doing out there?|I am, uh, I am...
No.|No?
That's what I said.|Look, maybe we should go?
No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.|Rachel, come on, look, I know how you must feel.
[near tears] No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.|No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.
Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. [to the others] I said don't go!|You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.
Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.|Doesn't matter.
What?|Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.|Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. [hands it to her] Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?
Well, uh, I ate some.|Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?
Hi.|[to Monica] Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.
Look, can, can you do something for me?|Sure, what? Ok, ok. [hangs up the phone] [to Rachel] Music?
Hi, thanks for coming in again.|Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.
It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?|Cat hair.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?|Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
You gave him cookies?|Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
Oh my God.|What?
Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.|Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.|Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
Hey guys.|Hey.
Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. [Rachel is not impressed]. . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. [sings] Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . .|Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? [Rachel walks off] Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?|Yeah.
Hey guys.|Hey.
Um, just some presents.|C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
[childishly] OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.|Cute.
Ross, that is gorgeous!|Yeah?
Hey.|Hey. Hi Phoebe.
Happy Christmas Eve Eve. [sees Ross's picture frame] Oh my God, where did you get this?|Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.|Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.|Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.|How have you never been on Oprah?
[showing her pictures] OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.|Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. [turns to leave]|Oh, wait a minute honey.
Hi, Phoe.|Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
Oh, just updating the phonebook.|Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
[nervously] Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?|Just, you know, to see... um.
Oh, sure, yeah. [gets a box with the pictures] This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation.|OK, is this really my father?
Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.|OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
Look, I. . .|Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.|Oh God.
It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.|Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.|OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
Honey.|[realizes] Oh.
Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. [pulls apart a frame and pulls a picture out] This is the real him.|Oh.
Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.|Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
Hi.|Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
I hope she's OK.|Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
How do you know exactly what she's going through?|She told us.
Just some stuff for the party.|Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?|Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.|Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.|Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .
C'mon Rachel.|OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.|Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. [she walks off and Ross puts his hand to his hair]
Hey.|Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?|Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.|No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.|Whattaya mean?
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.|Wow. Thank you.
Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.|Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! [blows a kiss to a picture of Einstein]
Phoebe here with the cab yet?|Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in.
Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.|Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
Hey, here she comes.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey.
Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.|Eeeshk.
OK, let's go.|OK.
Alright, here, you have to hold this. [hands Chandler a piece of paper]|OK. [reads paper] Brake left, gas right?
Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.|[grabs for seat belt] Where's my seat belt?
Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. [Chandler jumps out of the car]|[Chandler gets in the back seat] Hey!
C'mon, just tell me, please, please.|For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.|Rach, get the heat. [Rachel holds up her hand with wet fingernail polish] Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
Did you just break the radiator?|No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.
I'll call the super.|Here, let me try.
[on phone] Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.|OK, tip the man.
Ooh, this is it, 74. [screeches to a halt, Joey and Chandler are thrown into the plexiglass wall in the cab]|Oh, so that's what this is for.
Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh.|Yeah.
OK, here I go. I'm goin' in.|Alright.
[answers door] Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom.|[sitting at table talking to a girl] It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?
[answering the door] Mr. Treeger.|Uhh, you said there was a party.
Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna.|Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!
Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything.|No, I will not cave.
Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.|No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.|Ross.
No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right.|So, wait, you really did like my cookies?
Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.|Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
[to Rachel who is standing under mistletoe] So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?|Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil.
Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya.|Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil.
OK.|How far'd ya get?
Mailbox.|Alright, we're gettin' closer.
Uh-huh.|Phoebs, what's goin' on?
No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . .|Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.|Well, so why not go knock?
Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.|Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
Yeah?|Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.
You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.|Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!|Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?
Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. [Ross and Phoebe hug, Monica and Rachel hug, Chandler is left standing]|Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.
Rach, these are for you.|Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.|OK, Phoebs, your turn.
Uh-huh.|You guuuyys.
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.|You got me a cola drink?
Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning.|I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.|Yeah.
[sullenly] Hiiiiii.|Are... are you OK?
Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?|Maybe.
Geller!|Hey, Fun Bobby!
Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?|Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!
Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?|Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.
Hey, do you need me to pick you up?|No, I'm alright man. Really.
No, I'm picking you up.|Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me... [Fun Bobby picks Joey up off the ground, bounces him. Joey laughs.] Alright! It still works.
OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? [everyone raises their hands] I'm still gonna go.|OK, I'll see you later babe.
See ya. [exits]|Bye! See you later!
Oooooh.|[realizing what everyone else did a minute ago] Ooooooh.
Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.|Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'
rachel, does this have nonfat milk?|Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.
[takes a sip] Mmmm, no.|Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.
Um, cake.|Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. [Phoebe and Rachel go to counter.]
[comes back to couch, with cake] Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?|I am gonna try and quit drinking.
Hey.|Hey.
Guess who's back in show business.|Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?
No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.|Oh, no.
OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.|Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!
Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.|Hey rachel, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.
Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.|[sounding like Ross] Hhhhiiiii.
Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?|Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday.
Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?|No.
Well, here it is. [She almost smiles.]|OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady...
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?|Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.
What's the matter?|It's Fun Bobby.
What, isn't he sober?|Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.
Alright, here you go, sweetie. [hands Fun Bobby his coffee]|Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
Oh God, yes!|There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?|Oh yeah. See you guys. [leaves]
Oh.... my... God.|It's not that bad.
Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?|OK, OK, don't get all squinky.
But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.|Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.
Hi.|[turning around] Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
Rachel? Um, hi.|Hi.
OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?|Uhh.... waitressing?
Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?|[looks at him] Huh, Bob Saget?
Oh, my, oh!|What? What's wrong?
I, OK....|She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.
I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.|Oh.
Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.|Well, we're not seeing each other, so....
Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...|Well, yeah, this is the deal.
OK, well, um, have a nice evening.|Um, Russ, you ready?
[upset] She's dating. She's dating.|Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?
What do you mean?|Do you not see it?
See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.|Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?
Hey.|Hey.
Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.|Well, the part's mine if I want it.
Oh my God!|Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.
[not knowing how to react] Oh my... God?|Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television.
So, what're you gonna do?|Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?
Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.|I've never slept with someone for a part.
Well is she... [reaches into the cookie jar for a cookie, takes his hand out, covered with pasta sauce]|Sorry.
It's alright. Is she good-looking?|Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast. [pause] You know, after having slept with her.
Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.|I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.
Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?|Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.
Can I get you something from the bar?|Yes, I would like something. [looks at Fun Bobby, changes her mind] No, no thank you.
Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium.|Dysprosium.
You don't see it? You actually don't see it?|What?
OK honey, you're dating Ross.|No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.
Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!|Steve... sleeve!
OK, noone is named Sleeve.|Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.
[to Russ] For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.|You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
Oh you do, do you?|Um-hum, you're jealous.
Of... of what?|You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.|Hey, you listen.
No, no, let me finish.|No, let me finish.
Hi.|Hi.
Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?|No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?
I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?|Me.
Why would I have to sleep with you?|It's my game. You want the job or not?
Hey.|Morning.
What's with all the bottles of liquor?|What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?
Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.|Uh, can I talk to you a minute?
This is really hard for me to say.|Oh God, you fell off the wagon.
Oh, no, no, it's about you.|What about me?
I think you may have a drinking problem.|What these? [holding up liquor bottles] Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.
Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?|Oh... shoot.
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.|OK.
Take care.|You too.
What happened?|Well we... we kinda broke up.
[holding bottles] Does anybody want these?|I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
Hey.|Hey!
It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.|So what'd you do?
Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.|Good for you.
But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.|So... and?
Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!|Allright!
Hi.|Oh, hey.
I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.|Yeah, I'm sorry man.
Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.|Oh.
Hey.|Hey!
Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!|So how did everything go?
Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it.|Well, we've gotta go.
Ok.|[clears her throat]
Oh, you and me?|Uh, no, Susan and me.
Ok.|We're uh, we're getting married.
As in, "I now pronounce you wife and wife" married?|Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.|Look I just thought that...
No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!|Is your finger caught in that chair?
Mmm hmmm.|Want us to go?
This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.|It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..
Would it matter?|Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!
I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?|They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.
If you wanna call that a reason.|[singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.
Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.|Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.
Excellent!|For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
That is so good! Do it again!|All right, all right. "Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"
No no, that's me.|Oh, yeah.
Oh, hello.|Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...
Is everything ok?|Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.
Oh my god.|That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.|Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.
Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.|Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.
[laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.|I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?
I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.|For...me.
Well, not just for you.|Well, what do you mean?
I'm uh, considering leaving your father.|[entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.
Look at this.|These are from Halloween three years ago.
Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?|No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.
This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?|God!
That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?|Oh! What's new in sex?
The only man I've ever been with is your father.|I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.
I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.|Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?
No.|You want me to talk you out of it?
I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.|Why on earth would I understand this?
You didn't marry your Barry. I did.|Oh.
Hi.|How's it going?
It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]|Fine, whatever.
You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.|Carol, what's the matter? What happened?
So we're back on?|We're back on.
It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.|Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.
Thank you.|Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]
Ross. [He lets her go]|You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.
Would you look at them?|Yeah, can't help but.
[to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]|Hey, Mom? Having fun?
How you doin'?|Ok.
You did a good thing today.|Yeah.
You wanna dance?|No, that's fine.
Come on. I'll let you lead.|Ok.
Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?|Well, Mon, I was married.
All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.|I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler]
That commercial always makes me so sad.|Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.|I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.
Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.|Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.|Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.|Rhythm?
No, my first fan mail.|Alright!
Hey guys.|Hey.
Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.|You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.|Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.
I know, I know. [to Rob] Hello.|Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
Hi Rob Dohnen.|I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.
Oh, wow.|Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?|Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. [both laugh hysterically]
Hello.|It's Erica.
[Joey grabs a frying pan] Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.|Let's get out of here.
The one time they're not home.|OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.|She's comin'.
It's me.|Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?
Hi.|Erica.
Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.|Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.|Oh my God, what happened?
Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.|I can't believe this.
I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.|Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.|Zoo dollars?
Ooohhh.|I know.
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?|Yeah it is. . . what?
Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.|Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites.
Who's they?|No one.
Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't.|Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. [laughs hysterically]
No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?|Alright, just one. [she licks his hands rather emphatically] Wow, you're good at that.
Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?|Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.|Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?
I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?|Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.
No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?|But that's what...
I should just be happy to be near you.|Hey I- [she cuts him off with a kiss]
Hey what?|That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! [she starts nibbling his hand] Hey. He-hey.
[singing] There'll be times when you get older|Excellent!
Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.|That was great, the kids loved you.
Yay, I rock.|And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.
But.|How did you know there was a but?
I sense these things. It was either but or butter.|The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
I can do that.|Really?
Yeah.|Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.|Buddy, my monkey?
Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.|Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?|That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.
Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?|That guy Lipson?
Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?|No, I, I only know Lipson.
Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...|Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.
Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.|Of course.
Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.|This is unbelievable.
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?|Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
Maybe.|But you already told me everything.
Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.|Well, so what're you gonna do?
Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.|That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
You're the only one who can save her Drake.|Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God.
It's Erica.|Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.
How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?|Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?
Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?|Who?
Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.|It's not what you think, that was...
You told me I was the only one. [throws a glass of water in his face]|Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.
Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?|Somebody wanna help me out here?
How, how can you be here and there.|'Cause it's a television show.
Drake, what're you getting at?|I'm not Drake.
Is this true?|Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. [throws water in his face]
Is all this true?|Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.
Oh Hans. [They kiss]|Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
I'll never forget you Hans. [Joey shuts the door in her face]|OK, alright, the people who threw the water.
Fired! Why?|The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?|No.
I see.|Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?|I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan.|You're kidding.
I know.|I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?|Um, yeah I guess that's me.
This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.|What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?
Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?|I'm sorry guys, closed set.
Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.|Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.
Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...|Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. [guard lets them in]
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.|What what what what?
Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot.|Ya think?
The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?|No, was he any good in it?
Rachel, he like, totally changed time.|Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?
Oh, yeah.|What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?
He could hear me.|OK, I'm doin' it for ya.
Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.|Excuse me. Hi.
No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.|OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?
Oh that's me, I gotta go.|Oh uh, o, OK.
Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.|Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.
I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.|No one was around to hear that?
So what'd he say?|Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.
Well, thanks anyway.|He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking.
Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...|Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.
And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.|Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh.
Does anybody need anything?|Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.
That is so unfair.|I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.
Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.|You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday.|Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.
Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.|Stick a fork what?
Like, when you're cooking a steak.|Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.
Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?|Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.
I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'|What did you say?
Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?|Oh, you just know.
Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.|Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops.
But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?|Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.
Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.|You want me to wear your panties?
Could ya?|Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell.
OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake.|Oooh.
With mealworms.|Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?
OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first.|Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. [Monica starts making faces behind her back] She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?
Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share...|Ya know, you had no right to go out with him.
Ow. Ow. Ow.|Alright, now I will let go if you both stop.
Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.|Forget about it.
C'mon.|I can't believe we're doing this.
Alright mister, let's see those panties.|Alrighty. [we see Chandler's pants drop from under the stall door]
Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?|What?
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.|Oh.
Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.|OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials.
C'mon hurry, hurry.|Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?
Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind.|OK.
Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video.|Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie.
This is for the fourth grade.|Huh? Where, whaddya mean?
Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean.|What, what's what you mean?
My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18.|That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this. [she leaves with his clothes]|Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.
I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? [he nods] Can you beat up that guy?|Sure.
This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.|Normally, I would not do it.
Well, what made you make the exception for me?|'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and...
Say you're sorry.|No. [hitting each other]
Say it.|No. [hitting again]
Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.|OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater.
Say you're sorry.|OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play. [She grabs a jar of tomato sauce and Monica's purse]
What're you gonna do?|You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
You don't have the guts.|Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute.
Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves.|I'll help you fix your sweater.
Joey?|Ma?
Joey!|Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off.
Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes.|Are you naked in there?
Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.|Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?
No, no, this is the first time.|Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.
I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them.|Well, let me see.
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.|Alright, alright. [climbs up in the next stall and looks over at Chandler] Woah, someone's flossing.
[to Joey who's looking over a toilet stall] Joey, some people don't like that.|Chandler's wearing panties.
What? Let me see. [climbs up in the other adjoining stall]|No, no, you don't have to see.
Hi Tushie.|Alright, one of you give me your underpants.
Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?|I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on.
Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie.|What happened?
One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye.|Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right.
[to Rachel] I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me, [to Monica] or you and me. Drew was very disappointed.|OK, well, bye. [kisses him]
Goodbye.|Well, bye for me too. [kisses him]
Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .|Oh, no no no no no.
Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt.|No no no no.
You know, I think I want to write a song about all this.|Oh yeah.
Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?|How long you been waitin' to say that?
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dying.|Aaaaagggghhhhh.
Can't you see what's going on here, this man is dead.|For this episode, I'm using italics to signify portions contained in the prom video.
Hey.|Hey. Hold on a second. [shoots a goal] Huh?
Nice, nice. Hey I got somethin' for you. [hands Chandler an envelope.|What's this?
Eight hundred and twelve bucks.|Well, I don't know what Big Leon told ya but it's an even thousand if you want me for the whole night. What is this for?
Well, I'm makin money now and this is payin' you back for head shots, electric bills, and so many slices of pizza I can't even count. I love ya man.|Well, thanks man. Now I can get my pony.
Hey, this is a little extra somethin' for uh, ya know, always bein' there for me. [hands Chandler a jewelry box]|Wow, I don't know what to say. [opens the box and pulls out an incredibly gaudy gold bracelet] Wow, I, I don't know what to say.
Heh, what d'ya say?|I don't know. It's a bracelet.
Isn't it? And it's engraved too, check it out.|[reads] To my best bud. [puts it back in the case] Thanks best bud.
Put it on.|Oh, now? [puts it in his desk drawer] No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion. [sets a chair in front of the drawer]
Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. [gets the bracelet from the drawer] You put this on, you're good to go. [puts the bracelet on Chandler] Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet.|I so am.
You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?|Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track.
Well, this all looks good.|Great.
And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?|Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing.
Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad.|A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like.
No, just a salad will be fine.|You got it.
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.|Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.
Uh-huh. Is it dirty?|Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.
Don't, I like it dirty.|That's your call.
So, uh, what are you going to do next?|Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.
Are they, uh, firm?|They'r alright.
You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?|No really, they're OK.
You gonna slice them up real nice?|Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.
Aaaahhhhhhh.|I'm outa here. [Monica leaves]
Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?|Oh, some guy she met at the movies.
Oh really? What uh, what does he want with her?|Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance. . . ya know, make a little love. . . well pretty much get down tonight.
[puts the message in the cupboard] I don't know, I don't get, I don't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, she meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service.|Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
Wha, OK, now how do you know that?|Because she's your lobster.
Hey, you feelin' better?|Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
Ya know, the man's got a point. [gestures with his arm and the bracelet falls off]|What is that sparkly thing?
That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.|No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.
Hi.|Hi.
So, what's this.|Some of your old stuff.
Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?|Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
Oh, hi Rachel.|Hi.
Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.|Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
Do you want a refill?|No, I'm alright, thanks.
OK. Ooh, OK, you gotta give me a second, I wanna get this just right. [she sticks out her gut, clears her throat and sniffs her nose and then in her best male voice. . .] Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now.|[walks over to the woman] I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.
It's not that bad.|Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]
Chandler, Chandler.|I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . . [turns around and sees Joey] Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. [Joey turns around and walks out without saying anything] That's actually good.
Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha.|I think she's OK.
[Rachel, laughing, puts a hand on the guy's shoulder] Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something. [walks up in the middle of their conversation] Excuse me, are you Rachel?|What?
I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow.|What are you, what are you doin'?
Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids.|Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care.
OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. [man leaves] You're welcome.|What?
I was saving you.|Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?
Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . .|OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save.
But, you are.|What?
Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster.|OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?
No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?|Do the claws again.
Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?|Ross, there is no us, OK.
No, but. . .|No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.
Well, but, but. . .|NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that.
E-except, except that what?|No, no, ACC-cept that.
Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? [Joey doesn't respond] Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? [Throws a basketball to Joey. Joey doesn't move to catch it and the ball takes out a lamp] OK, that's my bad.|If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?|Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that. [Joey goes to his room and shuts the door] Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . . [notices the bracelet is missing from his wrist] wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. [he starts searching the room, lifting up the couch cushions]|You know what the. . . [sees Chandler on his knees, holding the couch cushions]
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.|Hey guys.
A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.|Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up. [the Gellers return to watching TV and Ross goes over to Monica]
Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?|In the bank.
There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. [pulls a quarter from behind her ear]|Anything larger back there?
I can't believe it.|Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. [sits down at the bar]|[comes up from behind the bar and startles Chandler] Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? [holds up Chandler's bracelet]
What am I gonna do, huh? [Joey walks in behind him]|Hey.
Hey.|How come you have two?
Well this one's for you.|Get out.
No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, [puts bracelet on Joey] it's about you and me and the fact that we're [reading bracelet] best buds.|Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.|You have dinosaur checks?
Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?|Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful.
[Rachel enters] Oh.|Hi.
Hi.|Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this. [Rachel enters with a huge nose]
You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.|Oh yeah we do. C'mon.
You look pretty tonight.|Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?
Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.|[the shoulders of her dress keep falling off her shoulders] Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down, I can't. . .
Uh, hold, let me see, I don't know. So what're you gonna do. . . [doorbell rings]|Oh, the guys are here.
this summer?|Work on your music?
Oh my God, look there's Roy Gublik.|Ya know, Roy saw Star Wars 317 times. His name was in the paper.
Where's Chip, why isn't he here yet?|He'll be here OK, take a chill pill. [Chip pins Monica's corsage on, Monica then turns and whispers to Rachel]
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.|If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh.|OK. Hold my board.
Dance with him.|Mom, I'm hungry.
Dance with your father.|I may not know any of your flash dances but I'm no slouch on the dance floor.
Oh, Jack.|Oh, Judy. Oh, Judy.
Alright, no peeking. No peeking, no peeking, no peeking.|Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.
Alright open your eyes. [opens his eyes to see two black leather recliners and a big screen TV]|Sweet mother of all that is good and pure.
Huh? Days of our Lives picked up my option.|Congratulations!
I know.|Now we can finally watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.
Uh-huh.|So uh, which one is mine?
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want. [Chandler starts to sit in one of the chairs] Not that one.|[sits down] Ohh yes.
[sits down] Ohh yeah, that's the stuff.|[reaches for the footrest lever] Do we dare?
We dare.|[both extend the footrests] Aaahhhh. [both recline their chairs] AAAAHHHHHH.
I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.|Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.
Hi you guys.|Hey.
Hey you.|Hey you. [they stand together in front of the TV.]
So, uh, how was your day?|Oh you know, pretty much the usual, uh, sun shining, birds chirping.
Really? Mine too.|Hey cool, mine too.
OK. [they go to kiss but everyone's watching so Ross just kisses her on the top of her head and leaves]|Bye guys.
It is our first official date. Our first date.|Uh, hello.
Hi.|Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you?
God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.|Yes but my mom got me this job.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.|Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.
It's James Bond.|Sorry we're late.
Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.|What if we have to pee?
You've got to get back out there, it's your party.|But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
You're an opthamologist.|Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.|OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. [grabbing some wine glasses and opening the door to the party] Who needs glasses? [everyone laughs]
I am not.|Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.|So. You two are totally into each other.
Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.|OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.|Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow.|I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
Monica.|It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
Honey, I'm just checking.|Oh.
Monica.|Mon.
What, what.|I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry.
And that's, that's funny why?|Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.|OK. [start kissing again and Rachel starts lauging again]
OK, my hands were no where near your butt.|I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.|Just one cheek.
Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.|Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them.
That's romantic.|C'mon touch it.
No.|Oh, come on squeeze it.
Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.|You got a Cheeto on your face man.[Joey removes the Cheeto and eats it]
Hi.|Hey.
What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?|That was 14 hours ago.
She laughed at you?|Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?
Hi you guys.|Hey.
Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . .|Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.
OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you.|No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?
Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert.|Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect.
What's this.|Could you get us a couple of beers?
I'm going to look into your eyes now.|Really.
Yeah, that's my job. Alright, look up. . . look down, now open your eyes, now look down. That's right, look into the light. Now look at me. . . OK. Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.|Good, they feel good, in my head.
So, it's great to see ya.|You too.
You too.|OK, um. Goodbye.
Drops!|What?
Drops. Here, they're free.|Thanks. So, I guess I better be going.
Oh, OK, yeah. I'll see ya later.|Thanks again.
We have got to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.|Hey, woah, hey, woah.
You know you should go outside and be with the three-dimensional people.|No, inside good, outside bad.
You guys are so pathetic, I, oh, OH, XANADU! OH.|She's one of us now.
Hi you guys.|Hey.
Alright you guys, I'm takin' off my shirt.|[uses a dentist mirror to see] Naa, she's lyin'.
Stop sending food to our apartment.|Well, why're you all dressed up?
No one.|C'mon, what's his name?
Nothing.|Come on, tell me.
Alright, but I'm very excited about this OK, so you gotta promise you won't get all big-brothery and judgmental.|Oh, I promise, what.
It's Richard Burke.|Who's Richard Burke? Doc, Doctor Burke? You have a date with Doctor Burke? Why, why, why should that bother me? I, I love that man, he's like a uh, brother to dad.
Well for your information he happens to be one of the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest men I've ever been with.|Doctor Burke is sexy?
When?|When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here. [points to the tip of her nose]
Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, homo-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner.|It's OK, it's fine.
Wow, is that Michelle?|Yep.
I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional.|Ya know, she's having another baby.
I thought she just had one.|No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . .
Oh, you're a grandpa.|Yeah. Are we nuts here?
I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.|I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.
Yeah.|So.
So maybe we should just. . .|Yeah, yeah, maybe.
Wow, this really sucks.|Yeah, it sure does. [they hug and it turns into a passionate kiss]
Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?|No, no, there's no rush or anything.
Pizza delivery.|Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys.
Rach.|Oh.
I'm done.|Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's.
Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else.|No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?
No, no, we won't.|We won't?
[grabs a fur pelt] C'mon.|OK, that's dead right?
What is this? What are we doing?|Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
Grape.|[spreads the pelt on the floor] OK, now, sit. OK. [he starts the music system]
Sorry.|Ah, so what are we looking at?
Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major.|Really?
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.|Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. [they kiss]
You're not laughing.|This time it's not so funny.
Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.|What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
Hi.|Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.|What?
Is that the fire alarm?|Yeah. [feels the floor] Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time.
Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?|That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.
Waaa-aaah.|What?
The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.|Yeah, so.
Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. [Joey gets a sheepish look] You used my toothbrush?|Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.|Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.|Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
Hey.|Hey.
Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?|Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?|So where you gettin' it?
Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?|Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
Alright, shall we?|OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. [opens door] We're here.|Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
Hi ma.|Happy birthday.
Well, you kids take the train in?|No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. [Monica sprays whipped cream all over the place]|Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
Can you believe this place?|I know, this is a great apartment.
Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.|Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.|Thanks. You want it?
Huh?|Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?|Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
C'mon, tell us.|Yeah, is she really 20.
C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.|Dad, you really don't want to do that.
Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?|Jack, would you let it go?
Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.|Guys. Seriously, it is not like that.
Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .|Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?|Well I. . .
I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.|Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
Here we go.|[reluctantly] Uh-huh.
You're not going?|Uh-huh.
What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?|No. Well, yeah, maybe.
I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?|What's 1922?
Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?|Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?|No.
OK, who is the boss of you?!!|You?
How ya doin'?|I'm a twinkie.
Really? I'm a hero.|Oh, this is so hard.
Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.|Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
My parents are dead.|God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.|Alright.
[walks out of the bathroom and runs into Mrs. Geller who is going to the bathroom] Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you.|Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.|I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.|I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.|Really.
I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.|So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.|[they start kissing] Oh Jack stop.
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.|Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.|Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.|What?
I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.|Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.|Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
Well that's how I feel.|Well then maybe you should take it.
Well then maybe I will.|Fine with me.
Who's drink can I freshen?|Almost time for cake.
Hey there.|What?
Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.|Humm, really?
Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?|Uhh, not that I know of.
Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?|That - that's an idea.
Oh?|Oh?
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?|Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
So, who's the mystery man?|Well, uh, he's a doctor.
A real doctor?|No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. [she puts her arm around Richard]
Well that's wonderful. . . I|Mom, it's OK.
Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!|[enters with his bat] Found it.
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.|That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
Oh please, a relationship.|Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.|I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.|Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
Oh OK. [pulls over her shirt and shows a bare shoulder] Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.|You didn't get it?
No.|Why didn't you get it?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.|Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?|Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
Hey.|Hey.
Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .|Yeah me too.
I know. Yeah.|Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
No, we're alright.|So I got ya something. [tosses Joey a bag of plastic spoons]
Plastic spoons. Great.|Lick away my man.
These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.|What?
Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.|No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
I'm movin' out like we talked about.|Well I didn't think that was serious. [grabs the spoons back] Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.|Well, there you go.
Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.|Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?|I did pay for half of it.
Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.|Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.|Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
So, are you sorry that I told them?|No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
Oh.|Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
Is Ross here?|No he went out to get pizza.
Oh really, OK. [shows Monica her tattoo]|That's great.
What? You didn't get one.|OK, well then what is this? [shows her bare shoulder]
That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.|OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. [she bends over and bears her tattoo right when Ross returns]|You got a tattoo?
Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.|Lemme see. [looks]
Well?|Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
Really?|Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
I guess.|Hey, save us some pizza. [they go off to Rachel's room]
Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.|Stop talkin' to your men. [Joey scores]
Yes! And the table is mine.|Congratulations. [Chandler leaves]
Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?|Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . [Chandler gives him a look] except when we are here.
Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.|[quietly] Yeah, I remember.
So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?|Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
Thanks.|So, I guess this is it.
Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.|Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house.
Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care.|Yeah.
Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.|Get out.
Art.|Art it is.
Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee.|Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge.
Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?|Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing.
Right, I go-, I got it.|So why don't ya show us the rest of your casa?
Yeah. Uh, oh, OH, the best part, c'mon. [leads them to the bathroom, gestures towards toilet, everyone stares, uncomprehending] Heh?|Hey, nice toilet.
No no no, behind it.|Wha-, you have a phone in here?
That's right, I have a phone in here.|Joey, promise me something.
Yeah.|Never call me from that phone.
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered.|Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.
Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK.|OK.
OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat.|[congradulating her and celebrating]
I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video.|[celebrating more]
I'm done now.|[celebrating]
Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood.|Get the what?
What're you doing?|I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7. [swats at an imaginary insect by his head, guy leaves promptly]
Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom.|Calm down, I'm blow drying.
Blow drying what, you have no hair.|What's goin' on?
Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again .|Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now.
GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!|Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue.
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.|[in a childish voice] I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.
Shut up.|[childish voice] Shut up.
Cut it out.|[childish voice] Mi-mi-mii.
Hello.|Hey.
Hey!|Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today.
Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing.|Yeah well, I hear the place looks great.
Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'|Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest.
Oh, well great.|Yeah I just... wanted to call and say hey.
Well OK then. [oven timer goes off behind Chandler] Was that the oven timer?|That's right my friend. It's time for...
Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?|I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe.|Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?
Hey, hey, they're runnin'|See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind.
But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.|I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.
I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.|But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together.
Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated.|Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too.
OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?|OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers start singing smelly, smelly, smelly, smelly behind her] Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?
They're your backup singers... beind you.|OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know.
Alrighty. From the top.|OK. [singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat [back up singers - smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad smelly cat, it's not your fault] OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat.
Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here.|Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go.
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah. [Monica comes out of her room] Oh, were you takin' a nap?|I was.
Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line. [gets the other line] Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks. [hangs up the other line] Call Joanna. [back on with Tony] Hi.|Did she leave a number?
Did you see me write one down?|I don't have her number, butt-munch.
Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby.|I'm not a baby, you're the baby.
Look, you wanna get off my back?|You wanna get out of my face?
Wait hold on Tony, hold on. [answers second line] Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on. [gets first line] Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend.|Give me that.
OK.|Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom. [she starts throwing oranges at Ross who's looking pleased with himself]
Hey.|So uhh, how's the palace?
You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?|Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news.
Likewise. Uh, I'll take that. [grabs moose hat] It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?|At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo.
Wow.|Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room.

It's my TV.|Wha-, oh, quit it.
Bite me.|Oh my God.
Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me.|Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy. [goes in the bathroom]
OK, what're we gonna do about this?|Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight.
Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here.|Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright.
I just can't stand you being here all the time.|Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun.
Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?|Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids.
Ross, I hated you when we were kids.|You hated me when we were kids?
Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts.|Why did you hate me?
Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way.|And that wasn't fun for you?
Duh-huh!|I can't believe you hated me.
Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.|Really?
Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.|I can do that.
Then I won't have to kill you.|So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?
Yeah, thanks. You know what?|What?
If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can.|Ohh... OK. [changes the channel]
Hey.|Hey.
Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video.|No.
Yes.|Well, how did you find out?
Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue.|So what're you gonna do?
Well, I can't work with people who would do this.|Sure.
I mean this poor woman.|What woman?
The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video.|OK, Phoebs. But what about you?
Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?|No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports.
[stares in disbeliefe] Yeah o-, OK, alright. [oven timer goes off] Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch.|Y-, y-, you like that show?
You don't like that show?|Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know.
Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.|I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.
[singing] Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody.|Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault.
Monica.|[sings] They won't take you to the vet.
Chandler.|[reluctantly sings] You're obviously not their favorite pet.
Rachel.|[sings] And you're no friend to those with noses.
Oh Drake.|I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?|We, we just wanna see the end.
So what happens next?|Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
Phoebs, play with meeee.|No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.|Why don't you play with your roommate?
Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.|Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.|Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
We don't need to remedy that.|Oh yeah, it'll be fun. [throws a tennis ball at Eddie's bedroom door]
That was so lame.|I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. [leaves]
That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?|What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...|Well it's not Sean Penn.
And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night.|Phoebe's got another job, right?
I know.|Well, we should probably get going.
Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.|Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
Ok.|Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
Hi.|Hi.
I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.|Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
Thanks.|Oh, oh, c'mon in.
I'm Tilly.|Oh.
I gather by that oh that he told you about me.|Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
He's kind of intense huh?|Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.|That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.|Bye-bye.
So, we gettin' a fish?|You had sex with her didn't you?
Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.|Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
Page 42, page 42, page 42.|Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
Ooh, I look good.|Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'|Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?|Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.|Right. Could you sign this?
No. No way, I'm not signing that.|I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
How can they do this to me?|Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.|Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.|Two.
Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?|Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. [goes in the bathroom]|Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.|Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
Uhhhooo.|C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
Well, there's you.|Better not be doin' these in order.
Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.|Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.|Really?
Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.|That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.|Where's Buddy?
Buddy?|My fish, Buddy.
There was no fish when she dropped it off.|Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?|Well yeah.
Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.|You really ok with it?
Oh honey, I'm fine.|Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
What? Alright, what about my two?|Well, it just seems like a really small number.
Right, and...|And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.|But you've only slept with two people.
Right.|Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.|Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...|Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.|Knock-knock.
But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.|Until now. [jumps on Rachel on the bed]
Oh, hi.|Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
Oh my God, honey that's great.|I know. I just can't find...
Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.|You need one too?
There's only one.|Monica.
Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. [shuts the bathroom door]|[comes out of the bedroom] Rachel. [growls then sees Richard standing there] Hey.
No.|Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.|Agghhh.
Yeah.|One two three. [Rachel picks rock, Monica picks scissors]
Fine, go have sex.|No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.|Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.|Why?
Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.|Why would you kill his fish?
Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.|Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? [they turn on the TV]
Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.|Oh good.
C'mon.|Joey.
Open up. We want to talk to you.|I don't feel like talkin.
Sorry Joey [runs to the bathroom]|Hey.
Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.|It's gonna be ok. You know that?
Uhhhaahh.|Pecan sandy, just made em.
Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?|Uh, sure, why not.
[throws it across the room while Eddie's not looking] Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?|I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
[looks in the fish bowl to see a fish cracker] Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.|What's you point man?
Hey.|Hey.
Oh man.|Let's never speak of this.
Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?|Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep.
Why?|Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please.
I can't sleep now.|You want me to sing?
No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now.|Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man.
Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.|No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?
I didn't realize that.|Yeah.
GET OUT NOW!!|Ok, you really want me out?
Yes please.|Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out.
I want you out.|No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips.
Where did you hear it from before?|Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.
Hey.|Hey.
Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?|A mirror?
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.|Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood.
Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache.|Cache? Jaunty?
Hey.|Hey.
Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?|Oh my God, it was incredible.
Didn't it like totally speak to you?|Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?
Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it.|Men just take out wind?
Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers.|Wow.
Yeah.|Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit.
Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind.|No.
No, 'cause he's yummy.|Yes. But all the other ones.
Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip.|Anybody want a croan.
Don't worry about it already. Things happen.|So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?
Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?|No, can we get back to me?
Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World.|Alright. Cab driver number two?
You're welcome.|But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
Things change, roll with em.|But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.
Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.|I'm sorry. See ya.
Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so.|Isn't it.
Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'.|I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
NO!|No?
No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?|Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind.|You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?|You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that.
Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry.|Um-um, um-um.
What is it?|I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it.
See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh.|What, what's that?
It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.|Open it, open in.
Oh my God.|Woah.
Look at this, how did I spend so much money?|Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due.
Ahh.|What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?
My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do.|Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
What?|That audition.
That's a two line part.|Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite.
So what.|So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money.
Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic.|Toilet paper?
Yeah.|Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic.
Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend.|I am your friend.
Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'|But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe.|Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another.
Look, I don't wanna hear this right now.|Huh, I'm just saying...
Well don't just say.|Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go.
Ok.|Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok.
Hey pal.|Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!|Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?
Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one.|Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?
Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!|Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?|Your last roommate's kidney?
Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go.|Lemonade? You ok man?
Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show.|Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?
I fell down an elevator shaft.|That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
What?|I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
Daaahhhh!|Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching.|I wa-
Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons.|Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
What?|You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!
You, you want, you want me to move out?|Uh-huh.
I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?|This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue.
Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. [walks out the door and after a pause comes back in] But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!|You want some help.
All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks.|Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.
What?|Five oh dollars.
Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything.|That's great.
And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting.|Ok, listen, thanks for coming in.
Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.|And I would have to say pah-huh.
What?|Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.|Who?
Paul.|Oh.
Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.|Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose.|[enters] Oh my God, what's goin' on?
They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.|No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey.
Thanks Ross.|Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
I went.|Great, how did it go?
I didn't get it.|Good for you.
What?|You're livin' the dream.
Huh?|All right then.
[movers removing a glass parrot] Oh, not my parrot.|What?
I can't watch this.|[approaching the mover holding the parrot] Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?
Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register.|Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?
Here are your cakes.|We didn't order cake.
No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other.|You're right.
You know.|I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
Thank you. So are we good?|We're good.
We're good?|Yeah.
Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck.|[enters] Ding dong, the psycho's gone.
May I help you?|Why doesn't my key work and what's all my stuff doin' downstairs?
Well, I'm, I'm sorry...[Eddie forces his head in the door] Ahhh. Have we met?|It's Eddie you freak, your roommate.
I, I'm sorry, I uh [unchains the door and opens it all the way] I already have a roommate. [Joey turns around in the leather recliner]|Hello.
Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man.|No he, he moved out and I moved in.
Well I, I think we'd remember something like that.|I know I would.
See ya. [shuts the door] Goodbuy you fruit drying psychopath. So you want me to help you unpack your stuff?|Na, na I'm ok. Oh and uh, just so you know, I'm not movin' back in 'cause I have to. Well, I mean, I do have to. It's just that that place wasn't really, I mean, this is...
Welcome home man. [they hug and jump around]|A little foos?
Absolutely.|What happened to the foosball?
Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?|He paid a lot of money for it.
I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?|Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky.
Hey. Watcha guys doin?|Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.
Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie.|What?
C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun.|Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?|That's not the end.
Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.|What about the part where he has rabies?
He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.|Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.|Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.|Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.|Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. [starts poking Monica in the shoulder] 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?|Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
I don't know.|C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?|Ok, this could be tough.
[Monica walks back in the kitchen] Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.|Ooh, you almost had it.
[smells Ben's butt] No no, you're fine, you're fine.|[enters with Susan] Hello
Hi.|Hey.
Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.|What?
Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it.|Uhh, we know, he already did it last week.
I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?|Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-|Great. That would be fine.
Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared.|Oh shout, that would have been fun.
Hey.|Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?
Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment.|Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay.
Hey.|Hey.
Your boyfriend is so cool.|Really?
Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.|Wow, he must like you the best.
You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car [passes the dollar back].|No problem. Hey Chandler
I think they get it.|Ok.
There's the man.|He-he-eyy. [Shakes his had and passes the dollar]
So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?|Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
Ross.|Yeah.
Look. [they look at Joey in the kitchen with a cigar in his mouth, looking at his reflection in a spatula] Joey, do you know we can see you from here?|How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.|Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.|Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.|Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.|No luck huh?
Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.|Oh, yeah sure, Ok. [she takes Ben and holds him at arms length]
What're you doing?|Uh, I'm holding Ben.
Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.|Ok.
Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.|This is how I would hold a football.
Ok, here, here. There we go.|Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
It's alright, it's no big deal.|Really?
Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.|What?
What?|You think about stuff like that?
Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.|Two, two babies?
Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.|Then what's gonna happen?
Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.|Uh-huh.
Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.|Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
Huh?|I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this [hands back Ben] and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? [leaves]
Hey.|Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.|So you watched the movies huh?
Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.|Charlotte who?
With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.|Alright, you wanna feel better?
Yeah.|Ok, here, watch this.
It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.|So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.|Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.|[runs in] Hey, big guy, game time.
Sure.|It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.|[enters] Aghh.
Me too. [leaves]|I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.|Did you like it?
Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.|Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
Kick save and... denied.|But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.|Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
See, that's why we don't let her play.|Is everything all right?
Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.|Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
No.|Nooooo.
Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.|Uh-huh, yeah.
No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.|That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
You're not a dad. You're not a dad.|Not a dad.
I can't believe you got us into trouble. [slaps Joey on the arm. Joey takes exception and slaps him back]|[her and Richard return to her place] So are you ok?
Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.|Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
[doorbell buzzes] Hello.|It's us.
Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. [walks in his room]|Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. [finishes the diaper] There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.
Wha, what?|Ben just said hi.
What, the word hi?|Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi.
Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything.|Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him.
Something about hi.|That's so exciting.
Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him.|Tuesday.
Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys.|Take care.
Bye Ben.|Bye.
Alright, alright, ok. Bye.|Bye.
Bye.|Bye.
Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.|[pauses the tape] Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. [starts the tape again]
Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.|Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?|'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.
Freaky.|Weird, weird.
Man, I am so beat.|Oh yeah.
Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?|Yeah alright.
[walks back from the counter] Hey you're in our seats.|Oh, sorry we didn't know.
What's with this guy?|What's with you?
What just happened?|I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.
That, that is funny. Can I have it back?|No.
No?|No.
Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?|You got a problem with that?
Hey, how'd the interview go?|It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
So don't do it.|How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
What's the matter with you?|The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
Noo.|You're kiddin'.
Oohhh.|Hi.
Hi. [Ross turns to Rachel and they hug]|Ohhh [turns as if to hug someone] Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one.
What?|My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it.
Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market.|What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls...[on the phone] Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store.
See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?|Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'.
Yeah good luck, good luck.|Thanks. [gets out of the cab]
Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?|Ohh, what is in that?
Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo.|No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross.
Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?|Are you kidding me?
Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.|Ok, here, I know what we can do. [grabs Joey's sadwich and throws it out the window]
Hey, hey, hey no.|Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. [dog ignores the sandwich] Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?
Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will.|Are you crazy?
Hey.|What?
Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?|Do you say this stuff to girls?
Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to.|You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
Don't play with his things.|I know.
You had to ask.|Yeah.
Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys.|Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again.
Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go.|Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?|Ok, thanks. Sorry, again
[innocently] What was that?|Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.
I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.|Time is money my friend?
Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?|Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50.
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY.|How come those?
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy.|What happened to uh, MEG.?
MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down.|That is so not my motto.
DON'T...be too long with the phone.|She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
Your cappucino sir.|Thank you.
Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.|Absolutely.
How come it's not mixing with the water?|Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle.
[walks out of his room] Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there.|Ok.
Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?|Yeah, sure.
By someone besides Monica?|No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'.
[Opens the door] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.|What?
Hi, welcome home. [pulls Rachel inside] I need to borrow a hundred bucks.|For what?
I've gotta get back in the game.|Why, when did you get out of the game?
I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it.|Oh no.
Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too.|Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?|I, I don't have it.
But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs.|Nobody does honey.
Hi.|Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?
It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian.|What are these, stitches?
Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast.|Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.
Sure, oh, is, is Frank home.|How do you know Frank?
Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?|Yeah. Frank.
Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior.|He went out for groceries.
Ok so will he be back soon?|Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?|Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
Heavy.|Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?
No but he didn't really talk about anything.|Oh.
Except stilts.|Stilts?
Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts.|Wow.
Yeah.|I don't know what to do with that.
Me neither. So you're like my big sister.|Yeah.
This is huge, you can buy me beer.|I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'
I gotta friend named Mark.|That'll work too.
Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'.|Yeah, that'd be ok.
Alright.|Ok, I'm in the book.
Ok, yeah.|Alright. So um, stilts huh?
Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.|Ok.
Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?|Would you come on! Come on! [waitress brings their coffee] Thank you.
Ah, there we go.|I think we proved our point.
You burn your mouth?|Cannot feel my tounge.
Bullies, big bullies.|Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.
Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.|Let's do this alright.
Alright, let's do this.|Alright.
Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?|Whad'ya mean?
Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.|No, you can't use your watch.
Ok. [reaches in his pocket]|Or your keys.
Ok.|Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. [they all put their keys and watches in the hat and put it on a mail box] Alright, c'mon man, let's do this.
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?|Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?
Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.|Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.
Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh.|Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! [some guy runs off with the hat]
Hey.|Hey.
God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.|Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy.
Yeah he was wasn't he.|Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything.
So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?|We're ok.
Alright.|Ok so, can I have my hat back?
Look at her.|Hi Monica.
So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.|Ohhh.
What?|Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
You wanna be in charge of the food committee?|Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See [squeezes her breast] honk honk.|Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.|Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
Hi honey, how did it go?|Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?|Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
[answers the door] Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?|What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.|Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.|I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.|So, basically just a Chinese guy.
Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.|You thought I was Rachel?
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.|Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.|Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.|Right this is staging.
Alright you guys are off to party number one [ushers 3 guys into Monica's apartment] and you, you are off to party number two [ushers four women into his apartment. Two guys try to follow and Chandler blocks them and shoos them off to Monica's apartment] Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.|Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? [buzzer goes off] Alright that's Ross.
Ok, they're coming, shhh. [Runs into Monica's apartment and grabs one last girl to take to his apartment]|Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
Surprise.|Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great.
Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?|Well, we could count again.
I can't believe this is happening.|You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
I do.|That's who.
Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.|Well, actually just one birthday flan.
What?|It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.|Quick volleyball question.
Volleyball.|Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.|Dennis.
Ok, that's me. [runs back]|Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?|It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. [she demonstrates, Gunther starts to walk to the door] Gunther, where're you going?|I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.|Listen if you wanna go, just go.
I think I need a drink.|Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
Scotch.|Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.
Neat.|Cool.
No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks.|I know.
Oh hello Ross, where have you been?|Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse.
I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.|No. no.
Whad'ya mean no?|No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
Get my glasses too.|All righty roo. [closes the door] What a great moment to say that for the first time. [goes to get the cigarettes and glasses]
Are you wearing my glasses?|Yes. [pulls them off and hands them to Mr. Greene] I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?|[pulls the cigarette off his upper lip and hands it to Mr. Greene] Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.|What about my friend Victor?
No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.|Alright, let me just get my coat.
There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.|Is it true they have beer?
You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?|Um [gestures to dance floor]
Phoebe.|Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
You want me to see a therapist?|Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.|Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
You work and you work and you work on a boat...|He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
...and you sand it and you varnish it...|...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...|...the scotch and the cigarettes...
...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...|...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
[running out of his apartment after a girl] Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. [sits down beside Rachel] Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.|This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.|Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?|It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.|Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
Ok will do. So glad you came.|I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.|Oh ok.
Ahh, you drive safe.|Ross, what're you doing.
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.|Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. [opens the door, the guys are right there] Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
Ok everybody, it's time for flan.|Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
Ok, that's enough.|Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
Oh, I ordered mine first.|Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
Give it to me.|No.
[She grabs the coffee cup on the table and licks the rim.] There you go, enjoy your coffee.|That was there when I got here. [Takes a bite of his muffin.]
[Chandler tries to come back with a smart-ass remark but can't swallow the muffin.] Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.|Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
You went out with a guy in the Navy?|Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.|[enters] Hiii.
Had it.|Had it.
Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.|Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
Monica... [He re-enters the bedroom and Monica jumps on the bed, trying to cover it.] Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?|Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
What're you doing?|Just waiting for you sweetie.
Are you remaking the bed?|I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
Then, you're redoing it because...|If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
You're pretty much running that risk either way.|Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
Oh, well that's not so crazy.|I'm just easing you in.
Oh, alright.|Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.|Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.|But don't you need experience for a job like that?
It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.|[enters] Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.|No kidding.
I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.|Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.|You look fabulous honey, you really do.
You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.|I, I, I'm hideous.
Come in.|Hey baby, I'm back... [Phoebe is sitting by the window in a veil.]
Hey Ryan, what's up?|What's goin' on?
Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.|Chicken or small?
Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.|Why aren't you at home in bed?
'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.|I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
Ohh, ohh.|If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.|Can I please see your face?
Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.|Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... [she unveils herself right as a huge lightning bolt crashes outside. Ryan screams in terror.] Oh, I am scary.|Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.|Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. [He walks to her and kisses her.]
Hey.|Hey, how's the first day goin'?
Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.|Well there you go.
Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.|Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?|Weird world. Your kids?
I figure my character has kids.|Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.|Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.|Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
You know what makes the itching even worse?|That you don't stop talking about it.
Fine.|Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. [She picks up the dice.] Here we go, double sixes, here we go... [She starts to rub the dice all over herself.] Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
What're you doing? Are you scratching?|No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
You're scratching. Give me the dice.|No.
Give me the dice.|No. Here. [Throws them on the table.] There. Ooh, double sixes.
We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.|Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. [Grabs a handful of the houses.]
No.|Give it.
Oh God help me.|Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
Oh, stop that, stop that right now.|You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.|Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.|Bye bye Joey.
What a phony.|Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
Sir.|Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
Yeah Bing, what's that about?|It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.|Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
Joseph's good, isn't he?|Well, I'm going to kill you.
Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.|Why?
Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?|This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
You're strict.|It's for their own good.
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.|Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.|Very good.
Thank you.|You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
You're gonna do what to my clocks.|I'm gonna set them to my time.
Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.|No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.|No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
No come on. Come on tell me.|No. See you don't understand.
Come on.|No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
No that's not true. That is not true.|Oh yeah.
Yeah.|Alright, well tell me one of yours.
Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.|What if they get mixed up?
Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.|You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.|Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.|Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.|Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.|I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.|Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
Karen.|Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.|Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
Really?|No freakshow, she's fictional.
Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.|Thank you.
Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.|No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
Wine?|Please. [Ryan pulls the cork with his teeth and spits it into Phoebe's mits.]
Oh, I spilled some.|I got it. [Wipes it up with her mits.]
[Puts his hands over Phoebe's ears.] I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.|What?
Sorry. You look beautiful.|Oh.
Monica, wake up. Monica.|What's up?
I thought of a thing.|Yeah?
Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.|No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
Or so I would have you believe.|No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.|Alright, go on.
Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.|Oh my God, you're a freak.
So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?|I really can't say.
Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.|I'm sorry, but I can't say.
It was nice to meet you.|Take care.
So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?|You like that do ya?
Oh yeah.|I'll make some calls. [Runs off.]
Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?|I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. [They kiss.]
Taxi.|Bye you. [Ryan's cab drives off. As Phoebe is going back in, she sees the Central Perk sign in the window and laughs.]
Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.|Is this what you had in mind?
I'm shipping out tomorrow.|Well then uh, we better make this night count. [He starts to carry her out.] Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. [He carries her over to turn it off.] Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. [He carries her to the counter to pick up her purse.] Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?|Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
Hey, what did your agent say?|Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.|Oh my God, you look so good!
So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.|Because I promised Mindy I would.
What's she look like?|Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
Get out!|Nooo!
Where's Benny, there he is.|Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.|Okay.
Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?|Sure I do.
Yeah, am I in it?|Honey, you are in it.
Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.|Oh, yeah!
Keep talkin'.|Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?|Like a hound?
Not a basset, a bassinet.|You really need the bassinet?
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.|Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
Uh-huh.|Look I want you, now.
Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much.  Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.|Joey, no means no!
Hey!|I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.|Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.|Neither am I.
Hey, there.|Hi.
Are you all right?|Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.|God I know, you're right.
Okay, good luck|Thank you, Okay, Okay.
Why the hell didn't you tell me!|I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.|Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.|Rachel!
Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.|It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.
Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.|Rach! Rach!
Oh, hi!|Oh my God, I'm married!
I know.|I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.|Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?|Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
Insane!|...from the syphilis.
What?!|Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an Indian and walks into|Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.|Okay, last chance.  Again, I'm sorry.
You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.|I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
Okay, I'll do it.|You'll do what?
If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.|Oh my God!
If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team.|Really?
Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will.|You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
But you're not.|Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one.
God. I love you.|I know you do. Me too.  So what now?
Where is she, Where is she?  Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?|Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here.
Ooh, oh, oh, that's her.|Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind.
Oh my God!|OH.....MY.....GAWD!!
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .|Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.|Did not, she did not wink at you....
I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.|Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
Hey Mon!|Hey Mon!
Nope.|No, it's been three nights in a row.
Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.|Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
Morning.|Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.|Good morning Joey.
Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.|Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.|I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.|Kiss her! Kiss her!
Nope, not this time.|Come on, quite yankin' me.
I'm not yanking you.|This is Janice.
Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.|Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
God, look what I found in the drain.|What?!
It's some of Richard's hair!  What do I do with this?|Getting it away from me would be job one.
It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!|Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
God, what is wrong with me.|You need to get some sleep.
I need to get some Richard.|Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!|Maybe, because you told him not to.
What are you the memory woman?|Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
Honey, I was wondering....|Hmm?
Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?|Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
Hmm.|I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
You remember not having sex in high school, right?|Yeah.
Well honey, what about you?|What?
I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?|No.
Come on you gotta have one!|Nope.
Ross, you know what...|What?
...if you tell me, I might do it.|Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
Yeah.|Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
Oooh!|Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.|Really!
Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.|Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!|Really! That-that great huh?
No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!|Hey!
Hey!|Wheel!
Of!|Fortune! This guy is so stupid.  It's Count Rushmore!!
You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?|I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
No, Janice.|Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?|No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. ?
Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!|Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
Well, there you go.|Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry, those are the right letters.|Look, what do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you like her!|I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
Thanks for trying.  Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!|Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
How could you have told her?|Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.|Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.|Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.|Were both of those Joey?
Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.|Not even with your best friend.
Noo!|That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?|Pretty much.
Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?|Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.|Richard's living room, drinking wine.
All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!|I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.|All right, I'll try not to.
Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....|Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....|I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....|Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
So, I hear, you hate me!|I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.|And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.|But what does that gonna do...
For Chandler!|Okay. I'm in.
Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'|Does it have to be a whole day?
Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.|Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.|Monica, do you want us to take you home?
Uh, huh.|Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
We're baack!|Hey!
Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!|Really.
I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.|You still can't stand her can you?
April Twelve, Eighteen hundred, Sixty-One  it is now under bombardment by....|Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?|No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.|Taste it.
Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!|Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
We have a half hour.|No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.|Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
Hey, Ross, want some cider?|No.  So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?|No! Do you wanna hear it?
Am I in it?|Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
Whoa!|Wow, hello! You look great!
What?|You're in my seat.
How is this your seat?|'Cause I was sitting there.
But then you left.|Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.|The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...|You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
All right! You can have the chair.|Really!
Oh my, would you look at that!|Is that too spooky?
I'm so sorry.|What am I gonna do?
Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.|All right!
Monica, how are you gonna do that?|I know the code to his answering machine.
Wow, what a cool job.  'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'|"Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.|Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay.
He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.|Monica, you don't know that.
Well, who's voice was that?|Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?|Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.|Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.|It was, it was her voice.
Okay. That was her right?|Definitely.
See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.|Yay!
Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....|You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.|No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Okay, fine.|They got a phone in there, right?
Not any more!|Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.|Your outgoing message has now been changed.
"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!|How did you do that?
I don't know!|Good-bye.
Noooo!!!!|Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.|Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute.|Wow! What a pleasure.
WHOAA!!|See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.|Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.|I didn't know there were docks.
Hey.|Hey.
No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.|Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.|Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.
What is this? Fruit?|Monica's making jam.
Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?|Because the kids need new shoes.
Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.|You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
What?|One more chance Ursula, please?
Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.|Wh..
Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.|Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
Oh, you're not a dingus.|I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.|Well thanks.
Wait,  you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?|Not really.
Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.|Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?|Yeah, okay.
Okay.  Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.|Sorry.
Mon?|Mon?
'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'|Wait a minute, look.
What?|Look, look, look.
What, what, what?|It's an empty apartment.
Oooh.|We're all alone in an empty apartment.
Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes|There it is.
Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey.|Hey.
Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.|Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
Nooo!|And it works both ways.
Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.|Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work.|Oh.
All right are you guys gonna come down?|Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
Good luck Chandler.|Thank you Rachel.
Bye hon.|Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?|You're so pretty.
You talked to him. Are you crazy?|Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
|Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
Aww.  Ohh!|Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked
Put your hands together.|Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
No more jam?!|Well, what happened to your jam plan?
Night-night Bing-a-ling.|Night-night.....Janice.
Here's my binoculars.|Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.|Oh, yeah. What's this?
Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?|Um, not even a little bit.
It's about you.|Oh, okay then.
I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.|Good. So what were you thinking?
I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.|Really?
No.|Oh.
See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.|Oh, okay.
No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.|Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
You mean there's more than one of us.|Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
And that's how you bought it?|Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.|What are you saying I should do?
Oh my God, what happened?|Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.|Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
Ross's what?|You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
Phoebe?|Yes? Yes! Oh.
What are you doing?|Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
Were you following me?|Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.|Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.|No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know  Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
Uh-huh, I don't know.|Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?
Hey.|Hey.
Where you going?|To the bank.
Sperm or regular?|Sperm.
So you're really doing this, huh?|Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135.
Sounds nice.|'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...
No kiddin', hmm.|What?
No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy.|Really? Why?
I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.|Hoyt?
It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.|Really, is he a swimmer?
He's got the body for it.|I like that.  What?
You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.|We do not have one of those signs.
Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.|Two girls and a boy?
Yeah!|And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.
Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too.|Yeah.
I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person.|Honey, you got a little thing on your...
Did I get it?|Yeah.
Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!|Oh, oh! It's on again!
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.|Aw! There's got to be a better way!
Well, it's official there are no good movies.|Well, let's go to a bad one and make out.
Hey, man. What's up?|Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!
Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me.|Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!
Is anybody else scared?|
Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!|Oh, now you want a pad.
Hey!!|There's my boy! Here's my boy! And here's his Barbi  What's ah, what's my boy doing with a Barbi?
Oh, it's your audition from this morning. Can I use the phone again?|Sure Pheebs, you know, that's what it's there for, emergencies and pretend agents.
'Hi, I have Phoebe Buffay returning a page. Okay, well, um, she's in her car I'll have to patch you through.'|Very nice touch.
Op, went through a tunnel.|Unbelievable.
It was really fun, I mean I've never talked on a car phone before.|You were amazing, could you just do me this huge favor, you see there's this one other audition that I really, really want, and Estelle couldn't get me in.
Oh, I don't know. I mean it was fun one time.|Come on, please, it'll be just this one more, well actually it's two.
Two?|Yeah! Well, well really it's three. Please. You're so good at it. I love you.
Okay, I'll do it, but just these three, right|Nooo, four.
So, how come you wanted to eat in tonight?|'Cause, I wanted to uh, give you this.
Ohhh, are you a puppy!  Contact paper! I never really know what to say when someone you're sleeping with gives you contact paper.|Well, wait there's, there's more. See the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer.  See, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.
Oh, you didn't have to do this.|Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get.
Well, I gotta buy a vowel. Because, oh my Gawd! Who, would've thought that someday, Chandler Bing would buy me a drawer.|Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip.
We should?|Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!
I don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now! Are you okay?|I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay.
You probably want us to move in together?|It doesn't scare me!
Yeah, well, it scares me! I mean I not even divorced yet, Chandler. You know, you just invited me over here for pasta, and all of the sudden you're talking about moving in together. And, and I wasn't even that hungry. You know what, it's getting a little late, and I-I should just, um...|Oh, no, no, no, don't go! I've scared ya'! I've said too much! I'm hopeless, and awkward, and desperate for love!!
Honey, this will help.|So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down.
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Maybe it's not so bad. How did you leave it?|She said she'd call me.
Yeah, well that's that lo-cal, non dairy, soy milk junk. We sort of, we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases.|You know, when you start get screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.
Yeah, you do.|So, you don't think I'm terminal?
This is a very critical time right now. If you feel yourself reaching for that phone, then you go shoe shopping, you get your butt in a bubble bath. You want her back you have to start acting aloof.|She has to know that your not ready.
Right. So, what you have to do is, you have to accidentally run into her on purpose. And then act aloof.|So I'm not, not gonna lose her?
Oooh, honey, you're not a total loser.|I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'
Guess who's here. It's the toughest guy in toy land, Ben.  'A real American hero. I'm G.I. Joe!' Drop the Barbi, drop the Barbi.|G.I. Joe? Do you really think he's gonna fall for that?
Look Ben, it's a toy that protects U.S. oil interests overseas!|Go Joe!!!
Chandler!|Hello, Janice.
What are you doing here?|Oh, just a bit of shopping. How've you been?
Are you being British?!|No. Not anymore.
Why are you shopping here? You don't live in this neighborhood. Were you here waiting for me?|Yeah, huh. I'm just uh, you know I'm just picking up some things for a party.
Barley? What kind of party serves barley?|Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.
Where is this party?|Here in Chelsea.
Who's party is it?|A woman's
What woman?!|Chelsea.
Okay, you know, one of two things is happening here. Either you're seeing somebody behind my back, which would make you the biggest jerk on the planet. Or, else you're pretending that you're seeing somebody, which just makes you so pathetic that I could start crying right here in the cereal aisle. So like which of these two guys do you want to be?|Can I be that guy?
Okay, so we got some more good rejections, lots of stuff to work on.|Okay, shoot.
Okay, um, oh, the zoo commercial.|I didn't get it?
No. They said you 'Weren't believable as a human being.' So, you can work on that.|Okay, what else?
Um, the off-Broadway play people said 'You were pretty but dumb.'|Oh.
Oh no wait, I'm sorry, that's 'pretty dumb.'|Look, it's okay, no, no, no, really, look um, I really appreciate this Pheebs, but I think I'm gonna have to go back to Estelle.
Oh.|Yeah, well don't get me wrong, you're a better agent than she is, but at least with her I don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out.
Yeah, no, I understand.|You do, thanks.
Yeah. Sorry.|Wait a minute.
What?|Wait a minute, did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent.
Oh, you caught me. I am so busted.|That's-ah what I suspected-ah.
....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store.|My God! Chandler, we said be 'aloof' not 'a doof'.
I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?|Yeah, it is.
Okay, what do I do?|Shhh...I don't know what to do, this is totally unprecedented.
Hello!|Oh wait, you know what, I got it, I got it, pretend like you just woke up, okay, that will throw her off. Be sleepy.
What are you, stop naming dwarves!  Really?!|He's soo lucky, if Janice were a guy, she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now.
I love you too.|Aw, it's soo unfair.
G. I. Joe. G. I. Joe?!|Hey, I don't know what to tell you guys that's the doll he chose.
Oh please God, let there be a song.|There was no song.  There was no song!
|
Hey!|Hey!
Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?|No. Y'know how we’re always saying we need a place for the mail.
Yeah!|Well, I started building one. But then I decided to take it to the next step.
You’re building a post office?|No, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in. It’s a one day job, max.
Okay.  My word! Those are snug.|Oh yeah. These are my old work pants, Sergio Valente’s.
Hey Pheebs.|Hey!
Any sign of your brother?|No, but he’s always late.
I thought you only met him once?|Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, ‘Frank’s always late.’
Well relax, he’ll be here.|No, I know, I’m just nervous. Y'know it’s just y'know Mom’s dead, don’t talk to my sister, Grandma’s been sleeping a lot lately. It’s like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You’re so sweet to wait with me.
Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?|No, but he told me, he thinks your a fox.
All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list.|Her what?
Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one can’t get mad.|Ah, the heart of every healthy relationship. Honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.
Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.|Now, you do realize that she’s a cartoon, and way out of your league?
I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.|Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
Peter Parker.|Thank you.
What a geek!|Everbody this is Frank! This is my half-brother Frank.
Hi.|Hi.
We don’t, really.|Well, so, now, do you guys have a lot of big plans?
You know, we don’t really take advantage of living in the city.|I know.
Oh, I’m sorry. Did I get ‘ya?|No, you didn’t get me!! It’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!
Calm down, do you want this unit or not?|I do NOT want this unit!!
Well, you should’ve told me that before, I’m not a mind reader. Hey, we’re out of beer. I’m going to Monica’s.|Fine!
Hey! Where ‘ya headin’ in those pants? 1982?|Oh Monica, listen, I ah, I saw down at the hardware store, they got those designer tiles on sale. If you ever want to redo the bathroom floor.
Why, what’s wrong with my bathroom floor?|Nothing. It’s just old and dingy, that’s all.
I highly doubt that.|Oh yeah. If you ah, move your hamper, you see what color the tile used to be.  Yeah.
I can’t live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?|Relax. Here hold this
That’s a little more than I wanted to see.|
I can’t leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.|Eh! There you go.
Oh, ew!|What?
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.|What, wait, you mean like this?
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.|Your not doing it.
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....|When’s your birthday?
Feburary 16th.|I know a guy who’s the 18th.
Wow, that’s close. When’s yours?|October 25th.
That’s the same month as Halloween. So, um, what kinda things do you like to do at home?|Melt stuff.
Okay, I’ve got three of my five.|Three of your five, what?
Celebrities I’m allowed to sleep with.|Oh my God! You are giving this a lot of thought.
Yeah, it’s hard okay, I only have two spots left.|All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....|Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
Susan Sarandon.|Eh, y'know what, she’s to political, she probably wouldn’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
And!! Isabella Rosselini.|Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she’s too international, y'know she’s never gonna be around.
Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.|Yeah.
So is it like art?|Yeah, you can melt art. Hey, can I use your phone?
Um, yeah sure. Why you wanna call your Mom?|No, I wanna melt it.
Oh, well um, not right now. Y'know I’m just gonna go to bed, I think the fumes are giving me a headache.|Yeah!
G’night, bro.|G’night.
Here.  Y'know, just in case.|Oh, excellent.
What kind of karate is that?|No kind. He just makes it up.
So how’s it going with you guys?|So far, it kinda blows. I don’t know, I just thought y'know that he’d feel more like a brother y'know, like you and Ross, just like close and connected and....
Oh honey, we’re close now but you-you wouldn’t believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That’s where the waistband actually goes over your head.|Ah!!
Oh, we used to drive each other crazy playing the shadow game.|Oh, how do you play the shadow game?
Oh, how do you play the shadow game?|I just asked you.
I just asked you.|I don’t have time for this.
No, that is what the game is.|Which you just gave up really quickly.
What’s the matter?|Oh, just this!  Y’know what it’s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.
He’s retiling my floor.|Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
Ah-ah-ah, now you started this, you will finish it.|He started mine first!
Whoa! Big octopus.|Yeah.  Um, Frank, I’m really sorry but I have to go to work. It’s-it’s one of my regulars and he’s insisting that I do ‘um.
Hey, what kind of work do you do?|Oh! I’m a masseuse. I give people massages and stuff.
You-you work at one of those massage parlors?|Well, y'know we don’t call it that, but yeah!
Wow! That’s wild! No, I had no idea.|All righty. I’ll be back in-in a little bit. Unless you wanna come with me?
You mean like watch?|No, no, you can get one yourself. It’ll be on the house! Y'know what are big sisters for?
Well, I don’t think this, y'know.|No, no, no, I wouldn’t do you myself, I mean that would be weird. Yeah, no, I’ll get one of the other girls to do it. Oh, this will be so much fun! Hey! Are you excited?
It’s beautiful! It’s like the first bathroom floor there ever was.  Whoa! Are you going in there for?|What, like a number?
And who laminated it?|That would be me.
Ow!-Ow!-Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Y'know, ow!|Hey!-Hey! What’s going on?
She broke my arm.|He touched my fanny.
No, she touched mine first!|That’s my job!
So wait, what’s the deal here, I can have sex with you, but I can’t touch you?|Ewww!!!
No, your a masseuse, it’s cool, I’m not a cop.|Okay, Jasmine, can you, can you ask Mr. Whiffler if he can wait for like five minutes.
Wait that’s-that’s, what that’s not what you do?|Nooo! Why would you think that?
I don’t know, I mean, y'know, this is the city y'know, I just, I mean, I don’t know.|Whatever, it’s the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyways.
Oh, wait, no your right, no it was perfect and I can’t believe that I screwed it up so bad.|You really thought it was perfect?
Well, no, maybe-maybe it wasn’t perfect, but y'know it was pretty cool, y'know, ‘cause we had all those great talks y'know.|Yeah, um, which ones in particular were great for you?
Well y'know about the tongue thing, y'know, and how I told you about my likes and my dislikes...|I don’t....
How-how I like to melt stuff, and how I dislike stuff that doesn’t melt.|Right, okay, um-mm.
Yeah, y'know I feel like I can really talk to you ‘cause y'know you’re my sister, y'know.|Yeah, I guess I do, yeah.
Then I go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.|Well, I-I wasn’t hopping mad, y'know.
You hopped a little bit. Yeah, I really sorry.|Okay. All right, this is my favourite part of the weekend, right now, this.
This?|Uh-huh.
Oh come on we went, we went to Time Square, we found ninja stars, I almost got arm broken by a hooker...|She wasn’t a hooker.
Okay, on three. One....Two....|Why don’t we just go on two.
Why two?|Because it’s faster.
Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this ‘two’ talk.|Oh!
Okay, one...two...|So we are going on two?
Oh, good job Joe.|Wow, it’s big!
Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!|Maybe, my ruler’s wrong.
Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how ‘bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?|Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right?  You freak.|Thank you.
Oh-oh, you lie.|What you don’t think I’d go up to her?
Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.|Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
You know what honey, you go ahead, we’ll call her an alternate.|Okay, hold my crawler.
Okay.|Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
Honey, he’s about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I’m just sorry we don’t got popcorn.|Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
Y'know what?|Umm?
I bet ‘ya ya I could fit in there.|I’ve got five bucks says you can’t.
Get out your checkbook, mister.|Oh, I think I have the cash.
You are dogged man! I totally fit!|Yeah, you got me.  Here you go.
Janice has a question. Who of the six of you has sleep with the six of you?|Wow, it’s like a dirty math problem.
Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.|Well, that’s really a different question.
I’m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.|Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.
Okay, okay, well then answer me this. Has any of you ever.... almost?|Does anybody need more coffee?
Oh, that is so unfortunate.|What?
Cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight.|Okay, I’ll be back in just a minute. Oh, Phoebe I’m sorry that I left lipstick marks on the phone.
You didn’t leave lipstick marks on the phone.|Oh, then it must’ve been you. Bye.
That’s why I moved out.|Hey, y'know while we’re on that, when are you gonna tell my sister that you don’t live here anymore.
I think on some levels she already knows.|Phoebe, she doesn’t know that you sneak out every night, she doesn’t know that you sneak back every morning, and she doesn’t know that you’ve been living with your Grandmother’s for a week now.
Okay, well maybe not on those levels.|Hey.
Why, nobody good?|Well let’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, that’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!
Oh, really?|Yeah, y'know how I have you guys, well she doesn’t really have any close friends that are just hers, but last week she meet this woman at the gym, Susan something, and they really hit it off, and I-I-I think it’s gonna make a difference
Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?|Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that’s cool.
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.|Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way. Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.
Bye-bye.|Don’t you ah, don’t you wanna ask me any questions?
Sure. Ummm. What’s up?|Well, ah, I’m an actor. I’m fairly neat. I ah, I got my own TV. Oh, and don’t worry I’m totally okay with the gay thing.
What gay thing?|Ah, y'know just in general people being gay, thing. I’m totally cool with that.
Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by.|Hi.
Hey, Mon.|Hey-hey-hey. You wanna hear something that sucks.
Do I ever.|Chris says they’re closing down the bar.
No way!|Yeah, apparently they’re turning it into some kinda coffee place.
Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?|Got me.
Can I get a beer.|Hey, did you pick a roommate?
You betcha!|Is it the Italian guy?
Um-mm, yeah right!|He’s so cute.
Oh yes, and that’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one.|Oh look, the pool table’s free. Rack ‘em up. I’ll be back in just a minute. Get ready for me to whip your butt.
Okay, but after that, we’re shootin’ some pool.|Oh, um, no, no, no, no excuse me, hello. Hi. My friend ordered an onion, not an olive, and uh I ordered a rum and Diet Coke, which I don’t think this is.
Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball.|Yeah, so?
|Oh my God, I went to high school with her.  Rachel! Hi!
No real-, honey, really it’s fine, just g-go with Susan. Really, I, no, I think girls night out is a great idea. Okay, okay, bye|So what are they doing?
I don’t know, something girlie.|Hey, you’re early.
Hi, again.|Hey!
Thank you soo, much.|Oh, don’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work.
You want some help with that?|Oh, no thanks, I got it.  No I don’t!
Whoa! Are you okay?|Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.
It’s the heat.  And-and the humidity.|That’s a uh, that’s a tough combination.
Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?|Like you wouldn’t believe.  Wow! This is a great place.
Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.|Gotcha.
This place is really my Grandmother’s.  I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?|Oh, you bet I am!
Oh my God!!! What are you doing?!!|You said, you wanna come in for some lemonade?
So?!|Whoa, ah!! We’re you just gonna give me some lemonade?
Yeah huh!! Cover yourself up!|Oh right, right.
I don’t believe this! When someone asks you in for lemonade, and to you that means they wanna have sex?|Well usually...yeah! Well, not just lemonade, iced tea, sometimes juice. Well, sorry, I just, I thought you liked me. I’m such a jerk.
Pheebs?|Huh?
Where’s your bed?|It’s not in the apartment?  Oh no. I can’t believe this is happening again.
What?|Okay, enough with the third degree! I-I’ve, I don’t live here anymore.
What are you talking about?|I’m sorry, I-I-I-I don’t live here anymore. I-I didn’t know how to tell you, but y'know everybody else knows!
Everybody knows!|That was supposed to be a good thing, I forget why. Just listen, Monica, I, do you know, okay, do you know, I couldn’t sleep for like a month because I got like a dot of ink on one of the sofa cushions.
Well, you-you coulda just turned the cushion over.|Yeah, I would’ve except I had a big spaghetti stain on the other side.
What?!?!|Okay, this is what I’m talking about, this. I-I need to live in a land where people can spill.
You can spill. In the sink.|Aw, honey it’s not your fault, y'know this is who you are, and I love you, and I want us to be friends, and if I keep living here I don’t see that happening.
I love you, too.|Aww, good.  What?
What? I’m just said.|No you’re not, you’re wondering which cushion it is.
So ah, whatcha watching?|Baywatch.
What’s it about?|Lifeguards.
Well, it sounds kinda stupid...  Who’s she?|Nicole Eggert. You'll like her.
Wow! Look at them run.|They do that a lot. Hey, you want a beer?
Yeah, I’ll go get one.|No, no, no, don’t get up, I got a cooler right here.
Well, hello!|Hey.
Do you have any beers? We’re out of beers.|Help yourself.
You okay?|Phoebe moved out.
Right.|I don’t understand, I mean am I so hard to live, is this why I don’t have a boyfriend?
Noo!! You don’t have a boyfriend because....I don’t, I don’t know why you don’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend.|Well, I think so.
Hi. Where is everybody?|Oh, it’s already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?
My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over.|Oh no! Why?
‘Cause Carol’s a lesbian.  And, and I’m not one. And apparently it’s not a mix and match situation.|Oh my God! I don’t believe it! Oh, you poor bunny.
I’m an idiot. I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I’d be out and she’d, she’d see some beautiful woman, and, and she’d be Ross y'know look at her, and I’d think, God, my wife is cool!|Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?
Well, now I do!!|I’m sorry.
Seven years. I mean we’ve been together seven years, she’s the only woman who’s ever loved me, and the only woman I’ve-I’ve ever....|Aw, God Ross. Oh.
Umm, this is nice.|I know, it is isn’t it?
No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?|Yeah! And I got it on sale, too.
Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.|Well, if you wanna get a drink later we can.
Oh yeah, that sounds great.  Oh, and listen, it’s, it’s gonna be....|I know. Thanks.
Maybe this would’ve happened if I’d been more nurturing, or I’d paid more attention, or I... had a uterus. I can’t believe this!|I know no, no, y'know you don’t deserve this, you don’t Ross. You’re, you’re really, you’re so good.
Thanks.|And you’re so sweet.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.|Huh?
Wait, wait, wait.|What?
My foot is stuck in the pocket.|What?
No, I can’t get it out.|Well, that’s not something a girl wants to hear.
No, come on don’t start.  Ouch!|What?
Oh well. It probably would’ve been the most constructive solution.|You have chalk on your face.
Huh?|Oh, Ross you’re right, I don’t know why I always thought this was real grass.
My wife’s a lesbian.|Cool!!
I can’t believe you came back.|Don’t say anything. I don’t wanna speak, I don’t wanna think. I just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here, right now.
So I told Carl, ‘Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.’ But of course this went in one ear and out.....|I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he’s Alan Alda.
Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.|I was always Joanne.
‘Okay.|We?
Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that’s okay.|Oh shoot, tomorrow’s not so good, I’m supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
Ross, my father doesn’t hate you.|Please, he refers to me as ‘wethead’.
But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do.  All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I’ll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.|I’ll go.
Thank you.|Hi Gunther.
Ugh! I don’t know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice’s ex-husband, that’s like betraying Chandler.|Not at these prices.
Woo!|Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
Hi!|Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, ’Hey, the bell doesn’t dismiss you, I dismiss you.’|Ooooh, nice.
Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.|Oh, yay!
Yeah, it’s this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I’m so, so right for it, y'know, he’s just like me. Except he’s a boxer, and has an evil twin.|Oh.
Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?|Yeah, so please, please, please, don’t say anything to Chandler.
You want me to lie to Chandler?|Is that a problem?
No.|Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let’s see what you got. All right ya, put ‘em up. Come on.
Hey, you’re ah, pretty good at this.|Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren’t acting Christian enough.
Hey!!! Oww!! And I’m bleeding.|Oh! Oh! Oh!
Okay, great.|Wow! And I’m a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I’m sorry, we’ll put some ice on it.
Okay.|‘Kay, put your head back.
All right. I can’t see.|All right, I have ya. Oh God.
Hi Daddy!|This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
You remember Ross.|Um-hmm.
Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.|What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
So, Dr. Green, how’s the old boat.|They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
It gives it a nice antiquey look.|Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
Wow. I’m sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.|Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
Okay!|Aw honey stop! It’s not that bad.
Yeah.  Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must’ve added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.|Yeah. That’s Daddy.
That’s Daddy?! But doesn’t it bother you? You’re a waitress.|Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I’d be serving him sneezers.
So?|So. Ross, I’ve bugged him about this a million times, he’s not gonna change.
You really serve people sneezers?|Well um, I don’t.
Thanks again, Dr. Green.|All right.
Oh, ah, you don’t need that.|Why not?
The carbon, it’s messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.|What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it’s a sickness really.|Yeah it is, it is.  We really, really have to do something about that.
I know.|Excuse me, you think I’m cheap?
Nothing I do means anything, really.|This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I’ll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I’ve never been able to cry as an actor, so if I’m in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let’s say I wanna convey that I’ve just done something evil. That would be the basic ‘I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it’  And that’s how it’s done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.|Hey, Mr. Trib.
Hey-hey.|Guess what, I got an audition!
Awww, one of my students got an audition. I’m so proud.|I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
You bet! What’s the part?|Oh it’s great, it’s a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
You had to do it, didn’t you? You couldn’t just leave it alone.|Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there’s a bug in my food.
Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.  Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.|Yeah, I’m gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
Um. yeah.|I am soo dead.
All right, look, here’s the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I’ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.|Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn’t work.
Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that’s why you have got to be the bigger man here.|Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn’t make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say ‘Like me! Like me tiny doctor!’
Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?|Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.
Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don’t wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!|Okay, okay, okay.  I’ll get the bagels.
What’s this?|Isn’t it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
This is not the bed I ordered!|I know, you must’ve won like a contest or something!
Why is this car in my bedroom?|I’m sorry, okay, I-I wasn’t looking, and the store says that they won’t take it back because you signed for it...
When did I sign for it?|When I was you! Y'know what, it’s all Joey’s fault, ‘cause he left his nose open!
Did you make brownies today?|Knock, knock.
Quick, take off your dress, he won’t notice the bed.|Hey, I’m going for sushi does anybody want..  Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that’s not gonna be me, not me.|Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
No.|Whoa. That was really good.
You told him to play the boxer gay!!|Well, I-I might’ve said supergay.
You totally screwed him over.|Joey, you’re this guy’s teacher. I mean how could you do this?
Hi Daddy.|Baby. Ross.
What? What? He’s interested in you. He-he likes your hair, he just wants to know how you got here.|Oh, please. Sweetie it’s hopeless, okay, I’m just gonna go.
What?!|Look, look I’m sorry. It’s just that....
He’s got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...|You’re still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn’t get into medical school in Extapa!
Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.|Uh.
Well that’s his last name.|And his first name.
It’s Robert Bobby.|Oh.
And um, excuse me, he helps me.|Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
With my alignment. I’ve got one leg shorter than the other.|Oh God!
What? It’s true, my right leg is two inches shorter.|Come on! You’re just titling!  Her legs are fine!
I’m sorry, let her?|What can I do, she doesn’t listen to me about renter’s insurance either.
No.|Well what if somebody steals something? How are you gonna run after him with one leg shorter than the other?!
Yeah honey, I’m standing right there! Why didn’t you just tell him about the mole I haven’t got checked yet.|Excellent!
Uh, may I help you?|Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I’m the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
Look, it’s like I told you, there’s nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.|All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
Nobody sees the king!|Oh-ho-kay, I’m talking to the king.
Hey! You can’t go back there!|Oh my God.
Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?|I will have one.
Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!|Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend ‘Albino Bob’.
And all these people actually died?|Yes, while I was in the chair! That’s why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it’s not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
Thanks, Gunther.  Umm, can I get a napkin too?|Oh, like you don’t already have everything.
No, no he’s not.|You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?|Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It’s like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.|Well, I’m going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
What did they do?|Well, they painted over the word ‘Sapien’ for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let’s just leave it at that.
Hey-hey, Ross?|Yeah.
I’ve got a science question.|Hmm?
If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact ‘Homo-sapien’, is that why there extinct?|Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he’s bored.|Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here.
Who’s so brave, you’re so brave, yes you are, you’re so brave.|Okay. Okay honey, he’s fine, he’s fine, let’s just put him down. Come here, Ben.  How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
He’s not gonna say anything, because we’re not gonna tell him.|We’re not?!
No we’re not.|All right, I like that.
Okay.|So we’re okay, we’re okay, we’re okay,  aren’t we? No, we’re not okay, we’re not okay, there’s a bump, there’s a bump.
Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!|I cannot push it in!
Okay, we’re gonna need a distraction.|Okay, okay, okay.
I got it!|Okay.
The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go,  rweee!!|Or. We could put a hat on his head.
A hat! Yes! We need a hat.|We need a hat..
Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?|Oh, oh, oh, I’ll get ‘Rainy Day Bear’!!
Because he’ll know what to do?  Oh my God, you’re a genius!|Oh God, oh God, it’s sowed on though.
Give it. Give it.|Okay.
Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?|I’d really prefer a mountain bike.
Janice’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.|Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
That’s a good idea, ‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday’. I would like to get her something serious.|Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
All right. Look, I’m gonna go in here, and you don’t buy me anything ever.|No, no, you can’t, you can’t, okay, you can’t, you can’t buy her pearls, you just can’t, you can’t, you can’t.
Why not?!|Oh God. Uh, okay, here’s the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
What is the thing?|Okay. I went down to the ‘Mattress King’ showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
What?|They were in his office.
Well she, she wouldn’t do that, she’s with, she’s with me.|I’m telling you man, I saw it.
Yeah, well, you’re wrong! Okay, you’re wrong.|I’m not wrong! I wish I was. I’m sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn’t sound so bad now, huh?
It just makes more sense as an ensemble.|Right.
Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.|No! Oh! You’re alive! You’re alive!
Sure, we have no money, go ahead.|‘Hey! You’re not dead! Okay, see ya!’
Oh my God! He just said my name! Did you hear that?|Monica bang!
Did he just say ‘Monica bang’?|Uh-huh.
Oh my God! He’s gonna rat me out!|Monica bang!
Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It’s no big deal, it’s not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben.  Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn’t that fun?|Okay, I’m stopping now.
You okay?|Oh yeah! Y'know, if it’s not a headboard, it’s just not worth it.
How’s my Bing-a-ling?|Ah, I don’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
Why are your eyes so white?|You tell me! Maybe, it’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
Oh my God!!|All right!
How did you know?|Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
In the park?|No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
Just those two!|Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
Oh, I’m sorry honey, I’m so, so,  haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can’t breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?|Here.
The receipt.|I’ll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me?
I don’t know.|Okay. If you’re alive you answer your phone!
Okay, Ben, I won’t tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don’t tell about our little bonking incident.|Monica, number one, I don’t think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I...  What?!
Oh that’s right, that’s what I’d sound like if I exploded.|Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.|Well maybe he’s just taking a nap.
Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?|Yeah.
Well, now we got a reason.|What?
Well, we’re fashioning a very long poking device.|All right.
Hey uh, what’s a matter?|I talked to Janice.
Oh my God, is she going back to him?|She doesn’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
What are you ah, what are you gonna do?|I don’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
Well, it doesn’t matter what I would do.|Come on, tell me.
All right, you’re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out.|What?  What are you, what are you talking about?
Well, he’s finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?|Are you, are you, are you sure it’s ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I’ve always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
It’s okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.|I did!
I know! I’m saying you have to watch them all the time.|I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
Monica?|Yeah.
Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?|No. Why?
Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he’s leaving out ‘e’ and ‘f.’ It’s like they just ah, I don’t know, fell out of his head.|Really?!
Oh, and also, he’s, he’s walkin’ kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he’s in there just sort of y'know...|Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
Monica bang! Monica bang!  Ow!|I’ll get the hat.
Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it’s, it’s, it’s not gonna be easy.|Okay.
I think you should go back with Gary. I don’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know ‘You’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.’ and I hated that guy. And it didn’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.|Wow!
Yeah, well. It’s the right thing to do.|Oh! You’re right. Oh God. But, before I can say ‘good-bye’, there’s something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it’s like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie’s been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it’s like movie love, you’re my soulmate, and I can’t believe we’re not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
Then don’t leave me!|What?
Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!|No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I’ve got to give my marriage another chance.
No you don’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.|
Ohhh. Don’t go.|No, I-I-I gotta go.
No. No! No! No!|Honey, honey, people are looking.
I don’t care!  I don’t care!!|Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now.
You can’t leave! I have your shoe!|Good-bye Chandler Bing.
All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.|Can we please focus here, a naked man’s life hangs in the balance!
All right, ladies and gentlemen, let’s poke.  Thread the needle. Thread the needle.|He’s alive! He’s a-live!!!

Well ah, you wanna just stay out there?|Can I see that for second.
Okay. Hut! Hike!|Fumble!
Uh, hello, the buzzer buzzed. It doesn’t count.|After the snap!
Before the snap!|After!!
Oh Pheebs, that’s great. It doesn’t count.|Does so count!
Cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.|Oh my God!
Oh-ho, okay.|Dead leg!!
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay, fine, fine! All right, you wanna win by cheating, go ahead, all right. Phoebe the touchdown does count, you win.|Woo-yay!!
Okay, first of all, I don’t play with cheaters, and second of all, you know I had swollen glands!!|Y'know what? I’ll think you’ll play.
Because the winner gets this!|The Geller Cup.
Okay, where in the hell did you get that?!|When Mom and Dad drove you to the hospital to get your nose fixed, I swam into the lake and fished it out.
That cup is mine!|No it’s not! You want it, you’re gonna have to win it!
Chandler! Chandler!|Hi.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s with the tackling?|What?! I just touched him and he went over.
Hey, where’d you get that?|I went really long.
It’s no surprise that your winning, ‘cause you got to pick first, so you got the better team.|You’re so pathetic! Why can’t you just accept it, we’re winning because I’m better than you.
What?! The guys against the girls? See, that’s ridiculous Monica, because I’m only down by three touchdowns.|Oh, then bring it on! Oh, unless of course your afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.
Fine, fine, Rachel your with Monica, Joey you’re with me.|I can not believe your trading me!!
The game is over, we eat now?|No-no-no-no, the game’s not over, we’re just switching teams.
Oh, my.|Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let’s play some ball, guys.
Which do I like?|Yeah, y'know for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill...
Well, if I had to chose right now, which by the way I find really weird, I would have to say, Chandler.|Yes!!
I’m sorry, Joey, that is my chose.|You hear that! That is her chose, mister I’ll let you have her! I win! You suck! I rule all! A mini-wave in celebration of me!!
I’m now thinking I would like to change my answer to, no one.|Wh-what?
I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.|Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.
We have to do this. We are playing for women everywhere. Okay, just think about every lousy date that you ever had, okay, every guy who kept on the TV while you’re making out...|Oh my God! You dated someone with a glass eye too?!
Come on, okay, come on this is for all womankind. Let’s kill ‘um!|Yeah!!! Kill ‘um!!!
All right, we still have a minute and a half to go, and we’re down by two points. Two points....  Phoebe you do a button-hook again. Rachel, you go long.|No! Come on! Don’t make me go long. Use me. They never cover me.
Honey, there’s a reason.|God, I’m not lame, okay. I can do something. I can throw, would you let me throw, come on this is my game too.
All right Rachel, you sweep behind, I’ll pitch it to you, you throw it down field to Phoebe. All right. Break.|Thank you! Break!
Thirty-two! Seventy-one! Hike!|One-Mississippi! Two-Mississippi! Three-Mississippi!
No! I’m not okay!|I’m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn’t know what to do.
Come on! Come on! Hurry! We’re running out of time! Huddle up!|Okay. Oooh! Oh, this is our last huddle, yeah.
All right, Phoebe get open. Rachel, go long.|Okay.
Break!|I got a touchdown! We did it!!
Let go! I’m a tiny little woman!!|Guys! Guys! Come on! It’s Thanksgiving, it’s not important who wins or loses. The important thing is,  the Dutch girl picked me! Me! Not you! Holland loves Chandler! Thank you, Amsterdam! Good night!!
We should defiantly play football more often. Maybe there’s a like league we could join or something.|Isn’t there a national football league.
Oh shoot! I work Monday nights.|Umm, this stuffing is amazing. Do you think we should bring them some?
Let go!|No! You let go!
No!|How come it’s always us left in the field holding the ball?
I don’t know. I guess the other people just don’t care enough.|Hey! It’s starting to snow.
Eh..., I don’t, I don’t know.|What?
Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?|Rachel?
So that’s two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.|Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
You broke a little girl’s leg?!!|I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...|I’m gonna get back to retraining.
...and after you’ve delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....|Gunther, Gunther, please, I’ve worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
What if you put them here.|Huh. Well, y'know that’s actually a really good idea, because that way they’ll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
They already do. That’s why they call it the ‘tray spot.’|Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I’m, I’m sorry.
So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don’t have to sell those cookies anymore.|Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?|Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he’d be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.|No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he’s gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?|The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
Yeah.|So far, I’ve sold seventy-five.
Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able.  How much are the boxes?|Five dollars a box.
And what is second prize?|A ten speed bike. But, I’d rather have something my Dad couldn’t sell.
Well, that makes sense.|Could you do me one favor, if it’s not too much trouble?
Yeah, Sarah, anything.|Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don’t have a TV, the lady across the alley said she’d push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
Yesss?|Hi, I’m selling Brown Bird cookies.
You’re no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.|No, hi, I’m, I’m an honorary Brown Bird
What does that mean?|Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I’m not invited to sleep-overs.
I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!|No, please, please, um, it’s for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
I’m pressing, a policeman is on his way.|Okay, okay! I’m going. I’m going.
I can still see you!|All right!!
Hey.|Hey. What, what are you doing here?
Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah,  oh, but oh...|Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
Destiny.|Sure.
Yes.|All right.
Okay.  Yikes! That one doesn’t look very fulfilled.|Oh, that’s, that’s ah, one of the old ones, he’s just taking it to the back.
You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.|Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
So, what happens to the old guys?|Well, they go into the chipper.
Why, do I have a feeling that’s not as happy as it sounds?|
...and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.|All right, I’ll take a box of the cream filled Jesus’s.
Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I’m trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I’m putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?|Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
Mon?|All right, I’ll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that’s it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds.  Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I’m sure that’s not gonna happen this time, why don’t I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph’s.|No.
Oh, come on, now you know you want ‘em.|Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t do this.
I’ll tell you what Mon, I’ll give you the first box for free.|
And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don’t just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.|I’m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
Rachel?|Yeah.
Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.|Can’t I just look at the handles on them?
You would think.|Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I’m a terrible waitress? Because, I don’t care. I don’t care. I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do. So I don’t think I should do it anymore. I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.
What?!|Gunther, I quit.
....and 12, 22, 18, four...  What?|I spelled out boobies.
Ah, we’re out. I sold them all.|What?
Monica, I’m cutting you off.|No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it’s no big deal, all right, I’m-I’m cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.|
Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!|Oh my God, how did you do that?
Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as ‘Laser Floyd’ was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That’s when it occurred to me, the key to my success, ‘the munchies.’ So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'|Okay, stop what you’re doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?|Me! On my computer.
Well you sure used a large font.|Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
Sweetie, calm down, it’s gonna be okay.|No, it’s not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don’t have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I’m just gonna, I’m just gonna call Gunther and I’m gonna tell him, I’m not quitting.
What, that wasn’t the great news?|Only if you think it’s better than this...  snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it’s a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.|Looks good. I’ll take it.
Yeah, the ah, trees that don’t fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.|I-I think I’m gonna look around a little bit more.
Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.|Hey, guys. I’m here to pick out my Christmas tree.
Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?|I’m not gonna tell you! You’re the bad man who broke Sarah’s leg.
Hey now! That was an accident, okay.|You’re a big scrud.
What’s a scrud?|Why don’t you look in the mirror, scrud.
I don’t have too. I can just look at you.|All right girls, and man. Let’s see your final tallies.  Very nice.
Not nice enough.|Charla, 278. Sorry, dear, but still good.
Good for a scrud.|Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
That’s crap!! Sister Brown Bird.|Who’s next?
Hi there!|Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.|Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
Hey! How’d the interview go?|Oh, I blew it. I wouldn’t of even hired me.
Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.|I can’t! It’s too late! Terry already hired that girl over there.  swans.
Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.|Oh! Oh my God!
It’s like ‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.’|Oh thank you! I love you!
Sure, everybody loves a kidder.|I got the job!
Here we go. I’m serving my last cup of coffee.|Should I tell her I ordered tea?
I’m, I’m sorry you didn’t get to go to Spacecamp, and I’m hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle’s Private Very Special Spacecamp!!|Really Mr. Geller, you don’t have to do this.
Oh come on! Here we go!  Stand by for mission countdown!|Okay, Blast off!
Okay, pick a card, any card.  All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?|Um-mm.
All right, give it back to me.  5 of hearts.|Real magic does exist.
I can’t tell you that, no.|Ah, somebody’s at the door on the ceiling.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I’ll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn’t see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.|Oh, I got it.
Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?|Honey, what’s the matter?
I just saw Janice.|Oh.
Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid’s pretzel at them.|Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.|Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
Oh, y'know what, I’m gonna be okay, you don’t have to throw a party for me.|It’s Joey’s birthday.
Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.|Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
How’s that coffee comin,’ dear?|Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
I’m not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.|I know!
I’ll bet your thinking, ‘What’s an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?’ Eh?|Op.
Eh.|Oh, you got me.
Well, don’t think I haven’t noticed your potential. Well, I’ve got a project for you that’s a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?|Oh, that sounds great.
Come on over here, sweetheart.|Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.|I know honey, I’m sorry.
Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it’s remotely related to the field they’re interested in.|Gee, I don’t know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?|I’m sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
It’s not funny, this is actually my job.|Oh believe me, I-I-I’ve been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
Oh well then, so I’m just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.|Ah, just one other thing.
Yes?!|I ah, I work at Bloomingdale’s and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
Hey guys.|Hey Gunther. Hi.  I mean you’re going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
So, he’s just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn’t want anything in exchange for helping him?|Well, I assume I’ll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that’s true of any job.
Yeah.|Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he’s actually going to kill you dead.|Okay! You don’t think I thought of that?
I mean, was it Gina?|Which one is Gina?
No, no, no, that’s Dina.|You see you can’t tell which one is which either, dwha!!
That was me.|Look, when I’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I’m sorry.
That’s okay.|That’s all right.
Y'know which one was she again?|Why don’t you ask Chandler, ‘cause he’s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin’ over Janice by groping my sister.
Did he call? Did Mark call?|No honey, I’m sorry, but the weekend’s not over yet.
Oh.  Oh my God, is that Phoebe?|I guess they’re back from their date.
Music. Very nice.|Oh my God!
So, how are you?|I am good. I finished my book.
Oh yeah, what’s it about?|I don’t remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How’s it going. This is the hardest letter I’ve ever had to write.  What the hell’s a matter with you? How do you think Joey’s going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?|Well, that’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I’ll be in Cuba.
All right, look, look, you’ve got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.|What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?|Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
I’m here to see Mary-Angela.|You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, ‘cause my Grandma doesn’t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
Where’s Mary-Angela?|She’s right in there.
I can’t believe Mark didn’t call. It’s Sunday night, and he didn’t call.|Bummer.
Yeah, right. Look at you, you’re practically giddy.|No, I’m genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn’t work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
Yeah, and you don’t mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.|That’s right good things, that-that is what I said.
He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.|That is so made up!
I got the interview!|Yay!
He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.|Oh, that is amazing!
I got to figure out what I’m going to wear.|High collar and baggy pants say I’m a pro.
Yeah! Right! Okay, I’ll see you guys later.  Woo hoo!|You go get ‘em.  What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?|No! I did!
Well, it’s, it’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?|Of course! It’s her favorite.
So um, Mary-Angela, what’s your second favorite?|More of Grandma’s teramisu.
Would you just please....give me the receipt ‘cause this is great. It’s top notch.|That dies with me.
So will I.|Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn’t mean anything.|Just do it.
Hey!|Finally, I thought we’d never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
Look, I may have jumped the gun here.  Um, I just got out of a relationship and I’m not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.|So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
Ahhhh, you’re not Mary-Angela.|No, I’m Mary-Theresa.
This is so bad. If-if you’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?|I am!
Oh, this is soo bad.|Joey!!!
No Joey! No Joey! Don’t Joey! Joey!|What’s goin’ on?
You’re it! Now run and hide!|It’s no big deal. Chandler was just kissin’ me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
I wasn’t sure which one Mary-Angela was.  Look, I’m sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.|I say, punch him Joey.
Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother’s not going to punch me.  Are ya?|Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you’d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.|So what. I say, punch him.
Okay, absolutely!|All right.
You’ve got it.|Cookie, now you can punch him!
Hey!|Hi!
What are you doing here?|Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
Oh.|Hi.
Hi.|How’d did it go?
Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn’t shut up.|I’m so proud of you.
Me too!|Listen, I’m ah, I’m sorry I’ve been so crazy and jealous and, it’s just that I like you a lot, so...
I know.|Yeah.
Yeah.|Rachel?
Yeah.  Hi Mark!|Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
Oh, I did!|Yes.
|Congratu!!  -lations-lations.
So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?|Oh well y'know.
Yeah, I do know.|Ick, you were eavesdropping.
Y'know if it’s any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.|May I help you?
Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?|Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
Tell him.|It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.|Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.|Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.|Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing.  Is this actually a lunchbox?|Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
Oh.|Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and,  What am I gonna do?|Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings!  Don't cry outloud.
Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.|What?
Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.|Who?
...and the style number, and the invoice number, and the shipping date. Good. Any questions so far?|Yeah. What kind of discount do we get?
Twenty percent.|Oh!! I love this job!  Wow! My first call.
Here, let me.  Rachel Green's line, how may I help you?|Hi, is Rachel there?
And who may I say is calling?|This is Ross?
Ross of.....|Of Ross and Rachel.
Oh hi. It's, it's Mark.|Oh hey, hey Mark.
Hey, hold on a second.|Okay.
All right, I just got changed in thirty seconds so you can be alone with him. You'd better go for it.|Please, I'm not going for anything.
Well, if you don't, I will.|Would you please go?
Night Mon. Night Julio.|Adios.
you've got to pick a pocket or two..........|Lovely, just lovely.
Really? Thanks.|Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
Excellent, I'll be there.|Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.|Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!|Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
Oh no, no, no, no.|What, what is that?
All right, I have to get that, but no-no.  So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?|Hi!
Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.|Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
To yourself.  Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.|Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
Bye-bye.|Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
What, what, what?!|What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look,  'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
You really think that is what he meant?|Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?|Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...
Wh-what's that?|It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.|Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!|All right Ross!! I get it!!
I mean my God...|You're hurt!
...can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!|Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
I would never do that!|Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
Mark's a genius!|Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'|He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.|
Mark!!|It's okay, Rachel knows.
Yeah, but even soo.|I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.|So, does that mean the audition is off?
Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.|What?!
Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!|It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
Have fun.|Bye.
Hey!|Hey.
What are you wrapping?|Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
Yeah, it's a vase.|Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
Well not exactly like the one in the poem.|What do you mean?
So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?|What?
Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.|Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't even know me...|Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
What?|The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...|No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
No, no, no. What was that?|I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
Well, people!|People, people, people.
So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?|Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got.  See, she's fully dressed, right?
Right.|And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and
Hello.|Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
A big idiot.|A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?|Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.|I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
Where ya going?|Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
Ohh, with who?|Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
There was a woman at the...  The stripper?!|Yeah.
You have a play date with a stripper?!|Man, I gotta get a kid.
Sure, is she married?|Ahh, no.
Oh.|Are you jealous?
Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?|You are totally jealous.
I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...|Honey, I love you too.
Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.|What?
Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.|Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
Is there a Julio here?|I am Julio.
you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.|Your no God's gift to women, that's all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch.
Hi.|Six dollars, please.
Six? I just had it for one night. It’s three.|Eight o’clock is the cut-off and,  aww, it’s 8:02.
Y'know in a weird way, you have too much power. Look, you’re gonna have to help me out here, ‘cause I only have three.|I can help with that.
Oh my God. Richard?  Hi!|Hi!
Wow! Your lip went bald.  Hey, thanks.|So, you look great.
Right.|No you do. You... just...
What?|You’ve got panties stuck to your leg.
That’s because I-I was just grabbing some things out of the dryer, and it’s static cling. Or maybe it’s just that God knew I’d be running into you and saw an opportunity.|It’s good to see you.
You see that guy? He’s in classics now, but y'know as soon as we leave he’s going straight to the porn.|He’s gonna go up to the counter with Citizen Kane, Vertigo, and Clockwork Orgy.  This is nice.
Yeah.|I missed this.
Me too.|So, you wanna get a hamburger or something?
Oh, um, I don’t know if that’s a good idea.|Oh. Look, just friends, I won’t grope you. I promise.
No, I just I think that it’s too soon.|No it’s not too soon, I had lunch at a eleven.
Yeah, baby!|What are you doing?
Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?|No thanks. I’m 29.
Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now she’s celebrating that by going on a date with him.|It’s not a date, okay. I’m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.
Hey.|Hey.
Do you have any ice?|Check the freezer. If there’s none in there, then we’re probably out. Are you just getting in from work? It’s late.
Yeah, I know. I had the greatest day though, I got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from Calvin Klien. I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it. How was your day?|I discovered I’m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue.
Hmm.  Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?|Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.
But ah, you’re safe from it if it’s in the freezer?|Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we’ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.
How often do you read it?|Haven’t you ever read the same book over and over again?
Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that’s a classic, what’s so great about The Shining?|The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it’s way better than that classic of yours.
Okay. Ah, well we’ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining,  and you will read Little Women.|All right, you got it.
All right.|Okay.
Okay.|Ah, now Rach, these ah, these little women.
Yeah.|How little are they? I mean, are they like scary little?
Um, Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.|Oh, hey.
. That’s okay, it’s mine, we just kissed.|Oh.
I’ll have coffee.|Yeah, me too.
So when people complement me on my cooking should I, what do I say?|You say ‘Thank you very much,’ and then you buy me something pretty. Come on, we’re gonna put are hands in this bowl, and we’re gonna start squishing the tomatoes.
Ew, this feels very weird.|You touch people’s eyeballs every day and this feels weird.
Yeah, well, sure I touch them, but I spent years learning not to squish them.  That’s my hand.|Oops.
Okay.|Gotta keep squishing.
Tomatoes are squishing.|Okay.
Op.|Oh, gosh, you got some on your shirt.
Yeah.|Hold on a second, just put a little club soda on it  and it should umm, be.....
What?|Umm, you’ve got some on your pants.
These little women. Wow!|Your liking it, huh?
Oh yeah! Amy just burned Jo’s manuscript. I don’t see how he could ever forgive her.|Umm, Jo’s a girl, it’s short for Josephine.
But Jo’s got a crush on Laurie.  Oh. You mean it’s like a girl-girl thing? ‘Cause that is the one thing missing from The Shining.|No, actually Laurie’s a boy.
No wonder Rachel had to read this so many times.|Hey!
Hi, I’m Joey, we haven’t met.|Ah, good to meet you. Robert.
Hey Robert, could you ah, ha, pass me those cookies?|Sure.
Yeah, I do think it’s better this way.|You really sure?
So we can be friends who sleep together.|Absolutely, this will just be something we do, like racquetball.
Sounds smart and healthy to me. So um, just out of curiosity, um, do you currently have any other racquetball buddies?|Just your dad.  Although that’s actually racquetball. You know I-I do have a blind date with my sister’s neighbour next Tuesday.
Oh.|You want me to cancel it?
No!  No!|Okay.
‘Cause if you do that means you’d be cancelling it for me, and we’re just friends.|Exactly.
Hey.|Hey. Ooh! Don’t sit down!
You ready to go to the batting cage?|Yeah. And, first here’s a gift.
Oh! Wow! Hey!|Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!
Jeez, thank you really that is so nice. But um, to be honest, I don’t think I can wear these, they’re so tight, I feel like I’m on display. I’m sorry.|That’s all right, that’s well, I figured....
Hey!|Hey!  How’s it going?
Oh, there they are! I-I dropped my keys.|Oh my....
Hi.|Sorry. I’m sorry.
What are you smiling at?|I’m sorry, I was just thinking you’re day could still pick up.
Yeah, right.|Hello.
Listen, Robert’s gonna be here any second so, will one of you just tell him?|Oh.
Please, right now, no, every time I see him it’s like ‘Is it on the lose?’ ‘Is it watching me?’|We can’t tell him, you can’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff.
Hey.|So are ready for the gym? They’ve got this new rock climbing wall, we can spot each other.
No, I can spot you from here.|What?
Okay, listen Robert...|Hey, don’t we have to...
Umm, I think you’re really, really great...|Oh God! Here we go again. Why does this keep happening to me?  Is it something I’m putting out there? Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?
I-I-I-I-I don’t know, I don’t know what to say.|Hey buddy, this is a family place, put the mouse back in the house.
Ow!|Really?! Well, it’s just like everyone else’s apartment. It’s got rooms, walls, and ceilings.
Oh my God! Oh my God!|Ah well, this is the living room.
So um, who was she?|Oh,  that was the blind date that I told you about, she called and switched it to today.
Did you like her? And I’m just asking as a friend, because I am totally fine with this.|Well, you seem fine.
Y'know what, what if we’re friends who don’t see other people?|You mean like exclusive friends?
Why not?! I mean this has been the most amazing week. Would it be so terrible? Even if we were friends who lived together. Or, maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends, and vowed to be friends forever.|Wow. Y'know we’re back where we were. Honey, I would love to do all that, but nothing’s changed.
That’s not true, you don’t have a moustache.|Okay, okay, one thing’s changed. But we still want different things and we know how this is gonna end.
Y'know what, I’ve got to walk out of here right now, ‘cause getting over you is the hardest thing that I have ever had to do. I don’t think I could do it again.|I know I couldn’t. So....
Watch the thorns!|Ow!!
What?|Beth is really, really sick.
Awwww.|Jo’s there, but I don’t think there’s anything she could do.
Joey?|Yeah.
Do you want to put the book in the freezer?|Okay.
‘Cause every time I see your face, I can’t help but fall from grace. I know.....|Wow! This girl is good.
.|Okay, see, see, everyone else is happy she’s done.
Okay, my next song’s called: Phoebe Buffay, What Can I Say. I Really Loved When We Were Singing Partners, And I Shouldn’t Have Left You That Way.|Oh no, one of those ‘look for the hidden meaning’ songs.
Hey Phoebe.|Hey Leslie, how’d you know I’d be here?
Someone in there?|No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called ‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.’
Where’s Chandler?|Ah, he can’t make it, he said he had to his...
Hi.|Hi, sweetie!
Hello.|Hi, Ross.
Yeah, huh.|I’ve got some bad news.
What?|I can get a quick bite to eat, but then I have to come back up here.
Come on sweetie! You’ve had to work late every night for the past two weeks, what is it this time?|Actually, it’s kinda my fault. I-I quit today.
Oh hey, but that’s sad about you though, what happened? Burn out? Burn all out, did ya?|Nooo, he’s leaving for a better job.
Oh well that’s great, so I guess this is ah, this is good bye then. Huh?  Good bye.|Okay, then.
Okay.|Well we’re gonna miss you around here.
Oh.|Y'know those are a delicacy in India.
Yeah, that was Leslie calling again to see if we can get back together. That’s the twentieth time today! And good luck Leslie!|Wow, she must have hurt you pretty bad, huh?
Well, yeah. Y'know, we were best friends, ever since we were little, our Moms worked on the barge together.|Oh, you two must have been so cute running around on a barge.
You never run on a barge!|Hey.
Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!|I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should’ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.
Well, that’s the best kiss I’ve had with anyone I’ve ever met in a men’s room.|Actually, me too.
Op, foot in a puddle, foot all in a puddle.|Oh damn, I hate that.
Yeah, we’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes.|Oh, don’t worry about it.
No, really you’re gonna freeze.|No, I’m not.
You’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?|Some day, maybe.
Funny book?|Hmmm. Oh, no, no, I just thinking about something funny I heard today. Umm, Mark, Mark saying ‘I’ll see you Saturday.’
Yeah, at the lecture, I told you that last week, you said you didn’t mind.|Oh, no, no, no, it’s-it’s not the lecture ah, I mind, umm....
Oh, please tell me it’s not because I’m going with Mark.|Oh, well...
Oh my God!!! Ross!!|Well, I’m sorry, but ah, look if you’re not working with him anymore, why do you have to still do stuff with him?
Because, he’s my friend.|Okay, but do you really need another friend? I mean...
Okay, well if I stop playing with Joey and Chandler, can I play with Mark?|Is that funny? Am I supposed to be laughing?
I don’t know, you thought ‘See you Saturday’ was funny. Look honey, Mark is in fashion okay, I like having a friend that I can share this stuff with. You guys would never want to go to a lecture with me.|Pa-haa!! I would love to go with you.
Really!?|Yeah, hey I-I have clothes, I even pick them out. I mean for, for all you know I could be a fashion..... monger.
Okay. Honey, I would love for you to go with me.  What?|What should I wear, now I’m all nervous.
Y'know they say a watched pot never beeps.|It’s just y'know, been a couple of hours, and she hasn’t called. Not that I even care, y'know.
Phoebe why don’t you just call her? You obviously want to.|You think you know me so well.
Well, don’t ‘cha wanna?|Yeah.
Okay, well I do know you.|That’s what I said.
Well so?|I can’t. I can’t. She dumped me, I mean I totally trusted her and then one day it was ‘Okay, bye Pheebs’ gone. Y'know what the saddest part is, when we were playing together, that was like the most fun I’ve ever had in like all my lives.
My best shoes, so good to me. I wear them everyday. Down at the heel, holes in the toes. Don’t care what people say. My feet’s best friends, pals to the end. With them I’m one hot chicky. Though late one night, not much light, I....|I stepped in something icky.
We’re beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colours. For instance a sheer navy blouse over a pink....|You’re so pretty. I love you.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat, smelly cat, it’s not your fault.|Wow, that’s great.
Oh, yeah!|Y'know you could totally sell this. It’d be perfect for like umm, a kitty litter campaign.
I..., a jingle? No, no-no-no, no.|What? Why not? You could make a ton of money.
Okay, well if I was in this for the money, I’d be a millionaire by now, y'know. You just got to get out of that jingle head sweetie.|Aw, you’re right, you’re right. I’m sorry.
Hi!|Hey.
Oh, can I borrow this?  My milk’s gone bad.|Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car.
So umm, how was your date with Ginger?|Great. It was great. She’s ah, she’s great, great looking, great personality, she’s greatness.
Sounds like she’s got the ah, whole package.|Joey told you about the leg, huh?
Uh-huh.|Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldn’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I don’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often it’s like ‘Hey, y'know what, where’s your leg?’ I mean I’m the smallest person in the world aren’t I? I’m the smallest person in the world.
So I nodded off a little.|Nodded off!! Ross you were snoring. My father’s boat didn’t make that much noise when it hit rocks!
Come on! Forty-five minutes! Forty-five minutes the man talked about strappy backed dresses.|Well okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium listening to Professor Pitstains and he’s ‘Hey everybody! Remember that thing that’s been dead for a gazillion years. Well there’s this little bone we didn’t know it had!’
First of all it’s Professor Pittain! And second of all, that little bone, proved that, that particular dinosaur had wings, but didn’t fly.|Okay, see now, what I just heard: blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah-blah-blah, blah-blah-blah, blah, blah.
Y'know what, 100 million people went to see a movie about what I do, I wonder how many people would go see a movie called, Jurassic Parka.|Oh, that is so...
No-no-no, a bunch of out of control jackets take over an island.|Y'know if what I do is so lame, then why did you insist on coming with me this morning? Huh? Was it so I just wouldn’t go with Mark?
No. I... I wanted to be with you. I don’t know, I feel like lately, I feel like you’re slipping away from me, y'know. With this new job, and all these new people, and you’ve got this whole other life going on. I-I-I know it’s dumb, but I hate that I’m not a part of it.|It’s not dumb. But, maybe it’s okay that you’re not a part of it. Y'know what I mean?  I mean it’s like, I-I-I like that you’re not involved in that part of my life.
That’s a little clearer.|Honey see, it doesn’t mean that I don’t love you. Because I do. I love you, I love you so much. But my work it’s-it’s for me y'know, I’m out there, on my own, and I’m doing it and it’s scary but I love it, because it’s mine. I, but, I mean is that okay?
Your thinking about my leg aren’t you?|No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?
It’s okay if it bothers you. Really. I mean the only thing I need to know is: ‘How much it bothers you?’ because I don’t like wasting my time. Am I wasting my time?|No. No. I don’t think so.
What’s that?|That’s-that’s my nubbin.
What’s a nubbin?|It’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing.
You have three nipples?|Well, y'know two regulars. And ah one that barely qualifies as...  Ahh, what?
Nothing. I, I just remembered I have to leave.|You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?
Oh, I thought you weren’t coming. What? Where were you?|Come here, come here.  Okay, don’t get mad, okay.
Okay, don’t give me a reason to get mad, okay|I played Smelly Cat for the people at my old ad agency, they went nuts.
No, look, I told you that I didn’t want you to try and sell it, and you just, you big fat did it anyway. God, y'know what, I think five years ago I probably would’ve done anything to play with you but, I can do it by myself. And if I can’t trust you then just forget it.|No, no, I don’t want to forget it.
Problem odour in the litter box? Don’t change your kitty, change your kitty litter.|Sorry, Pheebs.
Well hello!|Where have you been?
The doctor.|Is everything okay?
Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting.|Wow! It’s like Rachel in High School.
Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?|I won’t give you anything, but you’ll owe me 2.95.
Done.|Hey. I need an atlas! I need an atlas!
So Pheebs what’s this guy like?|Umm, well he’s very dashing, y'know, and umm, very, very sophisticated, and he doesn’t speak any English, but according to his translator, he totally gets me.
Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?|Yeah! You wanna come?
Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!|Can I help you?
Uh-oh.|Uh, y'know what, we’re having second thoughts about our copying needs. And we’ll need a little more time to think about it.
Okay, that hurt us.|Hi guys. I haven’t seen you since this morning.
Well ah, ........y'know.|Hey, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
|He’s says, ‘Walking with you makes this strange city, feel like home.’
See there it is right there.|Wow! It’s small.
Yeah. But Sergei said it took the Germans six weeks to get all the way across it.|So you had fun, huh?
Yeah. Except for, y'know when you’re on a date and you’re getting along really great but the guy’s translator keeps getting in the way.|No.
Anyway, I’m going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator’s date? So that when we, it’s time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he’s really, he’s kinda cute.|Yeah, well kinda cute, like really kinda cute, or kinda cute like your friend Spackel Back Larry?
Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?|Uh, 10:30.
What time is it now?|4:30.
Yeah all right, so we’ll hang out.|Yeah. Hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?
Yes. Vividly.|She was kidding about that right?
Yeah, I-I-I think so.  Yeah, I-I think so...|God, that would be weird it that situation presented itself tonight, huh?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?|Dude, I don’t know.
She was kidding.|Yeah.
She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.|Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don’t want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don’t want to be seeing.
Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....|Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we...  be?
Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.|Yeah, I guess, but what’s like heads and what’s tails?
We’re holding.|Hi!
Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?|Well you said you couldn’t go out so....
Ross honey, this is very nice, but, but I-I got a crisis.|Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
Honey, honey, I’m sorry, I know it’s our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don’t have time to stop.|Okay, you don’t have to stop, I’m invisible, I’m not here.
But I don’t, hmm...  Get me Mark on the phone!|I love Mark.  Do you know Mark?
Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for|Pepper?
None for me.|Okay sorry, whew.
I’m sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I’m sorry but that’s...  Oh my God!!|Okay, that’s a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
What are you doing?|I’m sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody’s off the phone, how ‘bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
Ross you’re not listening to me, I don’t have time to stop.|Come on Rach, you don’t have what, ten minutes?
I don’t have ten minutes!!|What?  Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don’t!|Don’t yell at me okay, this is the most I’ve seen you all week.
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I’ve got a deadline, would you just go home, I’ll talk to you later.|Yeah, but wait...
Good bye!|Actually, that’s our three hole punch.
Hey.|Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.|I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?|You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody’s work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.|But I told you, I didn’t have the time!
Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.|Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
No, but it’d be nice if you realised, it’s just a job!|Just a job!
Yes.|Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...
No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.|Well neither do I!
Is this about Mark?|Oh my God.
Okay, it’s not, it’s not.|Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.
Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.|I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break,|No.  A break from us.
Hi, Ross.|Oh, hi Chloe.
I want you to met some friends of mine.  This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don’t do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say ‘let’s Ross it!’|And that’s the only colour that comes in.
Oh!|So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?  Why? What did I say?|Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.|Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
I’m also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.|Oh, really.
Well, I was having a conversation.|Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven’t been able to say two words to each other.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?|That would be great. Thank you.
Hello!|Oh, hi. It’s Mark.
Oh.|What? Is it my breath?
No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!|Hi. Well, look, I was just gonna leave a message, isn’t tonight your, your big anniversary dinner?
Yeah. Well, umm.....|Rach, are you okay?
Yeah, I’m fine.|You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
No! Really, no, please, please, that’s, that’s okay.|All right, all right, I’m coming over, and I’m bringing Chinese food.
Oh, yeah, I’m not, I’m not hungry.|It’s for me.
So what are you gonna do?|What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.|Why? What happened to him?
Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.|Wow. I’m sorry. Eggroll?
No.  And then I called him, and he wasn’t there.|Well, then he’s, he’s probably just, out.
Hello.|Hi! It’s me.
Hi! Oh, I’m so glad you called.|Really? I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?
Nobody.|Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
Yeah! Got it!|Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
Ah, that’s okay, thanks.|Hey, you don’t have to smile. You just have to dance.
Look, I don’t feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?|Oh, okay.
And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.|Oh.  Can I have a tissue?
Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.|Well, tell him, apology accepted.
You silly diplomat, why don’t you learn some English, Sergei?|Excuse me, but umm, isn’t he paying for your dinner?
I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.|It will be my pleasure.
I like this song.|Well, you’re practically dancing already. Why don’t you just do it over here?
Oh, no, no.|What? Are you married? ‘Cause that’s okay.
Ameri-ccan.|Ameri-can.
|Previously on Friends.
I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.|You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?
Is this about Mark?|Oh my God.
Okay, it’s not, it’s not.|Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
Fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break,|No. A break from us.
Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don’t want to take a break.|I’ve been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don’t, don’t you think we can work on this?
Nobody.|Is that Mark?
Umm, honey, look he just came over to....|Yeah! Got it!
Hey.|Hey.
How’s the big anniversary dinner?|Well, we never actually got to dinner.
Ohhh, nice.|No, we kinda broke up instead.
What?!|God, Monica it’s on the ceiling.
That’s okay, this is more important than fruit  on my ceiling! You broke up?!|Yeah, but it’s okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
Oh no!!|No.
Rachel, you and Mark?!|No, no-no, it’s okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
Hi, it’s me. I’ve been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.|Yeah!!
Eh, I’m just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don’t want to get back together over a machine.|Na-huh.
So, I love you.|I love you.
And y'know what, I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I’m gonna stop by around 8:30.|Okay.
Bye.|Chloe, Chloe how’s it coming?!!
Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.|Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?|Yes, you can, very much.
Hey!|Hey.
Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?|Oh, there’s banana on it.
Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.|So then you know?
The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.|Oh, good. Thanks.
Now what is Fabutec?|Okay, all right don’t judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
Waxine!!|Yes! Have you seen it?
Oh, it’s incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.|I know!!
God. Do think it really doesn’t hurt? ‘Cause how can they do that?|Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
Oh my God! Oh my God!|Yeah. We figured when we couldn’t find you, you’d gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?|What?! Look, we’re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
He’s right. Nobody’s gonna benefit, and you’re just gonna hurt her.|Yeah, and there won’t be a relationship left to rebuild.
All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing’s right. And that’s what deathbeds are for.|Yeah, okay.
After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,|Did that!
Grasp one of the linen strips by its ‘easy grab tab’ and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.|Okay.  Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
Was it not pain-free?|No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don’t seem to think it’s that bad.|That’s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don’t believe me, please, by my guest.
Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!|Now, are you glad we didn’t start with the bikini strips?
Chloe? Hi..|Is this about me taking your watch?
You took my watch?|I’m sorry, I do that.
Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?|Oh no. I feel it isn’t really anybody’s business, y'know.
Exactly. So you didn’t, didn’t mention anything to Issac right?|Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven’t actually met...|You dog!
Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.|Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
Yeah, that’s the one. Listen, I don’t want to hurt her.|Oh, hey, man I know, doesn’t matter how much we love ‘em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?|Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We’re the same, you and me.
Actually, no, we’re not.|Yeah, we are.
No, we’re not.|Yeah, we are.
No, we’re not!!|Okay, we’re not.
Right.|But, we are.
Fine. I just need to know that you’re not gonna tell your sister.|I can promise not to tell her again.
Jasmine?|Uh-huh.
We met at Phoebe’s birthday party, I’m, I’m Ross Geller.|You did a bad thing!
Yes, I did.|Very bad!
Very bad.|Very, very bad.
I’m agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?|No.
Okay, Jasmine, please, please don’t. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?|All right.
Thank you, thank you.|But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.|I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?
Ow!|Oh!!
Ow!! Ow!!|Ow!!!
It’s okay, it’s okay.|We’re all right.
We were just waxing our legs.|Off?!!
I can’t talk to you. I can’t even look at you right now!|What?
Just get away from me!|No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
Oh my God.|Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
Oh!!  You guys knew about this and you didn’t tell us?!|He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!|No!!
Just get out! Now!!|No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
What?|Was she good?
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?|She was...
Awful! Horrible!|She was not good. Not good.
Ewwwww!|Uh-oh.
Good different?|Nobody likes change.
Should we do something?|Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
I’m sorry, okay, I’m sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.|Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave?  Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!|And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
Look, I didn’t think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.|We were on a break!
That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.|You think you’re gonna get out of this on a technicality?
Look, I’m not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!|Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
Y'know what, I don’t think we should listen to this anymore.|What, what are you doing? You can’t go out there.
Why not?!  I’m hungry.|Because they’ll know we’ve been listening.
God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!|Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn’t happen!
Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.|Yeah, we’ll be fine.
Don’t you realise none of this would’ve ever happened if I didn’t think at that same moment you weren’t having sex with Mark?|All right. Let’s say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
Yes I would.|You’d be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
Yes.|You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
What? Come on Rach, tell me what you’re thinking?|I’m thinking, I’m gonna order a pizza.
Oh man, pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.|We could eat the wax! It’s organic.
Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I’m kinda hungry myself.|Fine.  Hi! Yes, I’d like to order a large pizza.
No anchovies.|With ah, extra anchovies.
That’s okay, I’ll just pick ‘em off.|Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
You can have the last piece, if you want.|Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
They’re gonna get through this, aren’t they?|Yeah, come on, it’s Ross and Rachel, they’ve got too.
Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah, okay.|Hey. It’s three in the morning. They don’t know that I’ve come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
Y'know what, y'know what, I’m-I’m not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You’re the one that bailed on us. You’re the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!|That’s....
That’s what?!|That is neither here nor there.
Okay, well here we are. Now we’re in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail?  I just can’t see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.|No Ross!!  Don’t! You can’t just kiss me and think you’re gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn’t work that way. It doesn’t just make it better. Okay?
Okay, okay, okay.|I think you should go.
What?|I really think you need to go now.
Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn’t work past it together...|Yeah, what the hell did I know!
Look, look, there’s got to be a way we can work past this. Okay,  and, and....|it doesn’t matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It’s just changed, everything. Forever.
Yeah, but this can’t be it, I mean.|Then how come it is?
They’ve been quiet for a long time.|Maybe she killed him?
Is that your new walk?|No, I really have to pee.
Can I see the comics?|This is the New York Times.
Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?|We are. He’s meeting us here.
No! Rachel is meeting us here.|Oh come on, they can be in the same room.
Okay, let’s go!! Let’s hit the road!!|Hey!
Let’s get the show on it!|Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.
Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it’s sooo close.|Closer than here?
Is he here?|No.
Oh.  Here’s your moisturiser. Hi!|Hey!
You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five tickets, Calvin Klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me.  Okay, I said that out loud right?|Yes, yes, it’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross.
Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.|No, it’s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he wants y'know, us to check it out.
Hm-mm.|Yeah, he’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine.
Ohh!|We’re sorry honey.
Oh, it’s okay.|Rach, it’s, it’s ah, it’s not that we don’t want to, really.  Are we talking models in their underwear?
And heels.|Ross, did ask us first, and we set that night aside.
Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.|Oh yeah.
Chandler what are you doing?!|Chandler!!
Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?|Look, I’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place.
Oh that’s great, with my luck, that’s gonna be him.|Him? Him, Ross?
Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism.|Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing. Huh? I’m asking you first, right?!. I mean I’m playing by the rules.
Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can cut glass over here!|Wait. Really?! ‘Cause mine get me out of tickets.
It’ll be great for next weekend.|No, no, no, this weekend guys!
It’ll be great for next weekend. I mean,  it’ll be grrreat.|What’s going on?
Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your grandmother’s cab, but y'know what, I’ll stay.|Noo! I’ll stay. He’s my brother.
Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?|Why? Do you think he’s still mad at us?
Chandler!!|What?
What does the sign say?|Beam me up Jesus.
No, the ‘No Smoking’ sign. There’s no smoking in my Grandmother’s cab.|Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.
Please!|No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.
Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.|What?
Okay.|Ow!
Aren’t you gonna go?|No. Thank you.
No, y'know what don’t close it  ‘cause the... keys...are in there.|Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!
Damn!  The tailpipe’s not hot enough to light this!|Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?
Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning.|So, if you’re parents hadn’t got divorced, you’d be able to answer a question like a normal person?
Ladies, ladies, let’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off Monica’s bra.|All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.
Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right there.|Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us.
Chandler!!|At least let me smoke it to the good part.
Okay.  Oh, no!|What, what’s it, what’s going on?
Yeah, this has happened before.|So you know how to fix it?
Hi!|Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here?|Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of M*A*S*H and half the hostages coming home?
Ah yeah, but now it’s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home.|Where’s Ben?
He’s sleeping.|Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?
Umm, yeah, actually, Susan’s gonna be home any minute, it’s kinda an anniversary.|Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?
It’s not that kind of anniversary.|Ah!  Oh.
Sooo!! Anyway...|Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. ‘Cause you know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so Rachel and I broke up.
Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.|Yeah, well.
Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?|Oh yeah, I’d love that.
Oh, great! Me too.|I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job.
Okay, yeah.  Triple A can pick us up.|Great!
Yeah, what town are we near?|Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?
Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route we’re on?|Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.
Okay.  Okay, either 93 or 76?|I don’t know, I’m sorry, I always slept in the back when we drove up here.
Okay.  Yeah, no they don’t do that.|Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.
But if...|No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you’ll have to think of something else.
So the going for help went well?|Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.
Then why are you smoking?|Well it’s very unsettling.
....right? Right? I mean it’s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don’t, I don’t need them, huh, I’ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.|Ah, Susan will be so pleased.
Hey, you’ve have more of these for Susan right?|No. But it’s okay, I’ll just put out pickles or something.
Ross, thank God.|Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?
|Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don’t know where we are, so we can’t get a tow truck.
Okay, done.|What’s ‘pleh’?
That’s ‘help’ spelled backwards so that the helicopters can read it from the air!|Huh. What’s doofus spelled backwards?
Ugh!!!|Oh, it’s Ross on one of his drives!
What is he doing here?!|He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I’m stepping on some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I’ve got plenty of people to help on the Interstate.
Arrrghh!!|Oh no, now it’s not gonna make any sense!
Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?|I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?
I-I can’t handle this, you guys.|Y'know what, I can handle it, handle’s my middle name. Actually it’s the ah, middle part of my first name.
What?|Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.
Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do. No-no-no-no.|Guys, guys, guess who I am?!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!  You don’t, all right you don’t have to love each other, okay? You don’t, you don’t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.|Yeah, and not put us in the middle.
Yeah, otherwise, I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just it for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want?  Can you be civil?|Yeah.
Okay. Good, all right, let’s get back in the car, ‘cause it’s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.|Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who’s going with who?
Maybe we can like go to a movie or something.|Okay.
Or, or the rodeo!!|That would be great.
Okay!|I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
Ross!|Hi! Sorry I’m late. Were you sleeping?
Ahh, nooo!!|Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the best one I could, ‘cause that’s not where you want to skimp.
You’re a genius, Ross.|Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even 110?
Okay, I’ll pay you tomorrow.|Okay.
Okay, bye!!|So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go, y'know?
Yeah, okay, bye.|So I’m gonna take off then!
What’s so funny?|Oh, nothing, no. It’s an acting exercise, I’m practising my fake laugh.
Oh.|What-what’s so funny?
Here you go.|Oh, y'know what, I didn’t want cinnamon on this.
Sorry.|Hi!
Exactly, it’ll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.|Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
And so now you guys are gonna be married?|Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I’ve only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.|Well, that shouldn’t be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
Pete, can I get you something else?|Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you’re given’ ‘em out.
Haven’t you and I covered that topic?|Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you….
Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.|Well, if that were true, I’d dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward.  Come on, you think she should go out with me, don’t you?
I mean really, think about it.|Ho-ho, I will.
No, I know, I know, that this is Frank’s life,  y'know. Y'know, I don’t want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it’s sick and wrong!|Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
No-no, oh, I’m fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it’s tongue down my little brother’s throat!|Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
But, I mean, do you think he’s gonna enjoy it when he’s up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank,  and it-it’s not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it’s not good home economics.|Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
Yes. Not out loud.|Pheebs, if you don’t tell him, soon he’s gonna be married, and then you’re gonna hate yourself.
Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he’s gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can’t.  But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.|No-no-no-no-no.
Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!|No.
Okay, I’m gonna go get Frank.|So, we’re walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let’s go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let’s just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
I think you should definitely go out with this guy.|Nah, he doesn’t do anything for me.
Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?|Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids….  All right, I get your point.
All right.|Hi.
Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?|Y'know what, pretty good.
Yeah?|Good! I haven’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
Thank you.|Here you go.
Hey Mon, let’s give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.|What check thing?
We use it!!|There you go!!
Oh my God, Monica’s gonna go out with a millionaire.|I’m not gonna go out with him.
Oh my God, I can’t believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.|Or incredibly offensive.
Oh yeah, sure, that too.|What?
All we’re saying is don’t rush into anything.|Yeah, come on, think about it. You’re 18, okay, she’s 44, when you’re 36, she’s gonna be 88.
Yeah, he-he’s right, he’s right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you’re young, you’re-you’re weird, chicks dig that.|Okay, but isn’t sex better when it’s with one person that you really, really care about.
No the man’s right, that’s what I had with Rachel.|You don’t have it anymore?
No, I ah, I slept with someone else.|Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
It didn’t.|Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I’ve got with Alice.
Yeah, yeah.|Why can’t I find that?
Don’t ask me, I had it and I blew it!|Well, I want it!
Oh, no! No!|It’s out there man! I’ve seen it! I got it!!
You’re Frank’s best man?!|I couldn’t help it, there love is so pure.
Well then,  what about you?! Huh?!|I’m the ring bearer.
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I’m so glad you could come, ‘cause I’ve got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.|Oh my God, who died on this?!
Yeah, I know. It’s a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?|Absolutely. Okay, first we’ll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn’t work we can go back to…
Y'know what, forget it. It’s ruined.|Oh no-no, never say that. If we can’t get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
Okay, that’s great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.|Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in.  Hi.|What the hell is this?
Hang on a second.  I’m sorry what?|Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
Well, y’know, I never know how much to tip.|You’re supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what’s-what’s the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
You’re taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn’t leave you that tip, you wouldn’t of come down here, we wouldn’t be having this argument, and there wouldn’t be this ah, heat between us.|What?!
Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. ‘Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we’re like this-this couple that fights.|Okay, umm, you’re a loon.
Look, forget the check, okay.  I like you. I think you’re great. Come on, what do you say?|I don’t know.
Why not?|‘Cause I don’t want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It’s-it’s me!|Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I’d curl up in it. Is that all right?|Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
Oh, well just probably the worst one since I’ve been alive.|What umm, what happened?
Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.|Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don’t see how I could all of the sudden be too young, ‘cause I’m older than I was when we first got together.|Yeah, yeah, no, I don’t, I don’t know. But, y'know what, maybe it’s just all for the best?
Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!|Oh, sweetie, oh.
Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it’s still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it’s, and now it’s gone and I don’t know why!|Uh, well I can tell you why. It’s, it’s because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
What?|Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn’t be together, y'know. And you’re gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?|Okay.
Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn’t want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.|Okay, but.
Oh my God! The millionaire’s here!|
Hi!!|Hey!
Just one drink?!|So, where do you want to go?
You’re, hey, you’re not paying for the pizza!|Oh come on, it’s only fair, you paid for the flight. Now is, is that enough lire?
Ahh, I’d throw another thousand on that.|Why, how much is that?
Every night!!|You do not need to smoke. Cigarettes don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.
Hey, Frank. Look, okay, I know that you think I did like this totally evil thing, but I so didn’t. There’s someone here who can explain this better than I can.|Hi Frank.
Yeah, but not just that.|Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less…
None the less.|None the less. Umm, you’re too young to, to really know what you want.
Cigarette’s don’t control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke.|And you also want to buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
Here you go.|Thank you.
Say Rachel, I was wondering if you’d like to go to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you’d just like to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.|Hi!
...so y'know, that’s why, within a few years, that voice recognition is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be like-like, ‘Wash my car.’ ‘Clean my room.’ It’s not gonna be able to do any of those things, but it’ll understand what you’re saying.|Oh, this is so great.
Yeah, it was.|All right then.  Bye.
Joe. How’s it going?|Good.  Hey.
Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.|I know.
What, so what are you gonna tell him?|Well, I told him I would think about it, but I’m gonna tell him no.
Huh.|I mean I think I’d say no to anybody right now.  Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I’m standing there with this charming, cute guy, who’s asking me to go out with him, which I’m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I’d be cheating on Ross or something.
Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you’re not over Ross yet and you have issues with your father.|I don’t have any issues with my Father.
I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and whenever I can’t do it, they’re all like-like laughing at me.|Hello.
Wow, what-what do you think she wants?|Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me.... a-sucks.
Hi.|Hi!
You ah, wanted to see me?|Yeah. Ahh, here’s a box of your stuff.
What?!|Oh, y'know, it’s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD’s, just sort of stuff that you’ve left here.
What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?|No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it’s time we-we y'know, move on. I mean, I mean don’t’ you think?
Yes.|Yeah?
Yes, I do.|Good.
Yeah, I-I really do.  Hey! This-this was a gift?!|Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.
It’s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!|Okay, all right, give me the mug! I’ll keep the mug.
No!! Y'know-y'know don’t do me any favours. In fact, where, where’s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm,  Hey, this book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I’d like that back too. Yes, I do.|You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that T-shirt!
I’m just trying to help you, move on.|Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....
Petty...|Petty...
Small...|You are so just doing this out of spite.
Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!|Huh?
I’m-I’m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!!|You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn’t even fit you anymore!
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...|yeah-yeah-yeah!!
So, you’re like a zillionaire?|And you’re our age. You’re our age.
Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name it after yourself.|What like Pete Dakota?
Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.|Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?|Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin’. You look at me, and it’s nothin’.  Nothing.
I have a question about this scene.|Yes?
Well, I don’t understand why Adrienne’s attracted to Victor.|Peel the onion. First of all, he’s good looking.
I think my character’s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.|Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it’s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don’t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you’re a bitch.
It doesn’t say that in the script.|It does in mine!
I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn’t matter, I still wind up with this little  cowlicky thing on the middle part of my head. It’s so annoying. Does it bug you?|You bug me.
Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! You’re gonna get peep eye!|I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she’d say no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!
You didn’t just break up.|Hey, it’s been like three weeks!
You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!|Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight, I’m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can’t, I can’t watch this.  Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go, she’s going in.
Okay.|She’s going in. Wait! He’s going in! He’s going in!! The door’s closed! I, I can’t see anything but the door closed!!
And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.|Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!
Stop what?!|I don’t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will do it. I’ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!
No!! You can’t!!|Look, they must be stopped!
I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!  You are surprisingly strong!|I need juice! People need juice!!
Look man!|People need juice!
Listen to me!!|Juice, I need...
She’s moving on! Okay, if it’s not this guy, it’s gonna be somebody else! And unless you’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? It’s over.|Yeah, okay.
Okay.|It’s just I miss her so much.
Why do all you’re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?|Oh. That’s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is missing, she can be like, ‘Where’s number 27?!’
No. And I don’t think I’m gonna want to.|I can’t do this.
Yep. Yep, that’s what I didn’t want to know.|Well, oh, Mark, I’m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know? I’m just doing it to get back at Ross. I’m sorry, it’s not very fair to you.
Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch. Right here!|Oh God. I’m sorry about this.
That’s okay.|You sure?
...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...|Hey, can I ask you something?
And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.|One second.
Uh-oh, what did she do now?|Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she’s like the greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!
Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.|God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, ‘Oh, I’m so talented.’ and ‘Oh, I’m so pretty,’ and ‘Ooh, I smell so good.’
I think somebody has a crush on somebody.|Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?
I’m talking about you. You big, big freak.|Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, you’re out of your mind.
Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard you’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!|Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual scenarios and stuff huh?!
Happy?! Is that what I’m supposed to be Vic? Happy?|Well, why don’t you tell me what you’re supposed to be! Huh? Because I sure as hell can’t figure it out! I talk to you and it’s nothin’. You look at me, and nothin’.  Nothing.
Well, that was ah...|Better?
Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G’night.|Ah, Kate?
Yeah?|You ah, you forgot your shoes.
|Hey, listen you ah....
Hmm?|...feel like getting a cup of coffee?
Umm.|Kate?
Yep.|You ready to go?
Yeah.|
So umm, I’ll see you tomorrow, huh?|Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.
Why isn’t it Spiderman? Y’know like Goldman, Silverman...|‘Cause it’s-it’s not his last name.
It isn’t?|No, it’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there’s no Gold Man.
Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!|Hey!
So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?|Okay well, he would turn things to gold.
What about things that are already gold?|Ahh, his work is done.
Okay, let’s play my game now.|Okay. All right you yellow-bellied-lilly-livered-DRAW!!
Wait a minute, wait. You’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn’t want you back?!|Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what it’s like to be you?
Hey, Sophie!|Hey, Rach!
Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn’t have to walk me all the way back up here.|Oh, that’s-that’s okay, no problem.
Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don’t keep the women’s lingerie here in the office?|Yes, I realise that.
Summer catalogue!|That’s the stuff!
Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice.  Hello! You don’t work for me.|Joanna.
Bing! That’s a great name.|Thanks, it’s ah, Gaelic, for ‘Thy turkey’s done.’ So ah, I’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
Me too.|Bye, Chandler.
So ah, what’s wrong with him?|Oh, nothing, he’s just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?|No!! No! He’s not married, or involved, with anyone!
Oh, Rachel,  actually, y'know what, forget it.|Well, I’ll ask him for you, if you want me too?
Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?|Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper’s a little faded, that’s okay. Carpet’s a little loose. Hardwood floors!!|Hey!
I know!!!|So, I’m here, ready to play.
Okay.|I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
What’s this?|That’s a dog, every house should have a dog.
Not one that can pee on the roof.|Well, maybe it’s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
I don’t want a ghost.|Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you’ve got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that’s it, that’s it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They’re not the right size, they’re not Victorian, and they just don’t go.|Okay,  fine. Come dinosaur, we’re not welcome in the house of no imagination.
Hey, Kate!|Morning.
Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...|Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...|Hi, oh, I’m Lauren, Kate’s understudy.
Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.|I know! I-I’m a big fan of yours.
What?!|I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
Get out of here, really?!|Absolutely!
Yeah?|Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
They gave me the shaft all right.|Oh, you’re so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
Well Ahh,  yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.|Cool! I-I’ll see you then.
All right.|All right, it’s time to act, my talking props.
Hey!|Hey!
Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!|Wow!!
Look, look!|Hey, what’s this?!
Oh, okay, it’s the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.|It’s very interesting, Phoebe.
The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.|This is the coolest house ever!!
Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?|All right!
Watch, watch.|Ooohhhh!!
And, and!|Ahhhh!!
Chandler is fantastic!!|What?!
Oh God, we just clicked! Y’know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?|Oh, I....
Oh, and he’s got such a good heart! Doesn’t he have a good heart?|Oh, I know...
Oh, I know and he’s soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.|Isn’t this great?!
|That guy’s like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
Come on baby, don’t go. Please? What do you say?|I’ve got no reason to stay.
Hey, it’s gonna be all right.|Hey! So since we’re getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
What?|You know! At the place I told you about last night?
Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.|Oh, okay.
Okay.|I’ll see you tomorrow.
Ah, are you okay?|Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
I don’t know.|Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
How do you mean?|Well, Adrian’s looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can’t just kiss her, he’s gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
Maybe he could slip her the tongue.|Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.|And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!|And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
Something like that?|Yeah, that’s pretty much what I had in mind.
Hey.|Hi.
No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.|Ohhhhh!
Oh, it was so amazing. After the  love making...|Oh my.
Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming ‘cause, ‘cause her eyes keep going like this.|I’m telling ya, Joanna’s got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, ‘This was fun. Let’s do it again sometime. I’ll give you a call.’
Did he call?|No. Sorry.
Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?|Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?|Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?|Well...
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?|No. I...
Call her! Call her now!|Multiple, so many paper cuts.
Why hasn’t he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don’t understand. Why? He said he’ll call. Why? Why? Chandler I’m telling you she has flipped out, she’s gone crazy!|Oh, well give me the phone then.
Come on, this isn’t funny. She thinks it’s my fault that you haven’t called her. You have to call her!|Look, you can’t call somebody after this long just to say, ‘In case you didn’t notice, I don’t like you!’
Well then you’re going to have to take her out again.|Nooo!! She’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
I don’t care! I don’t care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it’s actually ended. And, I don’t care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!|All right! Fine! But it’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
That’s fine!|That’s just a lot of big talk, y'know.
Mon?|I’m in the shower!
Hey.|Hi.
So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?|About what?
Y'know, about what happened with us.|Nooo. And there’s really no reason he should find out, so ah let’s not make a big deal about it, okay?
What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can’t tell me last night didn’t mean something to you. I-I was there, you’re not that good an actress.|Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That’s all it was. Joey, I’m-I’m sorry you feel bad, but haven’t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
Nooo.|Hi, Kate!
Hi, Lauren.|Hi, pig!
Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.|Oh, that’s okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
Yeah.|Hey!
Well, we believe it originated here.  In the Aroma Room.|All right. Did everyone get out okay?
No Phoebe, don’t look! You don’t want to see what’s under there!!|Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
It’s not a big deal. It’s, just it’s right here,  and it’s all the time.|Well, thanks again for lunch.
Yes, this, this was pleasant.|It was, wasn’t it?
The food there was, was great.|Wasn’t it?
So take care.|You too.
Well, this was great. I’ll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.|Great! I’m looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
Noo!|Chandler!!
Look, I’m sorry. Okay? I’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry.|Okay, you are going to tell her and you’re going to tell her now.
Ahhhh—I’m not going to call you.|What?
I’m sorry. I’m-I’m-I’m sorry that I said I was going to when I’m not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn’t Rachel’s fault. It’s me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy,  mascara goop. And I’m really sorry, it’s just that this is not, this isn’t going to work out.|Well, this isn’t how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
Yeah, o-okay.|So...
So who’s idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?|Oh, some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.
Oh my God, are you guys okay?|Are you all right?
Hey.|Hey. Y'know with that goatee you kinda look like Satan.
Oh, so that’s why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.|Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy’s theory. Okay?
Hey.|I’m gonna be on TV!!
No way!|Yeah! They’re putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they just found in Peru and The Discovery Channel’s gonna film it!
Oh my God! Who’s gonna watch that?!|Thanks. You ready to go?
Yeah.|Saw a girl with that vest.
Thanks.|Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
Hi!|Hi! Hey, Pete you’re back! Hey, check this out.
Wow! Skates!|Wow! You’re a lot sturdier that Chandler. He crumpled like a piece of paper. So how was you’re trip?
Well...|Oh, what’d ya bring me?!  Awww, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh, these are gonna go in my permanent collection. You want some coffee?
Yeah, sure, that’d be great.|Regular or decaf?
Ah, which ever is closest.|Okay.
So ask me what I did today.|So what did you do today Pete?
I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.|What?! Oh.
Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?|What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica’s Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues.  But Pete’s just doing this because he has a crush on me.|And you’re still not attracted to him at all?
Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can’t. I couldn’t even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.|Yeah, but Mon that’s totally different. He was you’re health teacher.
What? Honey.|Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
Oh God, I’m so sorry.|I know.
Oh God!|Hey, you guys! Guess what?
Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders.  Ross! Ross! I’m kidding!|Yeah, come here!
What-what was it you were gonna tell us?|Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.|Umm, oh, about three months.
Okay, so I guess that’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.|Hey!!
Hey!|I got you something! Open it! Open it!
Okay.  It’s a chicken.|It’s cute, huh?
Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.|Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot’s and lot’s of love.
So? I mean have you thought about it?|Okay. Here’s the thing.
Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What’s the thing?|I can’t do it. I’m sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
Wait, wait, wait, wait, that’s-that’s what you’re worried about? If that’s the problem, we’ve got no problem.|Huh?
No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.|Oh?
Her name’s Ann, she’s a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.|Oh, that’s great! I mean I’m-I’m sorry, but I’m so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
I guess you can.|Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh!  All right, y'know what? I’m just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
All right.|Okay.  Can you give me a little push?
Yeah, sure. Good luck!|I’m okay!! I’m all right!!
What?|I’m just saying, this woman, I mean she’s fictitious. No?
Why would you say that?|‘Cause you’re still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so ‘cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
You’re good. You’re good!|Yeah, no, I’m fairly intuitive and psychic. It’s a substantial gift.
Listen, can you promise me that you won’t tell her though?|Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
Thanks a lot.|No I’m serious. I mean I’m intuitive, but my memory sucks.
Okay, but this is the last time. -chickeeeen.|Hey.
Hey.|How’s she doing?
She?|Well yeah, don’t-don’t you think it’s a she?
I don’t know.  I can’t tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.|Well, anyway, I got to go change, I’m ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
Excuse me?|What?
I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!|Hey! Who was up from 2 o’clock this morning until 5 o’clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
You don’t think I get up when you get up?|Ohhh, here it comes.
Yes, here it comes! I’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don’t think so mister!|Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
And you don’t think taking care of our chick is work?|That’s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick, we’ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?|I don’t know, maybe we weren’t ready to have a chick.
I’ll take her back tomorrow.|Do you think we’ll get our three bucks back?
Hey!|This blue suit, or this brown one?
|Wow! That aspirin dance really works!
Oww!|Oh my God, is that still...
I’m fine, I’m fine.|No you’re not.
Yes I am!|Rach!
Look, I’m fine. Watch.  Whoa-whoa!|Okay, okay. Look, you have got to go to a doctor! Okay?
No. I have got to get ready and go to a dinner at my bosses house. It’s a very big deal, there’s a lot of people there I have to meet.|And I’m sure you’re gonna make a big impression. Hi! I’m Rachel Green. It’s nice to meet you.  Come on, you probably have a broken rib!
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow, it’ll still be broken then.|Rach...
But y'know, I could use a hand getting ready.|Rachel...
Look, either help me or go.|Fine. I’ll go.
Okay, but before you go, could you help me first?|Sure. I’ll help you.
Y'know what? I cannot do this with my left hand! Would you please, help me with this too?|Ohh.
|Okay. This stuff?
Yeah.|All right.
Careful. Light. Okay, do you know how, just sweep it across the lid. Okay? Just sweep it.|Oke-dokey.
Oh-ho!|Sorry.
Hey! That’s just poking me in the eye!|Sorry, I’m sorry. Close, close, close...
Okay, just sweep it.|I’m sweeping...
Right.|Sweep, sweep....
Okay, now make it even, ‘cause we don’t...|What? What?
We don’t want it-it to be too much, we want it to be subtle.|No. No, y'know you don’t, you don’t wear enough of this.  What?
Since when, since when do you think I don’t wear enough of this?|Well I, close your eyes, I just think you’re gonna like this a little better, ‘cause, close-close...
Blow it.|Sorry. ‘Cause umm, I think this will make you a little more sophisticated.
Hey!|Hey!
Hey, guess what I’m doing tonight.|What?
I’m checking out the restaurant with Pete.|Ohh, Monica, I am so excited for you.
I know.|Ooh, I have to tell you something.
What?|But I can’t tell you.
Okay, but wouldn’t it be easier if you had to tell me something that you could tell me.|Well, sure in a perfect world. But, no, I promised I wouldn’t tell, and I swore to like all my gods.
Okay. Does it have to do with Ross and Rachel?|No.
Does it have to do with Joey?|No.
Does it have to do with-with Chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?|No, but let’s come back to that later!
There you go! Good enough for your party, huh?|Sure.
Yep?|Sure, I’ll just sit next to the trans-sexual from purchasing.
Okay, come on! All right, I gotta go! So good luck at the party. Okay?|Oh wait, Ross, would you just stay and help me get dressed?
Sure, okay.|Okay. Okay, great! Umm, okay, just turn around.
What?|I don’t want you to see me naked!
Rachel, I’ve seen you naked a million times. I ate hot fudge off you naked. Remember, I-I sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your belly button?|Yeah, but that was different. Y’know? I mean, we were, we were going out then, now I think it’s weird.
Rach, y'know I can see you naked any time I want.|What?
All I have to do is close my eyes. See?  Woo-hoo!!|Ross! Stop that!
Ah, I’m sorry.|Come on! I don’t want you thinking of me like that any more!
Ahh, sorry, nothing you can do about it. It’s one of my ah, rights as the ex-boyfriend.  Oop, oh yeah!|Stop it! Cut it out! Cut it out!
Okay, okay, I’m sorry, it will never happen...  Uh-oh! Wait a minute! Wait-wait, now there are a hundred of you and I’m the king.|Rosss...
Come on, would you grow up? It’s no big deal.|All right.  Fine.
Yowzah!!!|O-kay!! See what you did, I’m gonna be doing it by myself now. Okay?

Okay.|I really do.
Okay, I’m gonna get your coat and then I’ll-I’ll put you in a cab.|Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you’re not gonna come with me?
Of course I am. I just have to make a call.|Okay.
Okay?|Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
What?! I wh-, what’s wrong?|I’m sorry, I just can’t go to the hospital lookin’ like this.
Does it involve travel?|Noo!
Does it involve clogs?|Oh, wait, wait. Clogs, or claws?
Clogs.|No.
Claws?!|No.
Okay, so it doesn’t involve Ross or Rachel or Chandler or Joey. But, what about Pete?|No!
What is it?! What about Pete?|I don’t know!
Okay, I feel like I’m talking to Lassie. All right, Phoebe would you just tell me!|I can’t!!
Okay, I gotta go.|I, but you’re so close! No!
Okay, does it involve something to do with Pete’s computer company?|Oh, just go. You’re never gonna get it!
I know. See, yes. That’s Yasmine Bleeth, she’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways.|Hey!
Hey!|Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
If they can’t find a home for her, they kill her! And I’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!|Okay, good, good, good, ‘cause, good, ‘cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
Okay. And it’s not just chicks y'know? It’s all kinds of other animals!|That’s horrible! Well, you did the right thing man.
I don’t believe this! Wow, look at this refrigerator! It’s gigantic! I mean I could live in this thing! I’d be cold, but I’m always cold. Oh my God, look at these spider burners! I love spider burners.|So you like it?
Oh, it is sooo perfect. Thank you so much.|Oh, you’re welcome.
Did you just smell my hair?|Nooo. Uh-huh, no way. What? No.
Oh God.|What?
You still have feelings for me don’t you?|Now, nooo! I’m just excited about the restaurant, that’s all.
Pete.|Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?
No, it’s not bad. It’s not bad at all. It’s-it’s really nice.|Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I’m okay with that.
You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That’s why I can’t take this job.|What?
And well, we probably shouldn’t see each other anymore. I’m sorry.|Okay, yeah. I mean... If that’s, if that’s really what you want, okay.
Okay, bye.|I’m sorry things didn’t work out...
Okay, you’d tell me the truth. Right?|Rach, you can’t look fat in an x-ray.
Okay.|Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!
What thing? What thing?|Nothing, ah there was this thing at the museum. Come on.  Easy.
What thing? What is this thing?|I was kinda, supposed to be on TV tonight for The Discovery Channel.
Oh my God!|Yeah.
Ross, why didn’t you tell me that?|Eh, ‘cause I knew that if I told you, you’d make me go, and I knew you needed someone to be with you tonight. Come on. Come on.
I cannot believe you.|What?
That is the sweetest thing, I just....|You should get some sleep.
Okay.|So, I’ll umm...
Oh, I’m sorry I spoiled you’re evening.|No, that’s, no, as long as you’re okay. So I’ll ah, I’ll see you tomorrow.
See ya.|What did you do?
What ‘cha doing?|Having a swim.
What about the chick?|Chicks don’t swim.
Are you sure?|I don’t know. Should we try it?
Sure.|See, I told you they don’t swim.
Wait. Give him a minute.|Noo!  Oh, it’s okay, it’s okay, baby, baby, baby.
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold? I was supposed to call my Dad back like two hours ago.|Oh, yeah, he clipped on, he said call him as soon as you get a chance, he’s at Flimby’s.
What’s Flimby’s?|Oh, yeah, that’s the word I use when I can’t remember the real thing.
Okay. Hang up! That’s it! Come on!|No! Rachel, that’s what they want me to do. My warranty expires tomorrow, if I don’t get through, they’re not gonna fix my crappy, broken phone for free! We cannot let them win! It’s us versus them!
No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so…|But you said one.
I meant, me plus one!|Okay.  Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?
Okay, bye-bye!|Bye!
Okay, I need a date!|Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!

Uh-huh.|Okay.  Wait! One second! Just…
Phoebe?|What?! Monica, I’m scared!!
All right. Honey, that’s-that’s a sleeve. Okay?|Yeah.
And! We also have speaker phone.|Please, stay on the line. Your call is important to us.
Okay, wait, you gotta hang up ‘cause we’re gonna be late.|Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.
Of course not.|No.
Hey, hey Rach!|Oh, hi!
Hi!|How are you?
Good.|Hey.

Yay!!|Oh! Tommy, this is Ross. Ross, Tommy.
And! Break!!|Okay, uhh, I think I’m going to run to the ladies room.
Okay.  So uh, well, this-this is uh, this is awkward.|Yeah?
Well y'know ‘cause Rachel and I used to go out.|Oh, I didn’t, I didn’t know that.
Oh! Well then this is awkward. So what do you uh…|I think we’re here.
Oh! Yeah.|Yeah.
Okay.  Uh, huh. Excuse me, I’m sorry, I-I think you may be in our seats.|Umm, no, I don’t think so.
Yep! Yeah, see this says D-13, and uh…|Oh, well I thought that ah…

Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.|I-I wasn’t in that.

So that’s the girl you like.|Yeah.
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys this is, this is Kate’s understudy, Lauren.|Oh, hi!
So. How’d you guys meet?|Well ah, the short version is, I ah pursued her for a couple of months, then I gave her a check for 20,000 dollars, and she was mine.
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous!|Hey you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.
How do you do.  Did they have representation?|No, they-they weren’t in the play.
Ooh, what a shame! Because with her face  I could really put something together.|Could I borrow it?
Hi! Remember me?|Hi! Yeah! Tommy’s in line for the bathroom and someone just cut in front of him, I think he’s gonna snap.
Ross, I’m gonna go.|Go? Why?
I don’t know. Could be because I don’t feel like standing around all night waiting for some guy who may or may not scream.|But-but Cailin, he definitely will scream.
Good bye Ross.|Uh, oh-ho bye.
Hey!|Hey!
Yeah. Where were you?|Thank you for your patience, you’re the next caller.
You were the next caller five hours ago. You must be going crazy.|Nah. I kept myself busy.
Hey! Are you okay?|Fabulous.
Listen, drama critics they’re nothing but, but people who couldn’t make it as actors. You know what you should do?|Become a drama critic!
Oh, classy.|Yep! I sure know how to pick ‘em, huh? Y'know I gave up a part on a soap for this!
Wow! Yeah I ah, I gave up a job too.|Really. What?
Uh, de-clawing cats. Hey, tell ya what. Let me walk you home. We’ll stop by every news stand and burn every copy of their Times and the Post.|Why the Post?
Oh, you didn’t see the Post?|No. You?
So you really think those newspapers are just jealous of me?|Oh, absolutely! You’re talented and you’re good looking.
Oh, you’re sweet and cute.|I know! That’s why they trashed me!
What?|I, I don’t get you. I mean first, you hate me. Then you sleep with me. Then you want nothing to do with me, now you want me again.
What? So you never went out with an actress before?|Kate, do you even like me?
Of course I do.|Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?
I don’t know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy… Why can’t I just pick someone like you?|Thanks.
You know what I mean. I mean like the sweetest guy. Joey, you’re just so, you’re so, so…|I’m gonna put this can right here in case you have to hurl.
Please stay on the line. You’re call is very important to us.|Pheebs, you’ve been up for 24 hours! Go to sleep, honey. Th-this isn’t healthy.
This is from the woman at the bar.|Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Sorry. She thought you were somebody else.|What time is it?
You don’t want to believe me, I’m Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny…|Whoa!!
Whoa, sorry Tommy.|What’s in the cup, Ross?
Umm…|What is in the cup?!
Okay, it’s coffee.|Ice coffee? Tell me it’s ice coffee!
It’s-it’s hot…|Hot coffee!!! You idiot!! You were gonna spill hot coffee all over me, huh?!! What are you just some big, dumb, stupid, doofy idiot, with a doofy idiot hairdo, huh?! Huh?!
What’s your favourite thing about summertime?|Umm, going to the beach. When it stays light real late.
Yeah…|Hey!

Sorry! Sorry, I’m late; sorry, I’m late! My duck and my chick and a fight, it-it was ugly.|Look, we held the curtain for you buddy. Come on, let’s go! Let’s go!
Vic! Where have you been, baby?!|Where’s Kate?

Tonight. What are you doing?|I’m coming up!
Hey, mind if I use the phone?|Oh, I…
Yeah, but you didn’t.|No, but it’s-it’s-it’s hot!
Quack-quack, quack-quack!! What are you quacking about?! Dumb Donald Doo-Doo!!|Step away from the duck.
Joey!|Hey!
I’m soo glad I caught you, I couldn’t find you before.|Wh-wh-what’s going on? Wh-what’s this about L.A.?
They still want me for General Hospital.|But, but wh-what about us?
Last night was wonderful. But I-I can’t stay here just for you.|Well, so, stay for the museums!
I’m sorry.|Joey, onstage!
Flight’s in an hour. I-I gotta go.|Vic! Vic! Vic!!!
So this is it? Victor?|Yeah, I guess it is.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I’m gonna want to meet her.
Phoebe, it’s been two days.|Yeah, I know. Oh, good thing it’s one of those 801 numbers. Right?
What?|Well, I think I broke it. But that’s all right, here’s the number you can call.
Hey, wouldn't be cool if our duck and chick had a little baby? We could call it Chuck.|Or... Dick.
What was it?|Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.|Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
|Good deal.
Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.|Hi!
Vince is a fireman.|Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
Okay.|Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.|What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.|So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
Does a dog's lips move when he reads?  Okay, no they don't.|Hey guys!
Pete's breaking up with me.|What?!
I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.|And?
Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.|Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
Really?!|Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
...and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.|That is so great! Oh, I...  Oh my God!
Whoa!|Oh my God!!!
Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!|No! No!
No, no?|Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic.  Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
W-w-w-wait! Why?!|Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!|Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here.  What are you doing?
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.|Well that's not a third nipple.
No?|First of all, it's on your ass.
Well then, what is it?!|Wait a minute, hold it.  Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.|Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
Yeah. Which one do you like more?|Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
Y'know I have dinner plans!!|Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights!  Oh, see you just need to find the right command.|Yes, and the dimmer switch.
No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.|I-kea! This is comfortable.
I know.|No! But it's the nicest kitchen, the refrigerator told me to have a great day.
Joey, put that down!|Monica?
I guess that's how.|Hey Monica, how's it going.
Oh it’s umm, good! It's umm, it’s good, just here watering the plants.|Well don't forget that fiches over there by Rachel.
Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.|Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call.  Hey, how's it going?
Oh no-no-no, it's still me.|Ah, no it's not. I've got picture-in-picture here.  Monica? You. I'm gonna have to call you back.
Oh, oh, okay umm, so I'll see you soon.|Okay, I love you.
I love you.|I love you, love you.
Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.|So, what do you thing the good news is?
Oh my.|Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, “Look how much money we’ve got!” Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it’ll be dry, but people will like it.|Would you stop? We’ve only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don’t even know if he’s gonna propose.
Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!|All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?|Oh sure. Vince?!
Wow! I didn’t know you guys actually used those.|So, what’s up?
Umm, wow. This-this isn’t gonna be easy. Umm, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.|Uh-huh. G-good deal.
I’m sorry.|No-no it’s okay. It’s just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and…  That there’s so much in me I have to share with you yet.
Oh my God, I didn’t…|
I’m telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.|Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don’t want to make it savory.
Like for clubbing.|It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes.  I know it’s a little sudden, and it’s a little rushed, and it’s totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn’t mean I can’t. Right? I mean I’m-I’m crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?|You didn’t break up with that fireman?
No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he’s incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.|Wow!
Yeah, well he’d prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.|So then, are you going to dump Jason?
Jason?|Yeah, come on in.
You must be Ross.|Hi.
I am Guru Saj.|Listen, I got to tell you I’ve-I’ve never been to a guru before, so...
Well, relax. If it makes you feel better, I’ve attended some of the finest medical schools in Central America. Well then, let’s take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.  Eeh, huh. As I suspected, it’s a koondis!|What’s a koondis?
I don’t know, what’s a koondis with you?  Please, lie down! I’ve got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.|I guess it’s worth a try.
Oh sure, we should see results—Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!|What?! What?!
We appear to have angered it.|We?! We angered it?!
Oh, I think I see the problem. And I’m afraid we’re gonna have to use a much stronger tool.  Love.|Oh God!
Ross, there is absolutely no way this is going to come off unless you start to…|Ow!!
Oops.|What was, what was that?
Well it’s gone.|What?! How’s that?
It got caught on my watch.|Hey!
Lights.|Ooh, nice.
So ah, there was this thing I wanted to talk to you about.|Oh, right! I completely forgot about that.
Well ah, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I look at my life…|Yeah?
And I feel like I’ve conquered the business world, and I feel like I’ve conquered the intellectual world, and now I-I have the most beautiful woman in the world.|Wow.
There’s one thing missing.|What’s that?
It’s time for me to conquer the physical world.|Okay.
Monica, I want to become  the Ultimate Fighting Champion.|You wanna what?!
I want to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion! It’s the most intense physical competition in the world, it’s banned in 49 states!|What are you talking about?
Okay, my trainer, Ho Chi, is teaching me a combination of Gee Koon Doe and Brazilian street fighting, I’ve even had my own octagon training ring designed.|And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?|My parents will be so happy.
Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.|Hey. I was…
Hey!|I was passin’ by and I saw that you were playing tonight, it’s kinda cool seeing you up there.
I don’t know, he just started kissing me. Get him! Get him, Vince!|What?!
Yeah, okay, I’ve-I’ve been dating both of you, and it’s been really horrible. ‘Cause y'know it’s been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn’t know how to chose, so... I’m sorry, I’m just, I’m terrible, I’m a terrible person. I’m terrible.|Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it’s okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.
Really?!|Yeah. I mean y'know, we haven’t been going out that long. Come on, we haven’t even slept together yet. Huh.
Well, this is none of my business.|I-I can’t believe this! You-you’ve slept with him?!
Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.|Y'know Phoebe, I’m gonna make this real easy for you.
Well, that could’ve been really awkward.|You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I’m gonna do that for you.|Uh yeah, I can’t believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
Everything’s gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?|That’s supposed to be a duck right? ‘Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
Do you think that there’s a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you’re driving into town there’s-there’s like a sign, and it says “You’re in Sample.”|Hey.
I’m sorry. Ex-excuse us. I’m sorry, it’s a little crowded. Do you mind if we...|Yeah, could you scooch?
So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...|Why? Why?! What’s wrong with me?!
All right, so, so you went to Pete’s...|What happened?
Forget it.|So it’s-it’s not heeled yet?
So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?|I have no idea.
So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?|No-no-no oh, keep your name, don’t take his name.
Why?! What is it?|I don’t know exactly. It’s-it’s sorta like wrestling.
So thanks for the warm welcome. It’s good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let’s go out there and get ‘em! Huh? And remember, there is no ‘I’ in team.|Yes, but there’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
You! Chuckles! What’s your name?|Oh it’s Bing, sir. I’m sorry , I was just ah...
Yeah, we have the reservations.|Yes!!
Dude, what are you doing?|Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
All right so, Chandler, from now on, don’t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don’t turn your back to him.|Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?|I told you, we’re adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
It’s just hard when I know I have e-mail I can’t get!|Hi!
All right, on the table.|Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don’t want you to get hurt, ‘cause I kinda like you.
No! No boom-boom before big fight!|How ‘bout just a boom?
Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?|Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
This is Bonnie?  You’re Bonnie?|I can show you an ID if you want?
Oh no, I’m sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.|Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
Oh, that must be it.|Well I hope you have fun tonight.
You said she was bald.|Yeah, she was bald, she’s not now.
How could you not tell me that she has hair?|I don’t know, I hardly ever say that about people.
Ohh, well, this is just perfect!|Well I’m sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!|Well, maybe it won’t work out. Maybe Ross won’t like her personality.
Why, does she have a bad personality?|Oh no, Bonnie’s the best!
Bing!|What is with him?
Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?|No sir.
Hey!|God Ross, what is that?
Yeah, it’s the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!|From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He’s known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
I love you, Pete!!!|And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He’s a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
Pete! Pete!! That guy’s pretty huge!|Don’t worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent’s strength and weight against him.
Hey!  It’s me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.|It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant “You suck!”
I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.|What, look back?
Well, you’re not gonna get going are you?|Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
Well, no. But...|Well I’m not gonna stop until I’m the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!|Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad’s garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
You didn’t know that already?|Look, I’m gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
Okay, just get a lot better.  Fast.|Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
Hey.|Hey! How long until Pete’s fight?
Oh, about five minutes. Right now they’re interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.|Hot dog?
Four, please.|So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
Excuse me, Doug?  Hey there sports fan!!|Bing! You got those numbers for me?
No, I ah, I didn’t do them.|Oh, you forgot?
No, no I just ah, didn’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.|Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller.  Bing!
Doug!!|Hmm.
I’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.|Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
No, no. It-it’s not about the swearing, it’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.|Oh?
Oh, and don’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it’s making all the other guys jealous.|Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You’re okay.
Okay.|Ha!  Ahhhhhhh!
Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?|Oh my God! Phoebe look, it’s Ross and that girl.
No! No! Look at that!  It’s a line of ants! They’re working as a team!|Phoebe!
Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let’s go.|Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that’s, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that’s what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.|Ohh!  Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he’s gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
You said it was okay!|You said she was bald!!
What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!|Phoebe, we can’t, we just can’t just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don’t get it. Aren’t you the one that decided that you didn’t want to be with Ross?|Yes.
Well isn’t he your friend? Don’t you want him to be happy?|Yes.
So?|I just y'know, I didn’t expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
Oh no.|What?
Oh, we killed them all.|Oh!
It’s okay, it’s not as bad as it looks, it’s a precaution. Ah, I’m not supposed to move my spine.|Please tell me you’re stopping now.
I’m fine! I’d fight tonight, if they’d let me.  See this circle I’m marking off here? This is my zone of terror.|You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
I can’t until I’m the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I’m telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I’m not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.|Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam’s Apple, but that really hurt.|Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you’re gonna have to do it without me.
Well if you’re asking me to quit, then you’re asking me to be someone I’m not. I’ve got to do this.|Then I’ve gotta go. Bye.
Mon-Monica?|Yes?
So, in conclusion, the lines all go up|Thank you, sir.
Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard!  Well, what about you? You’re not feeling left out or anything are ya?|No. No, not at all, that’s-that’s ridiculous.
Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don’t you?|Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he’s just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...|Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.|Oh! Oh!
So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!|All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don’t know, we were, we were making out.
I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?|Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
That is so cool.|I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.|So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk.
Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.|You’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
Thanks!|Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I’ll be your boyfriend.
Yeah right.|Why is that so funny?
You made a joke right? So I laughed.|Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!|Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like  “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”
Well I’d probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.|Hey!
Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!|No, it’s just my luggage.
Seriously, where did you get the hat?|Ross gave it to me.
Go, go, go!|Oh yeah, now everybody wants to be under this hat!
Well, yes, it’s kind’ve an unusual house. It has umm, three beautiful bedrooms and ah, no baths. But y'know, the ocean is right there.|Knock, knock, knock.
|Are you ah, Phoebe Abott?
Ahh, yes.|Hi Phoebe Abott, I’m your best friends daughter!
You’re Erwin’s daughter?!|No, I-I mean your-your old best friend, here.  Lily, from high school. Remember?
Oh gosh, Lily, yes. Of course I remember Lily. I... Then you must be?|Phoebe. Phoebe, yeah. She named me after you I guess.
Uh-huh. Wow! Well, look! There’s Frank.|Yes!! Yes! Yes! Yes!! That’s my Dad, that’s Frank! Yeah! I’m sorry I’m getting all flingy.
Take it easy--if you want, there’s cookies on the counter, or, or--sangria!  I can make sangria!|No-no, sorry. Cookies are good, thanks.
Oh.|Well, so, umm, anyway umm, I’ve been, I’ve been looking for my Father, and umm, have you heard from him, or seen him?
Oh no, I-I’m sorry, I guess we lost track of everybody after high school.|Oh, okay. Well, so tell me everything about my parents. Everything.
Ohh, well. Y'know we were always together, in fact the had a nickname for the three of us.|Oh, what? What was it?
The three losers. Oh, poor Lily.  Ohh, y'know I-I heard about what happened, that must have been just terrible for you, losing your mother that way.|Yeah, no, it was great.
Hey, y'know what a really good rainy day game is?|What?!
I mean naked game. Strip poker, we should totally play strip poker.|No, no!
Come on! When you go away, you-you have to play, it’s like a law!|Allll done!
Hey, you know what naked card game is never boring?|Noo!!
What?|Really?!
Okay, all right.|Okay.
Fan out! Fan out!|Okay.
Strip Happy Days Game?|Yeah, well, I couldn’t find any cards, so it was either this or Strip Bag Of Old Knitting Stuff.
Okay, your band is playing at Arnold’s, collect three cool points. Which means, I have five, and that means I get Joey’s boxers!|Fine. Gang up on me! I got you all right where I want you.
|Whoa, hey! What are doing? Trying to get me drunk?
I’m just making margaritas.|Okay.
What?!|You painting his toenails?
Oh, come on!|Chasing him all around the room?
Monica, please?|He’s totally flirting with you too.
|Hey!
So, you still don’t think I’m boyfriend material?|Huh?
I saw you checking me out during the game last night.|You didn’t even take off your pants.
Yeah, well, lucky for you.|What?
I don’t know.|Well! Is everybody else having just the best time?!
Oh, yeah, I don’t know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house.|Good morning.
Hey, what happened to you?|Oh, ah nothin’. I just felt like hangin’ out here and reading.
Oh, the water was sooo great! We jumped off this pier and my suit came off.|Ohhhh, sorry I missed that.
Yeah, Joey and Chandler sure are funny.|Ohh-ha-ha!
I think I brought back half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I used to shave my head.|Y'know, I gotta tell ya, I just loved your look when you were bald.
Really?!|Ohh!
Because I think about shaving it all off again sometime.|Really?!
Yeah!|I mean you definitely should do that.
Y'know what, I should do it.|Yeah!
Yeah, thank you Rachel, you are soo cool.|Awww, stop. Come on. Now go shave that head!
What’s the matter, Pheebs?|She cancelled! My namesake cancelled on me!
What?!|Yeah, she clamed she had to go out of town suddenly. She’s avoiding me, she doesn’t want to tell me where my Father is. She knows, and she won’t tell me.
Hi.|Hi!
I was having a little chat with ah, Bonnie, and ah, guess what, she-she happened to bring up y'know, who was behind the um, whole head shaving idea, and now, who was it? Oh, that’s right, that’s right, it was you!|That was her idea, I just gave her a nudge.
She said you gave her the razor!|Hey guys.
Ahh, no, I’m good.|Okay, I’ll see you in a bit.
Okay, have fun! Wooo!!|Come on see, she doesn’t look that bad.
You can see the moonlight bouncing off her head! What the hell were you thinking?!!|I don’t know.
You don’t know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!|All right! Ross, do you think it’s easy for me to see you with somebody else?
Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?|Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
You still love me?|Noo.
You still love me.|Oh, y-yeah, so, you-you love me!
Noo, nnnnn. What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?|Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know. Ross, I still can’t forgive you for what you did, I can’t, I just, but sometimes when I’m with you I just, I feel so...
What?!|I just, I feel, I-I just...
What?|I feel...
No! No!! It’s me! It’s me! I-I didn’t want to make any noise!|Then don't break in!!
I’m sorry.|What are you doing here?!
I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.|What?!
Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you’re just mean!  So, just tell me the truth!|All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
My Father is Chuck Magioni?|No, no, that’s just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I’m very sorry, but I don’t know where your Father is, and that’s the truth.
Oh.|But umm, you’re right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah,  okay. I’m your mother.
Heh?|Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
I’m telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!|That’s not true! Her, she doesn’t even know what she wants! Rachel’s still mad about the whole thing.
So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you’re doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.|Yeah.
Hi there.|That’s that weird voice again.
Hi! I’m Dorf! You’re date for the evening.  Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that’s good stuff!!|Okay, so we went to the beach, because Phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad, and I don’t really know what happened with that.
I’m your mother.|Ehh?
Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn’t go out with a guy like Chandler...|
Hi!|Hi!
Awww.|Thanks a million.
Yeah.|Oh my God.
Okay, I gotta go.|Whoa! What?! Why?!
Well, I-I gotta go break up with Bonnie.|Here?! Now?!
Well, yeah. I can’t-I can’t stay here all night, and if I go in there she’s-she’s gonna wanna... do stuff.|Well, can’t you tell her that you are not in the mood?
No, she likes that. Yeah. Faking sleep doesn’t work either, I can’t tell you how many mornings I woke up with her...|Whoa-ho.
Whoa-oh, okay! Yeah, why am I telling you that?|I don’t know.
Yeah, yeah.  It wasn’t every morning.|Oh, making it worse!
So I guess you’d like to know how it all happened.|I-I mean I, well I think I can figure it out. I guess y'know I was born, and everyone started lying their asses off!
Noo! No! It wasn’t like that I... Remember how I told you how Lily, Frank, and I we were, we were close. Well, we were, we were very close.|How close?
Well, the-the three of us we were, kind of umm, a couple.|I don’t even know how that would work!
Well, we were...|I’m not asking!
Well, any how, some how I got pregnant, and, and I was scared. I was stupid and sellfish, and I was 18 years old. I mean, you remember what it’s like to be eighteen years old?|Yeah. Let’s see, my had Mom killed herself, and my Dad had run off, and I was living in a Gremlin with a guy named Cindy who talked to his hand.
Well, I’m so sorry. I thought I was leaving you with the best parents in the world, I didn’t even hear about your Mom and Dad til a couple of years ago, and by then you were already grown up. I don’t know, you’re here, and I would, I would really, I would like to get to know you.|Yeah, well, everybody does! I’m a really cool person. And y'know you had 29 years to find that out, but you didn’t even try! Y'know what, you walked out on me, and I’m just, I’m gonna do the same thing to you.
Wait!|I don’t ever want to see you again!
Shoot! We’re out of soda.|Oh, I’ll go out and get you some.
Really?!|Nope! Because I’m not your boyfriend.  Hey Pheebs, how did it go?
Sweety, what are you talking about?|Oh, my new Mom, who-who’s a big, fat abandoner!
It’s over.|Oh, was it awful?
Well, it was loong. I didn’t even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 o’clock shadow on her head.  Anyway, she didn’t want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.|I wrote you a letter.
Ohh! Thank you! I like mail.|It’s just some things I’ve been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.
Okay.  So, I’d better get cracking on this baby.|Well, I’ll be waiting for you, just come up when you’re done.
Oh.|What happened to you? Why didn’t you come up?
Done!|You just finished?
Well, I wanted to be thorough. I mean this-this is clearly very, very important to you, to us! And so I wanted to read every word carefully, twice!|So umm, does it?
I’m sorry.|Does it?
Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole ‘Does it?’ part just another glance.|What are you talking about, Ross, you just said that you read it twice! Look, y'know what, either it does or it doesn’t, and if you have to even think about it...
No, Rach, no. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t have to think about it, in fact, I’ve decided, I’ve decided that, that it.......does.|Are you sure?
Oh, sure! I’m sure.|I know.
All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?|Ennnh.
I’ve got canned goods.|Check this baby out, dug me a hole!
Excellent hole, Joe.|Oh no! No!! My hole!!
Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!|It’s like two miles!
We’ve got to do something!|Well, there’s really only one thing you can do.
Y'know what, he’s right. There’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain.|Well forget it! It doesn’t hurt that  baaad!!!!
Well, I’m ready to get the hell out of here!  But for you, yay! Ohh.|Hey!
Okay, I’m gonna put this  in the car.|Ooh, I have to go pack.  It really does?
She wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong in our relationship. I mean she goes on for five pages about, about how I was unfaithful to her!  WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!|Oh my God! If you say that one more time, I’m gonna break up with you!
Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  Does it?!!”|No?
Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you’re right. Yeah I guess I’ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.|Sure, it’s hard to forget! But that doesn’t mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.
What the hell happened on that beach?!|It’s between us and the sea, Ross!
Hi, Ursula.|Hey!
Okay, well umm, I know that we haven’t talked in a long time, but umm okay, our Mom is not our birth Mom. This-this other lady is our birth Mom.|Right, okay, the one that lives in Montuak, umm-hmm.
You know her?!|No, I umm, I read about her in Mom’s suicide note.
There-there was a suicide note?!  Well, do you still have it?|
I can’t believe you didn’t tell me there was a suicide note!|Yeah. So how have you been doing?
“Good-bye Phoebe and Ursula. I’ll miss you. P.S. Your Mom lives in Montauk.” You just wrote this!|Well, it’s pretty much the gist. Well, except for the poem. You read the poem, right?
Noooo!!|All right, hang on!
My God, you can’t even look at me! Can you?|Nope.
What? We took a walk, nothing happened. I can back with nothing all over me.|Come on!
No! Joey, we swore we’d never tell!|They’ll never understand!
I got stung. Stung bad. I couldn’t stand. I-I couldn’t walk.|
I was in too much pain.|And I was tired from digging the huge hole!
You can’t say that!! You-you don’t know!! I mean I thought I was gonna pass out from the pain! Anyway I-I tried, but I-I couldn’t...bend that way. So...|Ewwww!!
Except for you. You go away.|I’ll go in a second, I-I just wanted to tell you that there hasn’t been a day where I didn’t regret giving you up.
Okay, bye.|No, I’m not done. I-I-I just want you to know that I, the reason I didn’t look you up was, well I was afraid that you’d react, just well like, the way, the way you’re reacting right now, and can’t we just, y'know, start from here?
No.|Sorry. But just one last thing. Y'know you came looking for family. I’m family, I’m it. Now, now I’m done.
But, it’s not like we’re losing anything. Y'know?|Yeah, I guess you’re right.
It’s not like we-we know each other or anything. Or that have anything in common.|Well, I don’t know. I mean it’s not like we don’t have anything in common. I mean I like uh, pizza.
I-I like pizza!|You do?! Wait, I like umm, the Beetles.
Oh my God, so do I!|I knew it, wow!!
Wait-wait-wait, wait! Puppies. Cute or ugly?|Ohh, so cute.
Uh-huh, well! But umm, still I’m-I’m mad at you.|I know. I’m mad at me too.
Well umm, do you wanna get something to eat? I’m kinda hungry.|Hey! Me too!
Oh-hooo, I missed you.|I missed you too.
Ooh, I was soo nervous about that letter. But the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?|I suppose.
You have! Ross, you should give yourself credit. I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”|Umm-hmm.
WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!|Coffee house?
And for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship!!|Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!|What?!!
I fell asleep!|You fell asleep?!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!!  Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’|Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
|Oh, oh, and hey-hey-hey, those little spelling tips will come in handy when you’re at home on Saturday nights playing Scrabble with Monica!!
Oh, no-no-no don’t you worry about me falling asleep. I still have your letter!!!|And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
Gin.|We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.
Will you stop!|Okay. All right.
Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!|How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
You don’t turn and slide, you throw it out! I’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!|Look, we’re not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
All right, how about we, how ‘bout we sell it.|All right. But, you’re gonna have to tell them.
Hey Monica, it’s Chip.|Yesss!!
Good runnin’ into you at the bank today, so ah, here’s my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.|Chip, is Chip Matthews.
Thank you, thanks.|Hey, here’s a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?|Why? I love that thing.
Yeah, I actually don’t know...|Good, so do I
Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you!  Oh my God.|What?
Nothing. Nothing.|What? What’s wrong?
I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.|You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.|Are you sure she’s in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma’s glycoma medicine again?
No Dr. Skeptismo! I’m sure. First of all, okay, there’s the feeling.  Oh, I haven’t seen this smile in 17 years!|Dude, Phoebe’s mom has got a huge peni...
Hey!|Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you’re going out with Chip Matthews?
Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?|Nooo! It’s not okay! I can’t believe you would want to after what he did to me!
What, that little thing at the prom?|Monica! I couldn’t find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?|I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
Look, you and I went to different high schools...|Okay, that doesn’t help me, because we went to the same high school.
You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip’s motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.|They had to have that specially made?!
It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.|Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he’s-he’s called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.|Oh, you go out with him.
Oh, really?!|Yeah. Just, if it’s possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?|Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don’t think any of them are gonna work out.
So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?|Well, I’m not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there’s y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she’s worried that y'know, she’s gonna, she’s gonna be replaced.  Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe’s mom remind anyone of a cat?|Ross, don’t start.
Come on, you-you can’t tell me you actually believe that-that there’s a woman inside that cat!|I believe it.
No you don’t.|Yes, I do.
No you do—y'know what, you’re not gonna suck me into this.|Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
I do not always have to be—okay, okay.|Jurassic Park could happen.
Wow! That’s ah, that’s pretty nice!|Pretty nice?
We don’t have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We’ve got a canoe.|Y'know, I, I really don’t think we need a canoe.
You gotta take the canoe!|All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
Look kinda familiar?|Apparently Phoebe’s mother also goes by the name Julio.
You guys, there’s a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!|Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
Do we have to tell her?|Yes, we have to tell her!
I hate when Ross is right!|He is right, isn’t he?
|Hi!
Yeah?|How’s that going?
So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.|That’s so sweet.
I just feel so, uhh.....|All right!!
|Hello, Chip.
This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.|What?!
Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn’t, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny ‘til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.|No, you, you can’t fit in that thing. That’s not deep enough.
Oh yeah?  If I can’t, I’ll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.|All right, you have yourself a deal.
Here, we are.|Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
The what?|That’s what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you’re Chip. Nevermind.
No, I think it’s cute.|Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
So you still in touch with anyone from high school?|Umm. Well, there’s Rachel, and umm, I think that’s it. How bout you?
Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.|Is that all?
Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.|Ohh, how is he?
Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.|Isn’t he an architect now?
OH MY GOD!!!|WHAT?!!
Are you all right?!|Yeah...
What happened?!!|Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!|Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!
So—You got in voluntarily?!|I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?
...and then Zana, just let one rip!!|Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, ‘cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don’t even know where you work?
You know where I work!|I do?
The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.|You still work at the multiplex?
Oh, like I’d give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.|Thanks, I’m set. Do you still live with your parents?
Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.|Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
So, how was your date?|Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
Um-hmm.|Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
Oh honey, I’m sorry.|No, it’s okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
Ohh! That’s so great!|I know!
I’m sorry, sweetie.|Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
You could.... say you’re sorry to her mom.|I think she would like that.
So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?|Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you’re welcome to come back anytime.
I’ll go with you.|Me too.
Hey!! We are so in luck! Treeger said that we could have all this cool stuff from the basement. Wait right there.|Oh no-no-no, I’m, I’m paddling away!
Huh?!|Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped!|Could we be more white trash?
How desperate am I?|Oh! Good thing Chandler’s not here, he always wins at this game.
I just told my Mom I’d cater a party for her.|How come?
Because I need the money, and I thought that it’d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.|Come on, I think this is a good thing. I don’t think Mom would’ve hired you if she didn’t think you were good at what you do.
Hey! Umm, do you guys have any juice?|Just pickle.
My boss, Joanna? Wow, that must’ve been awkward.|Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink.
You ah, you didn’t say ‘Yes’ to that did you?|No. No!
I don’t understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a ‘big, dull dud.’|Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.
Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!|Oh, come on! It’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually I’m pretty much just in there by myself.
Chandler!!  Promise me, you will end it.|Okay, I promise, I’ll end it.
Thank you.|I hope you know what I’m giving up for ya, because she’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.
How’s the hired help?|Doing great, the quiches are coming along.
What’s this? Blue nail polish?|Yeah, I thought it was cute.
Ahh, that’s what your Grandmother’s hands looked like when we found her.|Let me ask you a question.
Hmm.|Why did you hire me?
Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you weren’t sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something.|Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks I’m good.
Good afternoon, are you the decision maker of the house?|Uhhhh.
Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias?|No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.
…I’m telling you it’s totally unconstituional.|Oh yeah, I totally agree.
…I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.|Nooo!!
Excuse me, I’m sorry, you haven’t said anything for about two and a half minutes, are you at all interested?|Yeah-well-yeah! Yeah-oh-yeah. Come on in.
That’s weird.|What?
Your nails.|Oh, I know, I never wear fake ones. I just did it so my Mom wouldn’t give me grief about me biting them.
Oh, no, I meant that it’s weird that you only have nine now.|Oh my God! It’s in the quiche! Oh My God!
Okay, don’t panic. I’m gonna go to the store, I’m gonna get you another set of nails, no one’s gonna know, and you’re gonna look great.  Oh! Oh, it’s ‘cause they’re gonna eat—that’s the problem.|Honey, don’t bite your nails.
And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!|I’m not freaking out.
I don’t get it.|No, I have faith…
It just doesn’t…feel like we’re breaking up.|No, we are. I’m sad.
Okay.|Unbelievable!!
Thanks.|No, no, that was my boss. I have to go.
Okay.|What are you doing?
I’m getting dressed.|Why?
When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.|Wait. I wanna show you something.
What is it?|Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.  Put your hands together.
Ah-ha, you’re not the boss of me.  Ooh, saucy.|
You are, you’re gonna leave me like this?|Knowing you’re here, waiting for me I think it’s kinda exciting.
Oh.|Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!
Oh great! I’ll keep it in my butt with your nose.|That’s weird, she locked the door.
Hello, Joanna……’s office.|I’m really sorry but I may be a little while longer.
How little?!|A couple of hours, I feel awful.
Look, this isn’t funny! You get back here right now!|I can’t!!
Why not?!|I’m in my boss’s car!
What?!|Uh-oh, tunnel.
You promised you would break up with her!|I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!
And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!|It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.
Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.|No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I can’t get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and I’m cold, and
Oh, Chandler!! All right, this is it!  You never see Joanna again!|Never!
You never come into this office again!|Fine!
You give me back my Walkman!|I—never borrowed your Walkman.
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one!|You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great!
Does it hurt?|No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them.  Hello sweet pants!
Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?|About what?
When she sees that you’re gone, she’s gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and I’m gonna get fired!|I’ll make something up! I’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!
No, there’s nothing to make up, she’s gonna know that I have a key to her office, I’ve got to get you locked up back the way you were!|Oh-ho-ho, I don’t think so!
So, here’s somebody interesting, Joey. What do you know about Van Gogh?|He cut off his ear.
And?|I’m out.
He painted that.|Wow! That’s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear ‘cause he sucked. What else you got in there?
Let’s see, ahhh… Where does the Pope live?|In the woods. No wait-wait, that’s the joke answer.
Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?|Spock’s birth control.
Hey!|Hi.
This used to be your room?  Wow! You must’ve been in really good shape as a kid.|Ohh, I’m such an idiot. I can’t believe I actually thought she could change.
Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.|Oh good, I’m glad that’s catching on.
No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and we’ll call that pulling a Monica.|What?
Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A’s, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that one’s outta here." Though some things don’t change.|All right, I’ll go down there. But, I’m not gonna serve the lasagna. I’m gonna serve something I make.
Chandler! Chandler, please, I have to get you locked up back the way you were, I am sooo gonna lose my job, she’s very private about her office. Now I know why.|Hey, look, you’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, she’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.
What if I clean your bathroom for a month?|It still wouldn’t be clean.  All I want is my freedom.
Foot rubs for a month!|Freedom!
I’ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums!|Freedom! I want my freedom! Why won’t you here me?!
No! God, would you just calm down!|I’m gonna say this for the last time. Would you please just…
Wow! There’s a lot I didn’t know about vomit.|So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!
Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? I’m home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess there’s a few things you don’t get from book learnin’.|Well ah, what can you swing?
How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?|You don’t have, anything?
You wanna see what I got?  Okay? I’ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!|Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time.
And a 50.  Huh, these must be Chandler’s pants.|For 50 bucks, you can get one book! What will it be? A? B? C?
I ah, will buy and wrap all of your Christmas gifts.|No!
I ah… Oh! I’ll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning!|With extra pulp?
Yeah!!|No!
D’oh!!  I’ve got it!|You don’t have it.
I have so got it. There’s gonna be rumours about this, there’s no way to stop it. Sophie knows, Monica and Phoebe know.|How do Monica and Phoebe know?
Oh, I called them. And when they ask me what I saw, I can be very generous  stingy.|Go on.
I can make you a legend. I can make you this generation’s Milton Berle.|And Milton Berle has a…
Well?|They’re not even touching the lasagna!
Really?!|Oh, they love your casserole.
Yes!!|It’s hard to believe that just a little while ago this was nothing but ingredients.
And you?|I thought it was… quite tasty.
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it, that would make this a success. Which would make you…|A bitch?
Well, I was going for wrong, but we can use your word.|Yes, well I was wrong, and I have to say you really impressed me today.
Wow!|Umm, you might even say that she pulled a Monica.
Hello.|Hey!
|Wh-what’s going on?
Two hours, that lasted!|So did you break up with Joanna?
I think so.|Well, it’s good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like that Vesuvius.
Who’s out there?|It’s me! Good morning!
Rachel, could you come in here for a moment, please?|Yeah, sure. Umm, they didn’t have poppy seed bagels, so I…  Oh my word!
I seem to have had a slight office mishap. Could you please get the key off the back of the door for me.|Oh, yeah! Yeah!
You tell your friend Chandler that we’re definately broken up this time.|Okay.
Hey! New wallet, huh?|Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesn’t say ‘cool’ anymore.
Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.|: Hey.
Ummm. Oh! I’m sorry.  It’s a little old but…|: No! You’re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour unclogging!
I’m sorry. I didn’t—I don’t come in here a lot.|: Oh yeah, of course you don’t!
No.|: ‘Cause you’re a little princess! "Daddy, buy me a pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of Cats sing Happy Birthday to me…"
I didn’t… I never said that.|: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don’t think of someone else for a change?
Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?|Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true.
I’m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.|Joey, please don’t do that. I think it’s best that we just forget about it.
All right that’s it, school is in session!|My God! Is this a gym card?
: Tribbiani! Hold on, I’ll get the plunger.|Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now, you’re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the landlord.
: And tell him what?|Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.
: Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!|I have actually not heard of that.
: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I’ve been a nice guy up until now, but uh, I don’t need this grief. I’m gonna call the landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother’s apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.|Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know!
Oh please, somebody tell me I don’t have to go to work today!|What’s the matter?
Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every time I see him I just want to do things to him that I’m not allowed to charge for.|So do them for free.
Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling around with clients. And it’s against my oath as a masseuse.|They make you take an oath?
No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one’s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just makes good sense.|Why don’t you just give him to somebody else?
No, I can handle it. No, I’m a professional.|Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?
I don’t what your talking about.|Then how do you explain the toe ring?!
Oh! My hero! What happened?|Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he’d better come up here and apologize. I’ll see you later.
What?! You got us evicted!!|I told you not to go down there!
That’s not true!|Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like you’ve never sucked before!
Go!!|All right, all right, all right.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey! Now remember what we talked about, you gotta be strong.|Yes.  Yes!
One more time, "Hey, don’t you want a washboard stomach and rock hard pecs?"|No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
Good! That’s good!|Okay.  I wanna quit the gym.
Me? No.|Sorry, members only.
It’s okay man, be strong.|So, are you a member of any gym.
No! And I’m not gonna be, so you can save you little speech.|Okay, no problem.  Could you come here for a second?
Wow, you have really pretty feet.|These old things.
Would you mind spending some time on my siadic area, it’s been killing me today.|You mean the—Okay by siadic, you mean the towel covered portion.
Yeah.|Sure, yeah, no I can do that, yeah, because umm, y'know, the muscles in the siadic area can get y’know, real  nice and tight. So umm, tell me Rick, how umm, how did you injure the area.
Oh, a 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.|Oh.
Ow! Did you just bite me?|No!
: What?|Please don’t kick Monica and Rachel out, this wasn’t there fault, it was mine.
: You want me to kick you guys out instead?|No you can’t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?
: You have pets!|Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I’m the chick and Chandler is the duck.
: Huh, I would’ve thought it was the other way around.|Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I’ll do whatever you want.
: Really? You’ll do anything?|Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
: Yeah, I’ve got something you can do.|What, what is it?
: Can you be my dancing partner?|That’s not, prison lingo, is it?
His dancing partner?!|Yeah, there’s this superintendent’s dance, the Super Ball. I don’t know, and he wants to impress Marge, this lady super that he’s a crush on.
Oh, would you let it go already?! You’re fine!|Hey.
Wait, now so you joined the gym?|And that’s funny, why?
Well, you could actually go to the gym.|Or! Or, we could go to the bank, close our accounts and cut them off at the source.
Well, next time your massaging him, you should try and distract yourself.|Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Like-like when I’m doing something exciting and I don’t wanna get too excited, I just ahh, y’know try to thing of other things like ah sandwiches, and ah baseball, and ah Chandler!
All right, I’m here, let’s ahh, get this over with.|: Okay ahh, well, just ahh, follow my lead.
Whoa-whoa, don’t we need to do some kinda preparation first? Like ahh, get really drunk?|: Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.
No, it’s okay, but if I’m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.|: Ahh, forget it! I’ll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I’m just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.
Come on man, you’re not a potato.|: I’m sure as hell a dancer, it’s no use Marge will never go for me.
Come on Treeger, don’t say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let’s ahh, let’s try it again. Come on.  We-he!! Hey!|: Yeah!
Hey-hey, how goes the dancing? Gay yet?|Ah-ha-ha, you guys owe me big time.
Yes you did! You did like a little hop.|You are soo enjoying this.
You know the words! You are so into this!|All right, well maybe I’m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I’m getting pretty good at it.
All right, then show me some manly moves.|All right.
Hello.|Hi.
We’d like to close our accounts.|Close your accounts? Is there some kind of problem?
No-no.|No, we’d just like to close them.
Okay, you’re all set.|Oh wow! That was amazing, was that really just an hour?!
Yeah! In… really long hour world.|What?
Ugh, okay, I have an enormous crush on you. But because you’re a client, I can’t ask you out, even though you give me y’know, the feeling.|Wow! I had no idea! But you know, I could always find another masseuse.
Really?!|Yeah, really.
What?|Suddenly, I very aware that I’m naked.
|Mr. Simon’s been waiting for— Oh my God!
Oh yeah, oh and I know, but this isn’t what it looks like, ‘cause Rick is my ahh, husband.|Oh really? Well, then you’d better tell his other wife, ‘cause she called three times asking where he is.
So you didn’t leave the bank?|No! And somehow, we ended up with a joint checking account.
Oh my Gosh!|It’s so weird, I have never been fired from anything before!
We did it!!|: I know, we did it!! Hey, that was incredible, huh?!
I know, it was amazing! I mean, we totally nailed it, it was beautiful.|: Thank you, listen, thanks a lot Tribbiani, . Oh my God, look at the time, I gotta catch the bus to the ball.
Oh well, okay, good luck.|: Yeah.
Unless you wanna practice the Foxtrot again? Or-or the Tango?|: Ahh, thanks but no. You see I-I think I’m ready to dance with girls.
Okay.|: Yeah.
Go get ‘em Treeger.|: Right.  Hey, ahh, you wanna come? Marge has a girlfriend.
Really?|: Yeah, you could dance real good with her, she’s the same size as me.
So it looks like you’ve got some great experience here. Let’s see ahh, reason for leaving last job?|Yeah, they thought I was a whore.
Okay, we’ll give a call if anything comes up.|Great! Thank you very much.
|Thank you.
Rachel?|Yeah?
When's your birthday?|May fifth, why?
Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.|Oh, mine's December...
Yeah, whatever.|Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
Hi!|Hi.
Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.|I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
Oh my God! That's why I got up too!|You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...|Oh please!
So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.|Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.|Oh-oh-oh-oh!
Is it on?|No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
Hey!|Oh my God!
There we go little fella.|What about the duck?
Well the duck can swim.|Oh, jeez.
My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.|Way to go, Phoebe!
It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.|Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.|Y'know what, I like Kathy.
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.|Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.|Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.|Hey!
Hey.|So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
Hi.|Dudes.
Wow, cute one!|Very!
Hi!|Hi!
Hi Ben!|Wow! You-you look great!
Thanks!|Hey Tommy.
I am so glad that you could come over tonight.|Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.|What?
I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.|I-I-I...
|Who wants to make some long distance calls?
Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy!  Kathy.|Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"|Hey!
Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.|Her date tipped me ten dollars.
Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.|Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.|You mean you stole it!  Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
99...100! Ready or not, here I come!  All right, let's go over the concept one more time.|Hey!
Hey!|Hey guys.  Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.|It's 4:30.
Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.|Okay, I see what's going on here.
You-you do?|Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
You got me.|Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
Yeah. Right.|Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
Ross isn't here.|Oh.  Stop it!
What?|I think he's stealing from me.
Why?|Because he's stealing from me!
Thank you so much Phoebe.|Sure.
What are you doing with those?!|But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
Sorry, Phoebe.|It's okay. How's the soup?
Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!|Is she great or what?
So? Huh? What do you think?|Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
Not your type?! She's gorgeous!|Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!|Uhh, no-no thanks.
Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.|Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?|No, sorry.
At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.|Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
You see Amanda and I have a very special...|You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
Fine.|Sorry.
Here.  At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.|Y'know...
Does it even work without my sexy voice?|I like it.
Gunther, kiss me.|What?
And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.|Rachel?
So, thank you for the delicious dinner.|You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
Hey what are you guys looking at?|Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
I know!|Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.|Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.|Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?|Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.|Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
Well, I have a call in about that.|'Kay.
Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.|Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.|Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.|Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
It doesn't say that. Does it?|How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.|It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
Hey!|Hey.
You can pee here!|Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?|Yeah!
Oh, I know...|And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?|No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
Hey!|Hey, how'd it go?
Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow—the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!|Mon! I'm so happy for you!
Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff.  Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!|I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look—I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.|Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
Huh...|Um, would you like to come in?
Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?|According to recent findings!
Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!|Mitzi is.....
My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.|...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
What?|Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
I'd rather not.|Oh, yeah, why not?
Oh, is everything in the car?|Yes. Did you settle the bill?
No. I hate this part.|Oh, look what we almost left.
No, that's not mine.|Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.|Oh, good. Thank you.
Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...|Dear?
Just the matter of ...payment?|
You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.|Sure...
And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?|I don't know... um, Grease?
No....|Rent?
Yes! Rent!|Okay, so when do you want to go?
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.|Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
What did you get her?|A pen.
Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?|Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
But Mon, you have to get our money!|Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?|What?
Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"|Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.|Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....|She seems fine now.
So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?|You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
Yeah.|Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived!  Here.
Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?|What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.|No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
What kind of smell?|I don't know. Soap?
All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?|Yeah.
You wanna see her again, right?|Yeah.
So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!|Yeah, okay you're right.
Yeah.|I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
Yeah!|It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.|Any luck?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy."  Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?|All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.|Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?|Oh! Pathetic!
Where?|Our place, the hall! I...
I got something for her.  It's a book!|Is it like a book that's also a safe?
No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?|You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one.  Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
No, it came out to an even twenty.|Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
You didn't get the money, did you?|Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough!  Hey, widow?|Come on along and listen to...
Okay, Widow!|...the lullabye of...
Excuse me. Excuse me!  Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.|All right. I'll get my bag.
Good.|I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
So you want to come inside?|
Guess who?|Department of Sanitation?
It's me!|Oh!
What?|Ah, Cheryl!
Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!|Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
Uh... yay!|Thanks!
Yeah. I'm a hard ass.|And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!|Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
Okay!|I can cook and you can take care of the money.
Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!|Aah!
Hey!|Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.|Oh yeah? That's great!
Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!|[nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....
Hey.|Hey!
Thank you!|You know, uh... [Joey moves the pen case out onto the counter.] Chandler got you a gift, too.
You really didn't have to.  Wow.|See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. .|Oh, yeah... yeah.
I'll be in in a minute.|Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. .
Um, thank you for the gift.|Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.|Uh, the book?
The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.|What do you mean?
Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.|Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.|Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
Well....|Goodnight.
Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.|Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!|Y'know if we ever go to war and you’re captured, you’re in for a big surprise.
It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it’s bad enough that I’m in love with my roommates girlfriend—which by the way, I think she knows. Because every time we’re in the room together there’s this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when I’ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she’s smooth! Smooth!|Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?
Here you go.|Great! All right, so I’ll call you later.
Great!|Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?
"Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of ease…" Darn it! Now, I don’t know who to get to the next verse.|Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of ease…  BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.
Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about ‘bah-bah-bha-bhan?’|Well umm, y’know, I used to play.
Oh yeah, that’s right, the keyboards, huh?|Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean that’s-that’s when I really found my sound.
I wanna hear "The Sound."|Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven’t played in so long, and-and, well it’s-it’s really personal stuff, y’know?
Come on, play that funky music white boy.|Yeah!
Okay, guys.|All right! Bring it on, you…
Here we go.  Y’know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That’s what I’m…|Oh my God! Play!
Really?! I mean, really?!!|Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!
Wow! Thanks, you guys. That’s uh—ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I’ll be right back! Okay?|Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!
Come in!|Oh God, is that Baywatch?
Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.|So is Joey around?
No-no, he’s not back yet, but he’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?|I uh, don’t really have a preference. You?
I like it in the stern.  Hello.|Hey, it’s me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.
What happened?|We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I’ll be there as soon as I can.
Why can’t you tell her?|‘Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about to—
Joey! Joey!!|Yeah?
I thought your time ran out.|Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more—
Uhh, that was Joey. He’s running a little late, he says he’s sorry.|Oh.
So I guess it’s just uh, you and me then.|Oh, okay.
Yeah, I think it is!|So what did you do today?
Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut…|Oh, it looks great!
…and then it got canceled.|Well, I could cut it.
Really?! You do that?|Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt’s dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?
You have really great hair.|Well, thanks. I grow it myself.  Y’know who also has great hair is Joey!
Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I’m basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.|What-what ‘cha doin’?
Checking to see if it’s even.|‘Kay.
Looks good.|Hello!
I should uh, probably go.|Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
I forgot my purse.|Oh.
No-no-no-no, this is bad! It’s bad! This is bad!|Horrible!
Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?|No-no-no, the kiss was good.
Okay!|No, but that’s bad!
Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here’s what we do, we-we forget it happened.|What?!
Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we’re unhappy forever. Sound good?|Can you really do that?
I have to; he’s my best friend, and you’re seeing him.|Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you…
Oh-no-no-no! Don’t! Don’t! See-see, you’re getting me confused, I’m starting to urn.|I’m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.
I-I think we have too.|Okay. Bye.
Bye.  Are you still out there?|
Emphatic time-time-time…|Y'know, there’s a Starbucks about three blocks down.
Thank you guys-guys-guys…|Hey, aren’t you up next?
Aww man! I can’t believe I locked myself out again!|Hang on buddy!
Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?|I sure did.
Why?|Well, I just thought it’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.
Well, you’re amazing.|Oh no-no-no. This is amazing.
A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That’s the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?|Well, y’know I’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.
Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.|Oh, I don’t know.
Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I’m gonna do that.|You mean with Casey.
No-no-no, I think I’m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She’s pretty cool.|Or Casey.
No-no, Kathy.|Could be Casey.
No. No, Kathy.|Consider Casey.
Y’know what I think? I think somebody’s got a little crush on Casey. How ‘bout I fix you two up? What do you think?|That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
Hey!|Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!
Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don’t want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?|Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.
Pheebs…|Yeah, I-I can’t—I mean y’know I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just—I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. I…
See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Y’know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I… I won’t play anymore.|Oh no. No-no-no, don’t do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.
Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.|Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!
What?|Are you serious?
No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would’ve just stepped aside.|Oh, don’t say that! Don’t say that. That’s not true. Is it?
Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.|Yeah! No, that’s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.
Hey!|Hey! Samboucha Margarita?
Is that a real thing?|Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.
Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.|What’s up?
It’s-it’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.|You do?
Yeah.|Well, you’re timing couldn’t be better. She’s not my girlfriend anymore.
What?|Yeah, she broke up with me.
Oh uh, when?|Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that’s why I let people watch.
Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?|Well, I’ve been better. But, I’m all right. So you like her huh?
Yes, but I-I uh, don’t have too.|No-no-no, no it’s uh, it’s okay.
Yeah?|Yeah. You know why? ‘Cause you came to me first.
Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.|But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you’re work cut out for you. ‘Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she’s into some other guy. So…
See uh, that’s-that’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.|Who?
It’s me. I’m the other guy.|What?
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…|And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.|What?!! That’s even worse!!
How is that worse?!|I don’t know! But it’s the same!
Look, I’m sorry! But there’s nothing I can do, I think I’m in love with her!|Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!
You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.|Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!|Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, y’know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there’s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I’m not gonna eat! You know why?!
Probably because…|Because it’s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And I’m not happy about you either.
Oh my God, he’s lost it. He’s totally lost it.|What?
After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.|Yeah, like I could lose it.
Hello.|
Stop callin’!!|Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
All right!|What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything…
Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!|Look everyone, it’s the spirit of Thanksgiving!
They couldn’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.|Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
Well, I’m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.|We haven’t eaten yet!
I know, but all that work you’re doing to get it ready, I just…|Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, ‘cause I wanna trade for her.
People are trying to sleep in here!|Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.|No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can’t go to him when I don’t have a boyfriend!
This is so cool, ‘til Monica gets back, it’s like I’m head chef and I get to make all the decisions.|Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
Okay, get out of my kitchen!|I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
All right I… I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.|So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I’m already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
Hey!|Hey!
What are you doing?|I’m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
Everything? Even the TV?|No! I’m putting that in my room.
Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don’t you think you could at least hear the guy out?|Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
That’s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?|Five years.
You’ve sentenced him?!|Hey! Don’t do the crime if you can’t do the time.
Joey, the guy’s your best friend.|No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don’t know why you’re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there’s a spot open.
Oh, who? Me?|Yeah!
Wow! I’m honored! And y’know what I’m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?|What?
I’m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.|All right. But if you weren’t my best friend.
Oh my God, is it really that bad?|I walk into a room and he won’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
Oh.|Hey Joe.
I’ll be right with you. Okay?  Thanks, Wendy.|Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
Hey! I’m sorry! That— where are you going?|My folks.
Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?|I don’t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
What?!|Yeah, y’know at first I thought we could talk about this y’know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don’t think I…
Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I’ll stop seeing her?|Look, it’s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don’t want to live with some one who doesn’t know what it is to be a friend. So, I’ll see ya.
Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!|Yeah! You did! And that’s why I’m leaving.
All right look, if you’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!|When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
What?|Yeah! But if would’ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn’t have worried about it so much! See you around!
All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down.  What?|We’ve got a box.
Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.|I was probably waiting for it to open.
I gotta tell you, you look great now.|You look great too.
You’re an excellent patient!|So how does it look?
Well, you’ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.|Like a pirate?!
If that helps you.|Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad?  Come on, one of us had to mention him.
I moved back here a couple of months ago.|Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
Uh.|No way!
I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend’s.|Oh.
But we broke up.|Oh.
She-she wasn’t ready for a serious commitment.|So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
You’re not wearing the patch yet.|I know.
He’s coming here for Thanksgiving!|I know, it’s sick.
Yeah.|What’s twisted?
Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard’s son, you’d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.|Fine! Judge all you want to but,
Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?|Why?
I just wanna check something.|Okay.
Now, we’ll see.|Air hole! Air hole!!
The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.|Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!|Well isn’t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
What did you get?|Credit.
Hey.|And Rachel.  And that’s Chandler.
What happened? What happened?!|You kissed my girlfriend!
Gotcha!|That doesn’t sound like thinking to me!
Sorry!|Y’know I don’t think you should be talking at all in there! I think you’ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
Okay, okay, you got it!|Ross, can you pass me the yams?
You can’t tell, but I’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!|All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn’t mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you’re just an idiot in a box!
You’re right, and I’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won’t say another word tonight.|So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
Absolutely!|That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?  Okay.
|Here, let me help.
Thank you.|You-you have a very beautiful… eye.
Y’know all my friends think this is weird.|Y’know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn’t.
I know! I mean it’s like me and your dad, that’s a totally separate thing.|Oh, I totally agree.
We’re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?|What?
Nothing. Nothing.|No-no really, was-was that not okay?
No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss…|Oh my God! It didn’t remind you of…
Don’t say it!|No, but it did! Didn’t it?!
Yeah!|Oh man!!
I’ll get it.|Oh.
Hey.|Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am…
That’s okay. Chandler’s the one I’m mad at.|Well, I’m still sorry. Is he here?
In the box.|Chandler?
|What?!
He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there!  Get out of there!|So?
Yeah, we’re gonna be fine! Get out!|Yeah?
Yeah, you did some real good thinkin’ in there.|Man, this is…
Oh, he sees her!|Oh, he’s catching up to her!
Okay!|Come on, no peeking!
Okayyyyy, open up!|What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
Yeah, it’s for our catering business!|I think I know that girl.
No, we’re gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.|Oh!
And also, we don’t know what to do with this.|Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?|Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence… dozens of people.|How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
Oh no-no-no, it’s only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.|Yay!!
Oh.|Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?|Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There’s an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss…|Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and…|Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can’t stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
God, I am so glad you don’t have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn’t even consider applying.|Really? Well, in that case…
And that’s I’m so glad… there’s no problem.|That’s fine, actually I’m on the hiring committee, so there’ll be at least one friendly face.
Ohh! That’s great!|You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
Really?!|No-ho-ho!  I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don’t you worry, I’m sure with your qualifications you won’t need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
Well, I, umm…|Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
Oh man! I am so excited—I may vomit!|Will you calm down, he’s just a human guy.
Look you don’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y’know you’re never know what’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!|Really?!
Oh yeah, it’s beautiful country up there.|Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
It’s not gonna be exactly like last time.|All right, I’ll see you guys.
Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!|I have an audition, but I’ll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
|What happened?
He’s not gonna make it, he’s stuck in Chicago.|Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.|Thank you.
Yes, that’s very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.|Yes, I realize that…
Hey! My first review is out!|Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
All right, look at my on the back page.|Oh, okay!  Wow! You really laid into this place.
Hey, they don’t pay me a penny a word to make friends.|Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
Oh! Do you need me to go with you?|No-no, it’s okay. But are we sure we don’t want the waterbed?
Haven’t we made this decision?|Yeah, all right.
Bye!|Bye!
Who is it?|It’s Allesandro, from Allesandro’s.
Oh my God.|I want to talk to you about your review.
Oh my God, oh my God.  Call me on the phone!|Why? So you could hang up on me?
Look, I-I’m never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.|Just give me a chance too…
No! Phoebe!|Hey, Monica!
I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!|I couldn’t eat it! I had five friends who couldn’t eat it, and one of them eats books.
Well our service is not grossly incompetent.|The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!|All right, that I’ll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn’t it. You’re marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
Hey! I’m proud of that sauce, it’s delicious.|Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
Lebanon.|Hand me those tomatoes, I’m gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.|I thought it went very well.
No! It didn’t! That’s what I want to talk to you about.  I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.|Rachel, please, don’t make a scene.
There’s nobody here!|Sophie, get in here!  You see! Now you’re making Sophie uncomfortable!
Do you want me to quit?|What?! What would make you think that?
Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y’know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk,|Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it’s drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn’t want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
What?|That’s why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking…
My drinking?|Oh, I must’ve said that after you left.
Said what? Exactly.|That you enjoyed the occasional drink…ing binge.
Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I’m leaving! You are just a horrible person!|Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you’re gonna get all sensitive about it! I don’t want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I’ll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
Say more things like that.|You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
I’d need an expense account.|Done!
And an assistant.|Sophie, get in here!
Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you’d be out partying with Gandel-worf.|It’s Gandolf, and he’s not coming.
So you’ve been sittin’ around here all mornin’?|No! I balanced my checkbook.
So what if he didn’t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!|Oh-no, y’know with Gandolf we’d be out all night!
Well, we could do that!|There’s other stuff too.
We’ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!|Yeah!
Yeah!|Yeah!!
Yeah!!|It’s not like we don’t know how to party!!
Yeah! All right? Let’s go!|And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?|Okay, the owner of Allesandro’s came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I’m soo happy!|Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
Ohh, you’ve waited soo long.|Hey!
Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.|Yeah.
How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale’s?|I don’t know, it would totally depend on her coloring and…  You got the job!!
Yes!!!|You got the job?! Why didn’t you tell me?
Ohh, it’s gonna be so great! I’m gonna get to help decide what we sell, I’m gonna have an office with walls and everything.  I’m gonna have walls!|Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
All right, so we’ll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we’ll head back out.|Yeah, all right.
So, we’re having fun, right?|Yeah.
We don’t need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we’ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.|I’m kinda beat.
Are you serious?!|Yeah.
Thank God! I’m exhausted!|So you guys want coffees?
Yeah, but uh, I don’t want to be up too late, so uh, I’ll have a decaf.|Yeah, me too.
I can’t hear a word you’re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.|I’m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y’know? I used them as mittens, I didn’t want to touch a thing in that last place.
Yeah, I know.|Y’know what? We’re not sad, we’re not sad, we’re just not 21 anymore. Y’know? I’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.|Yeah!
Ohh, here you are. Y’know, I’m-I’m glad you decided to hear me out.|Okay, I’m hearing.
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.|What?!
Or! A bakery delivery person.|I wa-I wa-I wa…
Pizza?!|Monica!
All right, I’ve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I’m getting the feeling that you don’t want to deliver.|No.
Okay. I’m guessing that if you don’t want to deliver, you probably don’t want to pick stuff up either.|No.
Y’know what, let’s do the catering business.|Really?! Are you sure?
Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y’know what, it’d be, it’d be fun.|Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let’s plan the wedding reception.  Y’know what, I want you to take the chef job.
Really?!|Yeah. That’s what you really want. Yeah, I don’t want to be the reason you’re unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don’t want to be the reason I’m unhappy.
Thank you.|Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?|Oh my goodness! You haven’t heard!
Heard what?|Joanna passed away last night.
Oh my God! How?!|Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!|I know!
Oh, God. Oh, God.  Oh God.|I didn’t realize that she was so close.
Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before… it happened.|No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she’d still be with us—nothing about an assistant buyer?|
Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn’t hear about Joanna…|I sure did!
I’m so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it’s like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we’re gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.|Umm, I just wanna say, uh  Are you gonna kill me?
Hey!|Hey!
I’m sorry I’m late, did I miss anything?|Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth.
15?|Where were you?
Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.|Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?
Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she’d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.|Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
No, I’m getting back down ‘cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she’s like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.|How can she be great if she’s from Poughkeepsie?  That joke would’ve killed in Albany.
Hey, look at this!  They’re lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.|Umm, that paper’s two weeks old.
All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I can’t believe I missed it.|Hey, y’know, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know it’ll be Valentine’s Day, then my birthday, then bang!—before you know it, they’re lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody!  I mean, it doesn’t even have to be a big relationship, y’know, just like a fling would be great.
Really?! I didn’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.|Well, believe me, it’s been a long time since I’ve been flung.
Y’know what? There’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?|Yeah! Wait a minute, it’s been a long time that I’ve been single. How come you never offered this before?
Well, I have a girlfriend, I’m-I’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.|Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I don’t like guys with boring jobs.
Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?|Hey!
Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who’s boss.|Hey, Mon! I’m not doing anything, why don’t you fire me?
I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now?  Og-ee-op, I’m not asking for me, I’m… I mean… No, I’m-I’m not gay, I’m not asking you out. I’m not-I’m not-I’m not gay!|I didn’t think you were gay. I do now.
See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.|Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, I’m not looking for any thing serious.
Oh, y’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?
Oh, by the way, that is her full name.|Oh wow! I’m free for her!
Oh well, that’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!|Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.
Hey! You guys, I’m writing a holiday song for everyone. Do you want to hear it?|Yes!
Happy Chanukah, Monica! May your Christmas be snowy, Joey! Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross. Spin the draddle, Rachel!|Pheebs, that’s great!
Oh, yay!|But y’know umm, Rachel doesn’t rhyme with draddle.
I know but it’s so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!|What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.
All good, thanks.  Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname that’s easier to rhyme?|Didn’t your dad used to call you Pumpkin?
Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?|Hello, children!
You work with robots!!|Okay, there’s this one guy, Patrick, I think you’re gonna like him, he’s really nice, he’s funny, he’s a swimmer.
No! No, the robots just work for them.|All right, I’m gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?
Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.|Oh yeah! With who?
You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?|Yeah.
Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I can’t decide between the two of them. Y’know the one from Poughkeepsie, even though she’s a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Y’know she’s, well she’s-she’s just as pretty, I guess she’s smart, she’s not fun.|If she’s no fun, why do you want to date her at all?
Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y’know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was—if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn’t kidding, she’s not fun, she’s stupid, and kind of a racist.|Hey!
Hey!|Hey, man!
Hey.|Hey.
Hey, what happened to your fancy chef’s jacket?|They baked it. I can’t take this anymore. I’m gonna call a meeting tonight, I’m gonna fire you tonight.
You got it! Oh-oh!|What are you doing?!
It’s still a tiny bit on fire there.|Thanks.  I think you got it!
Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!|Well, like father, like son.
Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.|Really?! I-I thought you weren’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
Well, y'know, possibly.  You didn’t tell him that, though? Right?|Ummmmmmmm, no.
You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You don’t tell the guy that!|Why not?! I’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to get—oh I see.
Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?|Yeah. Listen uh, I’d prefer it if you didn’t call me Joey. Since I don’t know anyone here, I thought it’d be cool to try out a cool work nickname.
Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight’s specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag—Why is nobody writing these down?|Because we can remember them.
Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?|Well, sure, that too.
Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right here’s the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm,  tried really hard to create a positive atmosphere…|Can’t hear you!
Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!|No ma’am.
What the hell happened?!|I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! It’s been a long time since I had…  327 + 238 dollars!"
Joey, we had a deal. That-that’s why you’re here! I’ve got to fire you!|And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don’t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they’ll start listening to all the nice things I’ve been saying about you.
What kinda things have you been saying?|Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.
Happy, happy Chanukah, Chandler and Monica. Very merry…|Oh, y’know, y’know what Pheebs?
What?|I’m not Jewish, so…
So! Ross doesn’t really decorate his tree with floss, but you don’t hear him complaining do you? God!|Bad dream?
So, did you pick one yet?|No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thought—it wasn’t that funny. So I’m still torn.
Well look, you don’t really like the one from uptown and you’re too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, you’re done!|Y’know, you’re right. Thank you.
Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.|Prague?
Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?|I did! I absolutely did!
You idiot!!|I’m sure you’re right, but why?
You don’t tell a guy that you’re looking for a serious relationship! You don’t tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!|Oh, man. I’m sorry, I’m so-so sorry.
Y’know, you should never be allowed to talk to people!|I know! I know!
Oh! See just I’m right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks!|Well, y’know, you’re-you’re gonna meet somebody! You’re a great catch! Y’know when I was telling all those guys about you, I didn’t have to lie once.
Really?|Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?
No.|Oh, it doesn’t matter.  Hey, y’know what, I’ve got two tickets to tonight’s Rangers game, you wanna come with me?
Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.|Well, actually it’s a hockey team, so it’s angry Canadians with no teeth.
Well that sounds fun too.|Have you ever been with a woman?
What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!|So there is no good time to ask that question.
The next station is Poughkeepsie. Poughkeepsie!|Ross! Ross!! Ross!!! Ross!!!!
I need more swordfish.  Can you get me some more swordfish?|I don’t speak English.
You did a minute ago!|Well, I don’t know what to tell ya!
Okay! Very funny! Somebody let me out please?! Come on, I’m cold!|You found that handle, did ya?
That’s not funny.|Well that’s not true.
I’m a good person. And I’m a good chef, and I don’t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y’know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is…|Hey! Chef Geller! Y’know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!
You do?|You bet I do! I just ah, wasn’t listening then, that’s all.
Well if you want a problem? I’ll give you a problem!|What are you gonna do? You’re gonna fire me?
You bet your ass I’m gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!!  All right! Anybody else got a problem? How ‘bout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?|No.
How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think it’s funny now?|No, it’s really good.
Last stop, Montreal. This stop is Montreal.|
Well I guess I should’ve thought about my wife and kids before I talked back to chef Geller!|Thanks.
Yep! Looks like it’s gonna be a leeeeean Christmas at the Dragon house this year.|Enough!
What the hell is that?!!|Boy, you are really not a morning person.
What is that noise?|You!
Hey!|Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
You guys you really should get rid of those animals. They shouldn’t be living in an apartment.|Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around…
All right. I’m gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I’m ready to have Frank and Alice’s embryo transferred into my uterus.|Now, how will they know if you’re ready?
Oh, they’re just gonna umm, look to see if my endometria layer is thick.|Oh, I can uh, check that for ya.
Okay everyone, think thick.|Good-bye! Good luck!
Hi! Wish me luck!|Oh, good luck.
It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.|Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.
Okay, it’ll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.|Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
Um-hmm, five actually.|Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.|That’s it! 25 percent? That means that’s it’s like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
No, I’m sorry.|Wow! You guys really don’t know anything!
You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?|Huh.
Same category?|According to Chandler, what phenomenon scares the bejeezus out of him?
Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance!|That is correct.
No!!|I’m afraid the TV Guide comes to Chinandolor Bong.
I knew that! Rachel! Use you’re head!|Actually, it’s Miss Chinandolor Bong.
Hello, tiny embryos. Well, I’m-I’m Phoebe Buffay, hi! I’m-I’m-I’m hoping to be your uterus for the next nine months. You should know, that we’re doing this for Frank and Alice, who you know, you’ve been there! Umm, y’know they want you so much, so when you guys get in there, really grab on. Okay, and-and I promise that I’ll keep you safe and warm until you’re ready to have them take you home, so… Oh! And also, umm next time you see me, I’m screaming, don’t worry, that’s what’s supposed to happen.|Ready?
All right, the score is nine to eight in favor of the guys. Ladies if you miss this the game is theirs, pick your category.|It’s All Relative!!
You don’t have to shout everything.|I’m sorry!
Ooh. What is the name of Chandler’s father’s Las Vegas all-male burlesque?|Viva Las Gaygas!

Why? Do you have the answers written on there?|No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me.

Oh-oh-oh, he’s a transponce—transpondster!|That’s not even a word! I can get this! I can get this!
Oh my God.|YEAH!!! YES!!!
I call Monica’s room!|You can’t just call Monica’s room.
Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, I’m sight of the room and I called it.|Man, I feel like I’m coming down with something.
What?|Yeah.  I bet you can’t guess what color my tonsils are? I’ll bet the apartment!
Hey—ooh Pheebs, are they in there?|Umm, yeah, uh-huh, they’re implanted.
Oh wow! You can tell this soon.|Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my body’s always been a little faster than Western medicine.
What?!|No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!
You can’t just ignore the bet! It’s a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!|Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we would’ve made them get rid of the birds. Right?
Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?|No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girl’s apartment! That is a boy’s apartment, it’s dirty and it smells. This is pretty. It’s-it’s so pretty! And look, and it’s-it’s purple! And I’m telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand.

How did it go?|I lost our mattresses.
"Are you in there little fetus?|Hey!
Oh. Oh.|Umm, it’s a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.
All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, y’know just remember that it’s still really early, okay so, if it says that I’m not pregnant, that doesn’t mean that I’m not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I don’t go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.|Okay.
Great.|Y’know what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!
You guys! You guys! You’re gonna have a baby! They’re gonna have a baby!|MY SISTER’S GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!
Okay, but this can’t be good for the baby.|Oh!
I can’t find garbage bags!|Oh, I think I saw some in here.
What is it?!|I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die.
What?! What-what is it?!|Did you see the size of the closets?!
I can’t believe we live here!|Awwwww!!  Awwwwwww!!!
What the hell is that?!!|Boy, you are really not a morning person.

Wow! She looks great. Doesn’t she?|Yeah.
Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!|Sooo, you’ve been doing this long?
Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?|Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?
Well, it’s just that maternity clothes are so expensive.|Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could just……throw your purses at it.
Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?|Uh-huh.
That sounds great!|
Hey!|Hey!
Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin’ guy.|Yeah, it’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!
Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.|Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Yeah.|Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.
They’re not a couple!|Oh-okay, I get the game now.
Oh yeah!|Well okay, so then you’re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it’s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It’s when the heat goes away, that’s when you’re in trouble.
No.|Noooo!!
So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?|Y’know what, I don’t know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
Yeah, I know but…|Oh no-no-no, I’m there.
Okay, okay, but don’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I’m fairly certain are the same thing.|Listen also we’re uh, we’re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.
Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.|In a moment, please, I’m in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.
Hi!|Hi, I’m Joshua.
Hi, I’m Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?|Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wife…
Oh, I’m so sorry.|Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.
Well, at least that’s a great suit.|Yeah, but it wasn’t much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt.  So I need everything down to underwear, so if you’re willing, I’m all yours.
Okay.|Rachel, you needed to speak to me?
Oh-oh, sorry, it’s this way, it’s this way.|It’s this way? Sorry.
I’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now there’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!|All right, let’s not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.
Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!|Here she comes. Don’t say a word, okay? Just be cool, don’t be…y'know you.
Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly you’re having sex with him.|Okay, I…
Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!|Okay, so let me just get this straight. You’re accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
Y’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know you’re up there every night, you’re naked, touching, kissing.|Acting! Chandler, this is my job! I’m-I’m playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!
Well, you can understand, given how we started.|Oh, wow. I can’t believe you’re throwing that in my face.
Well, that is what happened, and I don’t even see you denying this!|I’ll tell you what, Chandler, why don’t you call me when you grow up!
I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!|Rachel has a new doll.
Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.|Uh, hello!
Hi-e!!|Ooh, what do I smell?
Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.|Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?
It’s Joshua.|Oh, whatever.
Why? Honey, what is the big deal?|I’m the hostess! Not those guys! I’m always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.
Yeah, that’s true.|All right then, when I’m done with this place, it’s gonna be ten times better than that place!
Chandler, what did she say?|Wait a minute.
Beefsteak Charlie’s?|Yes! See you and I have always been like—
Whoops.  Oh, hey, do you need help with that?|Nah, I got it.
Hi!|Hey!
So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. It’s just so frustrating!|Why don’t you ask him out?
Really? It doesn’t seem desperate?|Oh-ooh, that’s the turn-on.
Hmm-mmm.|So he’s probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.
Yeah but, I’ve never asked a guy out before.|You’ve never asked a guy out?!!
No. Have you?|Thousands of times!! That doesn’t make me sound too good does it?
I don’t even know how I would go about it.|Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin’?"
You know what, I’m gonna do that, I’m gonna call him up, and I’m gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out.  You’ve done that a thousand times?|I’ve never done that.
Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.|Well, you gotta give him something that he can’t say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, you’re guaranteed he’ll say yes!
Really?! You think that will work?|Absolutely! And if it doesn’t, can I get the extra ticket?
Did she call?|No, sorry.
All right, maybe I should call her.|No! Forget her, man! You don’t need her, you don’t need that!
Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?|How might you be wrong?
Well y'know, what if she didn’t actually sleep with the guy?|Dude, tell me she actually told you this.
She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!|That’s all you’re basing this on?
That’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.|Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! There’s a lot of theories that didn’t pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.
Would you like to go to a basketball game with me?|What do you think?
Oh! Well, as a single woman, who is available, I think you look great!|Huh.  Yeah?
Yep. Oh, yeah, look you great.  Umm, so you like it?|I do. I do. I love it. In fact, I think I’m gonna wear it home.
Great.|All right, thank you so much for all your help.
Sure.|Well, I guess this is uh, I guess this is it.
Yeah-eah-ha!|Thanks.  Maybe I’ll see in the spring, with the uh, y’know, for the uh, bathing suits.
Oh well, you don’t want to do that now?!|Ah, that’s okay, thanks.
Okay.|Anyway, hopefully, I’ll see you around sometime.
Basketball!|I’m sorry.
I uh, I have two tickets to the Knicks game tonight if you’re interested, just as a thank you for this week.|Wow! That would be great.
Really?|Yeah, that would be fantastic! My-my nephew is crazy about the Knicks! This is fantastic, thank you so much Rachel.
Hey.|Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that I’m sorry. Y’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.
Oh wow. I really wish you’d call me.|Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but y’know I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? ‘Cause we’ve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Y’know, I know for me— Nick’s pants?
Yeah.|Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!
Okay, for next time, what do you say?|I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.
What’s ready?|Just come.
I don’t know, it looks the same.|You used to have carpet.
Oh yeah!|So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? I’m just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.
How’d it go?|Well, she wasn’t sleeping with him.
Rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. A Joshua Bergen.|Really?
Will you call him?|Yes! I will! Absolutely!  Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really? Yes, I just wanted to see you again. Oh, I’m glad. Rachel, I’d like to say something to you. Yes? How you doin’?
So now, what is this now?|Guggly worm.
And this?|Glow-pop giggly jammer.
You make it so funny.|Hey umm, what’s this?
So, these will match the jacket you picked out for me last week?|Um-hmm.  There we go. There it is.
Oh! You know what I need?|Yeah!
Gloves. Brown, leather dress gloves.|Oh, okay. Uhh, well let’s see.
Also large?|Yeah! Okay, two larges coming right up!
Okay.|Rachel! Could I have a moment?
So…|So?
Gloves?|Ohh! Right! Right, sorry, I’ll be right back!
Uhh, actually y’know what, I kinda—I have to take off.|Oh.
But, I was curious; do you have any plans for tonight?|No! Nothing!
I invested in this night-club and it’s opening tonight, would you like to come?|Yeah! That would be great!
You’re into hardcore S&M right?|Well, I-I guess—I…
Kidding!  I’m gonna get there early, but I’m going to put you on the V.I.P list, okay? Look for me.|Yeah, great, you betcha!
Y’know, I can’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on I’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!|Come on, man! Just-just take the sweats off. Okay? Just take ‘em off and we’ll have some fun.
Ohh!|What?
It kicked! I think the baby kicked!|Oh my God!
Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.|Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!
Why?|The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.
Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?|No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "I’m Rachel Greep! I’m Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.
Aww, Pheebs.|Honey, that’s you’re name.
That’s short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!|Hey! You’re wearing pants!
Shhh!! Please! What’s he saying?|He’s with Emily at a Bed and Breakfast in Vermont!
What? Oh my God!|What? Who the hell is Emily— noooo!!
They’re in Vermont!! How could this happen?!|Ow!
How—how did end up in Vermont with that awful witch?!|Maybe, she doesn’t hit him all the time.
When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldn’t be miserable? I’m telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.|Ross! Come quickly! There’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!
He had to go, there’s a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard.|I don’t get this! She was horrible!
Why do you care so much anyway?|I don’t care! All right, y’know what I’m just upset that I’m getting nowhere with Joshua that—y’know what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!
Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.|Oh, y’know, would you just for once, not remember every…little…thing!!
A couple of days.|Y’know, I knew something like this was going to happen.
What are you doing?! Chandler! You can’t just go back a phase!|Yes you can. You’re thinking about time, you can’t go back in time.
Yeah, come on, we can be guys!|No you can’t.
Hey! Joey Tribbiani! I’m here! I’m here!|Calm down, we got time, we’re running a little late.
Look at that, Charlton Heston eating a liquorice whip!|Yeah, we loves ‘em. I’ve never seen him with—
Whoa! Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?|You.
Y’know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?|You?
No-no, it’s uh, it’s Heston.|What?
Yeah, the man wreaks! Smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.|There’s no way he smells, he’s the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.
Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?|The one with "Heston" on it.
Okay, I’ve got some Ones, you wanna put them in her panties?|No thanks, Mom!
Very good,  so good.|I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.
When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.|Remember, a virgin for me please.
Oh! And don’t let me leave without getting the name of that carpet guy.|Ahh, come on! Y’know what—y’know what, I think I’m just gonna go home and call Kathy.
Hello! Who’s in there?|How ya doin’?
Who in the hell are you?|I guess you wouldn’t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?
Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.|No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I’m an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I’m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.
You’re in this picture?|Yeah-yeah, I’m one of the cops that won’t work with you ‘cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I’m really sorry, but I stink!
Joey, right?|Yeah.
Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won’t even watch himself.|Oh no-no-no, you don’t understand…
Listen to me!|Oh yeah, yeah.
I don’t know one actor worth his salt that didn’t say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!|Yes sir! Yes sir, I’m-I’m—
Wait a minute! Take your pants.|Yeah. Oh, yeah.
So, we did okay at the strip club, right?|Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!
What, he doesn’t like Josh?|No, I don’t.
Yeah. And y’know, if you wanna cry, that’s okay too.|Okay, look, I’m gonna have to ask you all to leave.
Come on! Chandler!|Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldn’t picture myself with any of them.
They really were pretty, weren’t they?|Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.
Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!|Yeah.
Y’know, I think if I were going to be with a woman.  It’d, it’d be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.|See, I don’t know, for me it would have to Chantal.
Oh, Chantal!|Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thigh…
Really?!|I am totally picturing you with all those women!
That’s-that’s not Phase Three.|Well, I’m there too!
Come on, let me see that smile.|I don’t wanna.
Please?|I wanted to go to the strip club!
I know, I know, but you’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.|Yeah, all right.
All right ladies, here’s what we’re gonna do.  And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandler’s the king! Chandler’s the king!"|I-I wanna be with her,  I like her.
Oh, that’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.|Wait, now, what am I doing again?
Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!|Hi, I’m Joshua, I’m here to pick up Rachel.
What do you want from me, I’ve never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, I’m sorry you can’t stay,  All right, listen, I’ve got to wake up!|Wil Calhoun
Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And you said it was gonna be fun!  Which it kinda is.  Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!|Chandler, there’s a guy right over there.
That’s a mailman! That’s our mailman!  Hi. How are ya?|Chandler, don’t worry! This doesn’t make you any less of a guy!  I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?|Hmm.
Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?|Ohh, Nothing.
Didn’t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?|I know what it did! Nothing.
They wouldn’t have put it there if it didn’t do something! How can you not care?|Like this.
Janice?!|Isn’t this amazing?
How have you been?|Oh well, I’m divorced.
I can’t believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.|No, it’s really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home.  Liam, Devon, this is Ross.|Hey, mate.
So how are you? I’ve been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I’ve been rather busy.|Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
Oh my God. I think you’re right.|Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
Oh, Liam.|Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something—or should I call it  football?
Ross play rugby? I don’t think so.|What’s ah, what’s so funny about that?
Well I mean, you’re American to start with. You don’t even have rugby here.|Well, we didn’t have freedom here until 1776, either so…
Oh boy, I just love to sing!|Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
Oh, look at us! Who would’ve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.|Okay, we have to talk. I’m just getting out of a very serious relationship…
I know! And I’m just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!|Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.|I hear ya.  But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
Oh no! Where to?  Too Paris?|No! No! Not, Paris.
Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?|Okay, could you just stop talking for a second?  Yemen. That’s right, yes, I’m being transferred to Yemen!
When?|I don’t know exactly.
Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.|But I do know that it’s some time tomorrow.
Done?|Yep!
This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don’t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.|I bet I stopped listening before you did.
Yeah, well, I’m using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go.|It’s coming from Joey!
Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.|Oh, just hold on a second. I’m watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don’t know what the big deal is. I’m man enough to play this sport.
Janice.|Y’know uh, you didn’t really have to help me pack.
Yeah, I know, I do that ‘cause it makes me look taller.|Okay, Chandler, come on!
Well, why are you doing this anyway?|Well, you should’ve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he’s like Joe Rugby.
You’re kidding! And he plays rugby?! That’s so funny.  Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.|Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I’m gonna show her how tough I really am!
Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy . And that one—Dude! They’re all huge!|They don’t look any bigger than me!
Well, maybe that’s because you’re closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.|I’m just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
I totally don’t know what you’re talking about.|Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
No.|You’ll see.
Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it’s his first time.|You don’t say!
Good luck, babe.|Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here!  Ross! Come on!
You…are…not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?|He asked you out?!
No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.|Saucy!
What are these?|Electrical plans for the building.
Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?|I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
Y’know you, really didn’t have to take me to the airport.|Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y’know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.
Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.|On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.
Okay. Then I guess it’s just, wait here then.  Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.|One ticket to Yemen?
Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.|I’m sorry sir, I don’t understand.
What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?|Are you travelling with a child?
No. All right, y’know what, she’s  gonna think that I’m handing you a credit card, but what I’m really gonna do is hand you a library card.|Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don’t take library cards.
I can’t believe they’re doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!|No offence but, y’know sometimes it’s hard to understand you, y’know with the accent, so…
That’s just halftime, there’s more of this.|Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
Right.|Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
Okay.|Thanks.  I-I think I’m dying. I really do.
Ross, they are killing you out there!|That’s not true!
All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.|No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
No. That’s not what I’m saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.|I like that.
Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.|Huh?
One swift kick and he’ll back off.|All right, bad ankle, got it!
And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn’t wear a cup.|Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
And uh, Liam, Liam’s got bad knees. You hit him right and he’ll go down like a lamp.|But-but, Liam’s on my team.
I don’t care! You just get him!|I’m gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
Hey!|Hi!
What-what are-what are these?|Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they’d brighten up the place. They do don’t you think?
Oh my God! Look at this!|Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
I don’t care! The wires have come loose in your head!|I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
And did you?!|No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
Oh my God.|Hello darling.
Now, are you sure you don’t want to go see a doctor?|Oh no! That-that’ll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y’know what? I’m buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it’s in my pocket.
Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!|You were amazing out there.
This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.|Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
All right. The super couldn’t figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn’t figure out what it did. I’ve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.|Thank God.
What is it hon?|I-I can’t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I’m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake—ooh! Cake!  No.
Aww, honey I’m sorry.|God! Ooh! What is that smell? It’s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
Yeah?|It’s me. It’s Phoebe. Listen there’s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
Is it the shampoo? It’s guava.|No!
Oh! Wait-wait!  Is it my bologna sandwich?|Yes. Yes. Yes. I can’t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can’t eat meat!
What are you writing?|Well, Joshua’s coming in tomorrow and since I don’t have the guts to ask him out, I’m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
Hi guys!|Hey!
Without me?!|My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
Yes, but in Ross’s case, they both know in two weeks that’s it.|Pheebs!
Maybe that’s because soy-burgers suck!|Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
Okay!|Oh, here’s that trench-coat that you wanted.
Oh great!  Wow! Yeah, it’s comfortable.|Yeah?
Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.|Oh no-no, no-no, they don’t want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
Why not?!|Well, that’s because of a lot of…
Y’know, they ruin it for everybody.|I know!
Y’know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.|Oh?
Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.|Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
No, no, no, she’s nice but, y’know, it just it made me realize that I’m just not, I’m just not ready to be dating, y’know?|Huh. Well, uh, that’s uh, that’s interesting.
Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?|Oh, it’s just an anti-theft device.
Then uh, what’s-what’s this?|You need that, you need that too ‘cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.|What are you talking about?
We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it’s actually for Joshua.|Well, as much as I’d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren’t going to be here. All right? I mean, she’s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I’ve got a whole special evening planned. So I’m sorry, no party.
Surprise!!!|Surprise!!
Well, it was all Ross’s idea.|You’re so sweet! And I’m so surprised!
Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?|Uhh, because I’m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he’s looking over here, say something funny.
Like what?|What-what-what is so funny?
I said, "Like what?"|Now that’s a thinker.
Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?|A little salami.
Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?|Pastrami.
Oooh, yeah. You’re a genius.|Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
All right. Who wants to go first?|I’ll go.
Yay! Emily!|What are the odds? What are the odds?
Okay, my turn!!|Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
It’s okay! It’s okay! It kicked once, it’ll kick again!|Oh my God!
Y’know it doesn’t matter how much I’m craving it. Y’know why I’m never gonna eat meat? Because it’s murder, cold blooded murder.|Okay.
I can’t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.|All right look, y’know how-y’know how when you’re dating someone and you don’t want to cheat on them, unless it’s with someone really hot?
Yeah, totally!|All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you’re going to do something wrong,  do it right!
Feel better now?|Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I’m gonna eat like, y’know millions of cows.
Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.|What?
Well, I eat a lot of meat right?|Yeah.
Well, suppose until the baby’s born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you’d just be eating my animals.|Joey, I can’t believe you would do that for me.
Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.|But, we can’t go now. It looks like Rachel’s gonna put on a skit.
So, this was uh, really fun.|Oh, yeah! Real fun.
Need uh, need a little hand there.|Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
You really don’t seem like you do. That’s…|Ughhhh!! Forget it!  This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
Well, what was supposed to happen?|Can you not look at me when I say this?  I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
Huh. Oh, boy!  Uhh, I-I don’t wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.|Well, I’m sorry, I thought you needed them!
No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.|Why?!
Because I-I like you.|You like me?
Yeah! I mean you’re-you’re beautiful and smart and sophisticated—a lot of this isn’t based on tonight.|Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can’t believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
But…|Oh no-no-no don’t say but! No-no, but’s never good! Let’s just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
Okay uh, however…|Oh, now see that’s a fancy but.
My marriage like just ended, and I’m really not ready to get into anything yet.|But….
I’m sorry, I, I just need a little time.|Okay.
Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua’s gone so you and Emily are free to go.|That’s okay. She’s still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it’s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so…
Oh, Ross, I’m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.|Yeah.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.|Helps a little.
Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?|Yeah, have a seat.
I’m so sorry.|That’s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn’t want it to end this way, y’know?
Well, maybe you didn’t want it to end?|What do you mean?
You seem to really like her.|Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.|You think?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.|Hey, you’re right.
Yeah.|Thanks.  What photo album was it?
I don’t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.|Oh my God! Those weren’t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
Hey.|Hey.
You’re a pathetic loser, right?|Oh-ho, yeah!
Sit!|Hi.
Oh my gosh, Joshua!|All those things I said about not being ready…
They’re not true?|No, they’re-they’re all true.
Oh.|But…
You wanna go inside and have some coffee?|Yeah.
Oooh, what you got there?|Pastrami.
Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y’know what goes good with that?|Hm-mm, corn beef.
Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that’s much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?|Okay.
Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?|Six months.
Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?|Not if I get there first.
Ohhh, man!!|What is that?
What in the name of hell?|Maybe he found you flip-flop.
Whoa, hey, that lady’s all kinds of naked.|Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.|Like finding money with naked people on it!
Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I’m sad.|
All right, y’know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?|Oh no-no-no-no!
Honey, what are you doing? That’s too heavy.|Yeah.
Give it here.|Okay.
Hi.|Hi.
So uh, Emily just went to the airport.|Oh. Why didn’t you take her?
Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y’know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so…|You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
Nah.|Hey, cheer up! You’re gonna see her again, right?
Well I, that’s the thing, I don’t know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said,  "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let’s just enjoy…"|No-no-no, don’t-don’t do the accent. You’ve got to see her again.
And why do you care so much?|Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
You had fantasies about Emily?|No! Y’know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?|Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
Ahh.|Do you love her?
We said it was only going to be two weeks, y’know?|You love her!
What-what is love really?|Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You’re probably just gonna catch her just as she’s about to go to the gate. You’re gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she’s gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
I am a good kisser.|Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in…  I’ve been watching too much porn.
Is that the heartbeat?|That’s it.
Oh wow! This is so cool.|Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!|Definitely.
Oh-oh, Phoebe!|Ooh! Hi!
Hi!  So, how did it go at the doctors?|Oh well, okay, hey, y’know how when you’re umm, you’re walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that’s nice?"
Three babies?|I finally got my band!
We’re gonna have a big family, I’ve always wanted a big family!|Oh God, I’m so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
Right.|No, back to happy. Back to happy!
No-no-no, no, it’s going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y’know it’ll-it’ll be like my very own little sweatshop.|Yeah, I’ve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
No, Frank.|No you can’t quit college! No! You’re in college? Really?
Yeah.|Yeah, y’know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y’know I figured y’know like I should y’know have like a career—and I love refrigerators!
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.|Emily!
This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.|Well, that’ me.
What’s that song? It has been in my head all day long.|It’s the theme from Good Will Humping.
Y’know who doesn’t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.|Yeah right.
No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.|Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
Yes!|Yeah, he likes porn.
I’m going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny.  Hey, Pheebs!|Hey.
Hey!|Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
Well, so, why don’t you just turn it off?|Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
Well, what-what ‘cha got there?|Oh this, well I’m glad you asked.  Ahh! Now, I know what you’re thinking…
Honey, you’re not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.|No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
Hello?|Ross.
Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?|It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
No, no, that-that, that’s all right. Umm, I’m just glad you called.|Ross umm, there’s something that I’ve got to tell you, there’s-there’s someone else.
She doesn’t know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.|This isn’t how it’s supposed to go, there can’t be another guy.
Well…|Of course there’s another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
I’m not proving anything. Okay, I’m done listening to you. If I hadn’t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would’ve put my fist through the wall!|You put your fist through the wall?
No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!|You have to go to London!
What?|Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
I made fun of his accent.|You sat back and let him have her, you didn’t fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
No.|All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily!  That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
Really?|Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don’t let her go without a fight!
All right. All right, I’m gonna do it!|All right.
I’m gonna, I’m gonna go to London and I’m going to fight for her.|Okay, good luck!
Hey!|Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I’m gonna open up my own massage place and Frank’s gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn’t have to quit school!
Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised…|I’m telling it! I’m telling it!
Okay.|Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I’ve got?
Relaxi-Taxi!|The name was my favourite part!
Well, well I can up with it!|YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That’s not good.
Well, I…|Hello.
No, because she hasn’t come home yet. And she hasn’t been home all night! She’s obviously staying with that other guy, and I’m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!|All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
About four hours.|Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn’t show up by then, then just come on home.
Are we in London?|What are you doing here? You can’t be here!
Ross, are you there? Ross, I don’t know if you can hear this but…  I’m gonna talk anyway, uh, I’m in the States with you sister and your friends and it’s all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you—Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.|
I wish I could know if you’d heard any of that. I suppose I’ve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you’re listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there’s not much chance you did heard that, and there’s the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well.  Hello.|Hi.
Ross, I love you!|Ohh! Thank you.
Hey.|Hey.
I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.|Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"|Noo! Nothing!
Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.|I think you’re right.
All right, ready?|One.
Two.|Three.
Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.|Yeah.
You wanna see if we still have it?|Yeah.
FREE PORN!!!|Yeah!!
We have free porn here!!!|Jill Condon & Amy Toomin
Hey!|Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum.
No, it’s just I’m so pregnant that I—my guitar doesn’t fit anymore. So I thought ‘til I’m not, I’m just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!|All right.
Listen. Listen.  Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?|Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!
I know! I know, and I’ve only been playing for like an hour!|Phoebe! Phoebe! Hi! Hi!
Hey! What are you doing here?|Umm, actually, I came down to ask you a big favour.
Oh, well, don’t tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.|Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.
Wow! That’s so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.|You think about it.
I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don’t think your son will think it’s yours and be horribly traumatised?|Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
Ohh, it’s time to go.|Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clock’s a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?
Well that’s ambitious.|Hey, uh, you can ignore that.
That’s Carol with your son!|Uhh, believe me when he’s older, he’ll understand.
Me too!|Ohh, y’know, Susan’s gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.
Oh, well, I’ll show you around.|That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestions…
Oh, there’s tonnes of terrific stuff—I’ll go with you!|Ahh!
Are you all right?|Oh, he’s fine. He’s fine. It’s just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesn’t like me.
Hi!|Hey!
Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book  and found nothing! I want a name that’s really like, y’know strong and confident, y’know? Like-like Exxon.|Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.
No, I’m-I’m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."|Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey’s your pal. Joey’s your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, they’re hanging out with Joey."
Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names.  But, all right, I don’t—maybe I’ll just name him The Hulk.|I knew I shouldn’t have mentioned it! That’s what I wanted to name my kid!
Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing.|Y’know what? It really creeps me out choosing other people’s sex clothes.
Sorry. I’m so exited! I’ve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! I’m making him a very fancy meal.|Um-hmm.
What am I making him by the way?|Well, you’re making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.
I thought I was making him filet mignon?|Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.
Hey!|Hey!
So uh, Emily called last night…|And now you’re giving me the message!
Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, they’re going to the theatre together! They’re going to dinner! They’re going horseback riding!|God, Susan is so fun!
Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."|You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
Hey, they’re going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Y’know they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playful—didn’t you see Personal Best?|No, but I’m gonna!
How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!|Yeah, I definitely. I don’t like the name Ross.
What a weird way to kick me when I’m down.|No! No! I-I meant for the baby!
Oh. What’s wrong with Ross?|Well, it’s just y’know that something like this would never to like The Hulk, y’know…
Actually that-that’s not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner found…|So, I decided I’m definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.
This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.|Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me.  Ahh. So, dig in!
Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!|Hmmm!
Oh my God!|Oh I know, my God, this is so—this rice is so—I am so good.
Behind you?|Oh, yeah, I’m sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.
Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. It’s just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!|Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.
All gone! So, farm birds, huh?|Yeah, it’s-it’s my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I would’ve told you about it, but I didn’t know they would be here.
Oh.|So, all right.
Okay. So, can I serve you a little of—What? What? What?|Nothing I uh, it’s just that I know that they’re still out there.
But, they’re across the hall! I mean that’s two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.|Okay, that’s-that’s not funny. Uhh.
Okay, y’know, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and y’know go to your apartment.|Oh, they’re working on this week, it’s a total mess. But uh, I’m staying at my parents’ house, we could go there.
Your parents’?|Yeah, they’re out of town.
Ohh.|Yeah-yeah, it’s this huge place, and-and it’s got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?
Yeah that works.|They-they-they can smell fear.
Hey!|Hey! How’s Ben?
Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, he’s sweeping.|Hey, Ben! Hey!
So umm, any word from Susan?|Ooh, yeah! She said she’s having sooo much fun with Emily.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I don’t know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?|What’s too much fun?
Y’know, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.|Oh my God, you are so paranoid!
Am I?!|Yes!
Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Y’know? Say-say they’re coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, they’re laughing, y’know, someone innocently touches someone else… There’s electricity, it’s new. It’s exciting. Are you telling me there isn’t even the slightest possibility of something happening?|Maybe.
…and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!|Wow! This place is fabulous!
Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.|Whoa-whoa, there’s two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place must’ve been a real babe magnet.
Yeah, well, it would’ve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.|Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?
Hey, here’s an idea. Why don’t uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?|That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?
Oh yeah, yeah uh, it’s down the hall and uh, second door to your left.|Ah.
Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?|Oh, well we cut the trip short.
Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.|Oh, say no more!
Oh, that-that would be great. So you didn’t even get to Italy?|Yep, sucks!
Oh my God!|I know, I can do more than cook.
Uhh, Rachel, my parents…|Ohh! It’s so nice to meet you.  Hello.
There you go.|So, have you kids eaten yet?
Dude, I am sorry about what I said!|No, no, you’re right, it is a ridiculous name!
It’s not that bad.|Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.
So, you’re just Bing?|I have no name.
No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.|Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?
See you later, Gene.|Bye, Gene.
So, you wore your nightie to dinner?|Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.
Oh, no!|No, it’s all right. I got nice boobs.
Emily’s straight.|Oh, wake up!
This totally makes sense!|It does not!
Oh, sure it does! In high school, you weren’t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!|All right, all right, so up until ‘92-93 he was very trusting, then ’94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!
This is so much fun!|This is not fun!
Look, all we’re trying to say is, don’t let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.|Yeah. The ’92 Ross wouldn’t.
Drum roll.|Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?
You’re actually going through with this?|Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, it’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with women… So, as of 4 o’clock tomorrow, I’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.
You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In fact—yes,  I’m, I’m sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, I’m-I’m, I’m gonna, I’m gonna name the baby Chandler.|Really?!
Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!|Okay. Thanks.
Okay!|You wanna hug it out?
Yay!|Yay!
Yay—oh—yay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!|Okay!
Ooh, uh…|Bye, Pheebs!
Okay, bye!|Ha! Ha! Ha!
Nice luggage.|I was gonna say…
Hi!|Hey! I missed you.
Oh, I missed you too.|Thanks for everything, I had such a great time.
Morning’s here! Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning’s here! The morning’s here!|HEY!! Do you have to do that? It’s Saturday!
Oh come on! Morning’s here!  Morning’s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!|I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
Oh, blimey, I still can’t believe you’ve got an earring!|Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
He does that?!|Uh, I don’t know, whatever.
I think it makes you look really dangerous.|Oh, I know. Y’know what, I never would’ve gotten this if it weren’t for you. No really, when I’m with you I’m-I’m like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
I love both of you!|Yeah?
I wish I didn’t have to go.|Then don’t. Stay here. Just don’t go so soon to London, just one more day.
Ohh, Ross, please!|One more day, seriously/
Don’t do this to me, again. You’d know I’d stay here in a minute, but I’d really miss so much work, they’ll fire me.|So, then you can stay as long as you want.
I wish I could.|Oh no. Don’t, don’t, don’t start packing. Come on!
I don’t think you understand packing. Look, I just don’t want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.|Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
You didn’t!|No. No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to be that guy.
Hello!|Ho! Ho! Ho!
Excuse me.|Your pants!
Oh, yeah! You like ‘em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!|Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
What?|Santa pants.  Santa Claus’s pants.
Nuh-uh! They’re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names.  Ohh.|Hey!
I don’t know! How are the-the-the-the, y’know—You’re clothes aren’t funny.|Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?
Boy! I didn’t see that coming!|Are you serious?
Come on!|Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?|Forget it! Okay, I’m not giving up the apartment.
Oh come—look, when I was a kid my dad’s company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn’t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!|
Hey!|Oh my God!
We don’t make enough fun of you already?|Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
Oh-no, don’t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.|Where is Emily?
What?|I could ask her to live with me!
All right look, Ross, he’s right. Emily’s great, she’s great! But this way too soon, you’re only gonna scare her!|I don’t want to do that.
No! You don’t want to wreck it, you don’t want to go to fast!|Yeah, no, you’re right, I know, you’re right, I’m not, I’m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
That’s too hard. Too hard!|All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?|No. No. We’re not gonna do that, y’know why? Because its not an even trade.
Or you could end up with everything.|Ooh, I like that.
Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?|Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she’s the only who’s impartial, and she’s so pretty.
Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh—oh, I have a game!|Okay!
This is great!|What’s the game?! What’s the game?!
Oh, well, it doesn’t have a name—oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn’t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?|They’re green?
All right, Joey, same question.|Uhh, they’re tall.
Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.|That’s not even a game!
Oh, I have cards!|Oh.
Yeah! Here!  Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.|Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first
What make you think I can?!|Okay. Okay.  Ace!
I don’t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it!  Ah-ha!|All right, cut, let’s pick again, pick again.
Hey!|I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
Move in with me.|What?!
Don’t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it’s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.|Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
I know.|My job!
Well, so, you-you’ll get a job here! I mean, I’m always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!|Yeah, but it-it-it’s my whole life—you come to England.
No, I can’t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can’t leave him. Isn’t—you don’t think there’s any way?|Ohh, I don’t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future –and-and-and we were getting married or something.
What?|Oh no, no, right I shouldn’t have said married. Uh, please don’t go freaky on me. I didn’t mean it. Well, I didn’t say it; I take it back!
No, no, don’t. Why don’t we?|Why don’t we what?
Get married.|You are mad!
No! No! I’m not! It’s-it’s-it’s perfect! I mean it’s better than you just-just moving here, ‘cause it’s us together forever, and that’s-that’s what I want.|We’ve only known each other for six weeks!
Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who’s-who’s to say? Does that me we-we can’t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn’t it?|My parents are going to be really mad.
Is that—are you saying yes? Is that yes?|Yes.
Yes! We’re getting married?!|Oh my God!
Yes!|We’re getting married!
Come here, come here. Uh,  ow! Emily, will you marry me?|Yes.
Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!|It was.
Those were like the best seats ever.|Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y’know, kinda like a peace offering.
Oh. Oh, God!|Hey, want a beer?  WHOA!!!!
Open up! Open up! Open up!|We’ll discuss it, in the morning!
What the hell is going on?!|We took our apartment back!!
We are switching back, right now!|No, we’re not! We’re not leaving!
Well, you’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we’re switching it back! There’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?|I don’t know.
What?|I don’t want to move again!
I don’t care, this is our apartment! And they stole—you stole it—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I’m getting back right now!|All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can’t offer anything to us!|Let us keep the apartment and…
Totally worth it!|That was one good minute!
Good night.|Good night.
Men are such idiots.|Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
Yeah, let-let-let’s pretend that’s not true.|Yeah.
What-what’s going on?|Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.
When, when did—how, how did you…|We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
I can’t believe you’re getting married!|Yeah.
Morning’s here! The morning’s here!|Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morning’s here!
Hey! You’re back!|Hey!  Get into gear!
Breakfast is near!|The dark of night has disappeared!!
I’ll see you tomorrow morning!|Okay!
Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!|Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!
Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please?  So uh, what do you do when you’re not working here?|You don’t need to fill these silences.
Oh, okay, thanks.|Chandler, that’s like your fourth cup of coffee!
Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!|He’s in a different room! He’s really that loud?
It’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!|Look, I told ya, I’m not going to any clinic! I don’t have a problem, you’re the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
They don’t have those.|Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you’ve just had your first class!
Next time you snore, I’m rolling ya over!|I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.
Hey, all right!|Hey!
Oh, she’s got you running errands, y’know, picking up wedding dresses…  Wah-pah!|What’s wah-pah?
Y’know, whipped! Wah-pah!|That’s not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!
That’s what I did. Wah-pah!|You can’t do anything!
Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!|Hey!
Oh! It’s you.  Hi.|Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?
Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, so…|So listen uh, I know you and I haven’t really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.
Oh.|I know if you were getting married I’d feel, kinda….. y’know.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but I’m okay.|Yeah?
Yeah.|All right, I just wanted to check.
Oh, that’s sweet.|You’re great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.
Uhh, hang in there?|Oh, no, I didn’t mean, uh…
I mean maybe you didn’t hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?|Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didn’t realise that had become anything, yet.
Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it has—yeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.|Oh. Yeah?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean y’know, emotionally, mentally, physically…|Wow, that’s-that’s-that’s incredible.
I know isn’t it? It’s like I’m right there with Joshua.|Uh-huh.
You are right there with Emily. And it’s y’know, it’s kinda like…. it’s a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.|I gotta get to work.
Oh yeah? Fine.|Hey, y’know, y’know what would make me really happy?
Oh yeah, no, what’s that?|If like the four of us could all y’know, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emily’s coming into town this weekend, why don’t you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?
That would be great!|Yeah, all right, it’s a date.
|Did you say something?
Oh my God! Ohh! Look at this one! It’s so beautiful!|Yeah, but y’know, about have of these are gonna end up getting divorced.
Oh, yes, umm, I’m here to pick up a dress that you have on hold.|Yes, what’s the name, please?
Emily Waltham.|Yes! I have it right here.  Would you like to try it on Ms. Waltham?
You’re the most beautiful bride I’ve ever seen.|I am, aren’t I?
Oh. Thank you. Ohhh, thank you very much. Oh, thank you for coming.  Uh, just a second!|No-no, let me in!
Phoebe?|Yeah!
Can you just hold on for one minute?|No, you have to let me in right now!!
Are you alone?|Yes!
This sucks! I didn’t know I had to stay up all night before I went to this stupid sleep clinic! I’m so tired!|It’s 6:00.
Yeah, well…|Hi!
Yeah, Rach, I think you’re handling that really well.|Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There’s nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn’t for me and Joshua. Y’know, they’re not gonna get married anyway!
I am…  free!|Great! Because Emily and I are getting married in a month!
Hey, Rachel.|Hi!
What’s up? You’re voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.|Ohh, nothing, I just wanted to see you. See you and hug you.  See you.
Great!|Yeah!  Sit!
You okay?|I’m more than okay, I am really, really happy! Wanna know why?
Do I?|‘Cause I am really happy about us. I think we are, I think we are so on the right track! Y’know? I mean, I think we are working, I think we are clicking. Y’know?
Yeah, sure-sure, yeah, we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re-we’re clicking.|Yeah-yeah, y’know if-if there was just like one little area where I—that I think we need—we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we’re just not crazy enough!
I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I’m not too sure I agree with that.|Well, yeah, right, y’know what? Yeah, you’re right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if ……I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y’know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y’know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
What?!|Oh, I know, I know, it’s-it’s so, it’s so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y’know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don’t you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don’t you think?
Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you’re a real special lady, but my divorce isn’t final yet and, and, and we’ve been on four days, so I’m thinking "No, but thanks."|YOU IDIOT!!!!!
Your name, please?|Joey Tribbiani.
Um-hmm, and did you stay up all night in preparation for your sleep study.|Yes he did.
Alll right, we’ll call you in a few minutes.|Hey, check out that girl! She is really hot!
Okay, ready?|Yeah.
Okay.|
Congratulations!|Thank you!
Okay! My turn! My turn!|Okay!  Okay, ready?
Yeah.|Okay.
That was a terrible throw!!|I’m not gonna right to you! That’s not real!
Look at me! My big concern is what’s real?!  Oh my God. We’re really sad, aren’t we?|Yeah, I think we are.
This isn’t even my dress.|Well, at least you didn’t rent yours from a store called, "It’s Not Too Late."
I’m changing out of this.|Me too.
In like a half-hour?|Me too.
Okay, throw it straight this time.|Okay.
I’m getting married next!!|Yay!
I hate my regular clothes now! Y’know? I look down and-and I know that this isn’t gonna be the most special day of my life.|Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn’t you start feeling silly?
Oh my God!|Oh God.
Oh, you’re such a cheater!|Hello! Little ones.
Hey!|So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
Oh, how’d that happen?|Because I’m cooler.
What is that?|Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it’s gonna help me not to snore.
Well, I just called Joshua…|Oh, how did it go?
Well, I did my best to convince him that I’m not some crazy girl who is dying to get married—I’m just going through a hard time.|What did he say?
Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.|Ohh, sweetie!  Hey, I bet you anything that he’s gonna call you again.
Yeah, maybe, but I don’t think I even care. I don’t think he’s the one I’m sad about. Y’know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don’t think I’m handling it all that well.|Yeah, maybe.
And I-I am just trying to figure out why.|Any luck?
Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.|Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.
Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.|Oh, see I-I don’t know if we’re gonna be hungry at three.
Three people. Joshua’s not gonna be there.|What happened?
Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.|Noo. Why?
Well, apparently he scares easy.|Oh, Rachel, I’m-I’m sorry.
It’s okay. Sometimes, things don’t work out the way you’d thought they would.|Come here.
Oh, hey, don’t you have to go pick up Emily?|Yeah.
Yeah.|You okay?
Ugh.|Hey, y’know what might cheer you up?
Y’know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.|Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time.  Maybe someday, there will be.
Oh, okay!|No-no, Rachel, don’t get it! He can’t see us!
I’m not gonna marry Chandler!|Not after this!
Okay, you guys, just relax.|I gotta go.
Y’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.|I know. Ross is getting married.
Phoebe is, making people.|Everybody’s doing stuff!
And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!|We could climb Mt. Everest!
No-no, not something stupid, something huge.|No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
Why not?! I mean it’s just, it’s just climbing! It’s just, it’s just steep!|Yeah!
We’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!|Hey!
Yeah baby!|Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y’know you can die. And, you would die!
Yeah, well…|We could get that Everest video though.
Yeah, we could do that without y’know risking our lives at all!|And while we’re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard!  Oh, y’know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
Oh, well…|So you guys’ll stay here and hang out with me?
Yeeeeahhhh.|Yeah. Yeah.
But I’ll tell you something. One of these days we’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!|Yeah we are!
So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?|Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he’s so cheap, he’d never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
Yeah, they’re fine.|Yeah?
If anyone asks, we’ll just say Ben addressed them.  Oh! So you invited Rachel then?|Sure. Why not?
Really?|Yeah?
I don’t think I’d be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.|Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn’t invite her?
Oh, no-no, y’know I absolutely adore Rachel it’s just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it’s absolutely your decision.  More tea?|Yeah sure.
Earl Grey?|Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!|And I just want a million dollars!
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?|Hi, sure!
You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.|I knew.
You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.|I did.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here—but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?|Yeah, maybe...
See, I see.... big passion in your future.|Really?
I do.|Oh Ross, you're so great. [she playfully rubs his head and gets up]
Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.|Okay.
Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....|Ohhh!!!! [looking at something behind Ross]
Yes, yes, that's right...|Oh, look at the little cat! [a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross] Look at it!
Yes! Did you see that?|You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
I could not have done this without you.|Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine.
You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.|What?
I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.|Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.|Fine.
'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.|Good.
Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I’m doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I’m doing something that I’m actually good at. I mean. if you don’t get that...|No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I’m happy for ya, but I’m tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don’t know what to do anymore.
Well neither do I!|Is this about Mark?
Oh my God.|Okay, it’s not, it’s not.
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you’re, you’re, you’re making this too hard.|Oh I’m, I’m making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
I don’t know, I don’t know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.|Okay, okay, fine, you’re right. Let’s ah, let’s take a break,
Do I know why we’re rushing?|Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?  Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
That’s so great for you guys!|Yeah!
Good luck, with your girlfriend.|Oh, thank you.  Rachel!!!!
Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!|No!!
Just get out! Now!!|No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
What?|Was she good?
Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let’s talk about it!! How was she?|She was...
Awful! Horrible!|She was not good. Not good.
Ewwwww!|Uh-oh.
Good different?|Nobody likes change.
...the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you’ve grown. Y'know?  I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, “Once a cheater, always a cheater.”  Ooh, I just wish we hadn’t lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...|WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
You seem to really like her.|Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y’know no commitment.
Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica’s photo albums, I mean you don’t do that if you’re just in it for two weeks.|You think?
Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you’re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.|Hey, you’re right.
Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can’t believe my brother’s getting married! And in London! It’s so romantic!|Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You’re at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
Hey!|Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross’s wedding?
I never knew that either.|I knew that!  I sooo didn’t know that, but you should see your faces.
We’re hanging out.|What’s this? Is this Ross’s wedding invitation?
I’m sorry honey.|Yeah.
Rach, you’re gonna come though aren’t you?|Oh, honey, I don’t know. I…
You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren’t there. Just say you’ll think about it, okay?|No, I’ll think about it. Yeah.
Who's this from?|Oh, that's Ross's.
Oh...  Oh my God. He remembered.|Remembered what?
It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!|Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
What did you just say?|F-hah.... flennin....
Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.|But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
Oh, that is so sweet. Well you didn't hang up either.|She didn't hang up either...
Rach, I got a message from you.|Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . .
You're over me?|Ohhhhhhhh God.
Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?|Ohh, ohh.
When, when were you... under me?|Well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.
He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.|Really?
I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.|Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn’t say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.|I’m sorry. Was I not supposed to?
Y'know, hey! You’re the one who ended it, remember?|Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
You still love me?|Noo.
What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?|Noo! Maybe! I, I don’t know.
What?!|I just, I feel, I-I just...
Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!|
And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!|I KNEW IT!!!!
Rachel's coming up the path.  Doesn't she look pretty. Jack...|Oh my God.
Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.|Wait, how do you zoom out?  There she is.
Oh, dad, turn it off.|It is off.  Right Ross?
I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.|If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
Y'know what?  I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.|No, no, no.
OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.|C'mon kid, let's go.
Okay dad.|
Nooooo. You’re really not going?|Yeah. It’s just gonna be too hard. Y’know? I mean, it’s Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y’know it’s just, it’s for the best, y’know it is, it’s… Y’know, plus, somebody’s got to stay here with Phoebe! Y’know she’s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
You don’t have a car. And your license expired.|I know.  Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there’s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums!  "It’s almost as good as being there."|It’s better! You can’t go to a museum in your underwear!
Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.|I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.|Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
That’s like the tenth time I’ve peed since I’ve been here!|That’s also like the tenth time you told us.
Yeah, oh I’m sorry, it must be really hard to hear! I tell ya, it’s a lot easier having three babies play Bringing in the Noise, Bringing in da Funk on your bladder! I’m so sick of being pregnant! The only happiness I get is from a cup of coffee, which of course is decaf, ‘cause—Oh! I’m pregnant!|Pheebs, did…you want a cookie?
Thank you so much.|So uh, Pheebs, honey, how are those mood swings coming?
Hey guys!|Hey.
All right, here’s the ring.|Yes! Yes! A thousand times, yes!
So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?|Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don’t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?
I sort’ve already asked Chandler.|What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!
Joey, I figured you’d understand. I mean, I-I’ve known him a lot longer.|Come on Ross! Look, I-I don’t have any brothers; I’ll never get to be a best man!
Wait-wait, so, you get to be my best man twice and I never get to be yours at all?|Oh no-no-no, you—yeah, of course you get to be my best man.
Hey, how can it not be me?!HeyHey!|I’m not even… I’m not even…
Fine, y’know what, that’s it. From now on, Joey, I want you to be my best man.|Yes!  Shame about you man.
Stop it!|What?
One of the babies is kicking.|I thought that was a good thing.
It’s not kicking me, it’s kicking one of the other babies. Oh ! Don’t make me come in there!|Hey!
Hey!! Get your ass back here, Tribbiani!!|Hormones!
This is what I’ve got going for the party so far, liquor wise. Get a lot of liquor.|Great. Great.
Okay, now uh, in terms of the invite list, I’ve got you, me, and Chandler and I’m gonna invite Gunther ‘cause, well, we’ve been talking about this pretty loud.|I’ll be there.
All right—oh! Listen, I know this is your party, but I’d really like to the number of museum geeks that are gonna be there.|Yeah. Tell ya what, let’s not invite any of the anthropologists, only the dinosaur dudes!
Okay! We’ll need a six-pack of Zima.|Hey guys, what are you doing?
You got it.|Okay, see ya later.
Well, there’s gonna be strippers there. He didn’t say anything about no strippers.|He just said, "No strippers."
Look what I got! Look what I got! Look what I got!  Can you believe they make these for little people?|Little village people.
Okay, look at this one. This is my favourite.|Oh, that is so sweet!
I know! Phoebe is gonna love dressing them in these!|Huh. Except, Phoebe’s not gonna be the one that gets to dress them.
Because she’s not gonna get to keep the babies.|Oh my God! We are throwing the most depressing baby shower ever!
Wait a minute! Unless, we give her all gifts she can use after she’s done being pregnant. Like-like umm, regular coffee, Tequila.|Oh, and somebody can get those leather pants she’s always wanted!
What the hell is this?! What, did you actually thought it would make me feel better to give me stuff that I can’t use for another two months?! This sucks! All right, what’s my next present?!|I don’t have anything.
Hey listen man, about the stripper…|Yeah?
Good call!|Okay, a little announcement, a little announcement. I’ve decided that my best man is, my best friend Gunther!
Hey-hey, what are those?|Oh, little party favours, check it out!
Wow! Yeah!|Oh-oh!
Smooth man. Yeah, you got some chilie on your neck.  Thanks Joey.|Oh, hey, don’t forget your shirt.
Oh, thanks!|Okay, hey, museum geeks, party’s over. Okay. Wave bye-bye to the nice lady. There you go. Back to your parent’s basement. All right.  Come on boys, come on out! Here you go. All right.
The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!|What?
The ring is gone!|Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for this—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! You’re the worst best man ever!
Dude, this isn’t funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everything’s cool! I wake up this morning, the stripper’s gone and the ring is gone!|You slept with the stripper?
Hi, guys.|Hi! Phoebe.
I-I wanted to apologise if I—y’know seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Y’know it’s just the hormones, y’know.|No we…
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet.|Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. That’s great. So how-how are things going?
Good. Y’know—no-no, okay, it’s-it feels like everything’s been about me lately, so what’s happening with you?|Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross’s wedding.
Oh!|It just might be too hard, given the history and all that…
Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.|Well, h-how is this like that?
Well, let’s see, it’s not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y’know a bunch of y’know high school crap that nobody really gives y’know…|I’m-I’m sorry, I just thought that…
Ugh! I don’t know what I’m going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they don’t care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isn’t an emergency, then what is?|Hey guys!
Hey…|I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y’know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so…
So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that’s nice!|Yeah, right!
I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those…|That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.
Yeah, the stripper stole it.|My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!
Dude, I screwed up, you don’t have to turn me in!|Not on you! On the stripper!
Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they’re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.|Okay, well, we’ll call the company that sent her!
I did that too! They wouldn’t give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again they’d call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them I’m missing a ring!"|So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there’s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!
Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I…|Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?
Here’s your tea Phoebe.|Oh, thanks.
I’m so glad you liked it.|
What?!|What?! She made the tea!
Oh my God!|Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.
Wait, you can’t have the baby here! I mean I haven’t sterilised it since the guys moved out!|Okay. It’s okay. We’re gonna be okay. Y’know what? It’s okay. I’m gonna, I’m gonna, I’m gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!
Rachel, get the book! The book!|Okay!  Okay! Here!
The Bible?!|I don’t know!
All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she won’t recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I.  You be Mr. Gonzalez, and I’ll be uh, Mr. Wong.|Diverse.
There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!|Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?
I still don’t get how you know when it’s false labour.|Well, do you see any babies?
Well, isn’t that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.|I know. It’s just y’know usually when you’re, when you’re done with the pregnant thing, y’know, then you get to do the mom thing. I’m gonna be y’know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.
No, really. Really, Pheebs, you’re not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when they’re bad, y’know, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just won’t calm down. Y’know?|I mean, you’re the one they’re gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.
And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!|Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!
And y’know what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.|They are gonna love me.
Oh!|Thanks you guys! Again.
What?!|Oh my God!
If anything should happen to him…|Joey! The vet said it’s a simple procedure.
So! Things can go wrong! You don’t know! What if he doesn’t make it?!|He will, Joe.
I’m so worried about him, y’know?|Somebody lose a ring?
H-h-h-how’s the duck?|He’s doing just fine, he’s resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.
Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.|No, that’s all right.
No, it’s not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!|Hey, come on, it’s not your fault.
Yeah, it is! You wouldn’t have lost the ring, right? Y’know what, Ross you were right from the start, he  should be your best man.|No, you should.
Now, don’t argue with me…|Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.
Really?|Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are my… I mean, I’m lucky to have just one good…
|What a baby.
Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!|Six-hour trip to London. That’s a lot of Monica.
Passport, check!  Camera, check! Traveller’s cheques, check!|Who are you saying "check" too?
Myself. Y’know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check!  My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.|Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
Hey!|Hey! Are you ready yet?
Yep! You got the tickets?|Oh! Got ‘em right here,  check!
It’s all London, baby! Here we go.|You got your passport?
Ohh!!|There it is.
Okay, if you need the vacuum, it’s in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator…|Okay, okay, but Rachel’s gonna be here too, can’t I just ask her this stuff?
Yeah, okay, give that a try!|All right! Let’s do it!
All right, y’know what? We really are late! Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!!|Fine. You’ll-you’ll watch it on video when we get back.
Come on! Do something!|I am, I’m ignoring you.
Okay, here!|Oh, what the hell is that?
It’s London, baby! All right, the hotel’s here.|Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
I got it!  Here we go.|Okay. Listen-listen, we’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
…and that was all before 10 o’clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren’t any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We’re not gonna be…|Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily,  honey, okay?
Well, up yours too!|What?! No! No! That’s-that’s time-out!
Sorry.|Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything’s gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
I still can’t believe they’re tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you’ll ever see. I mean it’s over…  Oh my God!|It’s nice.
Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?|It’s all right! Everything’s gonna be all right.
How’s it gonna be all right?!|Uh-huh, I see that.
All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I’ve ever seen. Hey!  Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?|I think it’s great. It’s great. Y’know, they’re thinking of changing the name of this place.
Really? To what?|To Put the Camera Away!!!
Oh. Oh.|Oh, honey! Don’t get up! What do you need?
Oh, no. Oh, nothing.|Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
Okay, I have a wedgie.|Okay, that is all you.
So-so, what do you want for lunch?|Oh, I don’t know. I guess we have to eat.
Yeah, I do. What’s the matter?|I’m just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn’t have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
Eh, don’t be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married…|Still in love with?!
Yeah!|I’m not in love with Ross!
Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.|Phoebe, I’m going to Ross’s wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I’m still in love with him! I mean, hey, y’know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y’know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don’t mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn’t mean that-that I’m still in love with him. Y’know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him—Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my—why didn’t you tell me?!!
We thought you knew!|We?!
Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!|You all know? Does Ross know?
Oh no, Ross doesn’t know anything.|Oh, I can not believe you didn’t tell me!
Hey!|So, what are you guys in the market for? We’ve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
Check this out? Huh?  Yeah. That’s the stuff. What do you think?|Well, I don’t have to buy that, "I’m with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
Well, I like it. Here you go.|All right, look, you’re not really gonna buy that are you? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?
Oh, I embarrass you?|How can I answer that when I’m pretending I don’t know you?
Oh yeah?  If you’re gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.|Good choice.
Thanks.|Okay, wait. All right, that’s it, okay, I’m out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
Hello?|Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we’ll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
We don’t have to.|Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.|She said what?
She said, "If I’m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."|Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister’s teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?  This isn’t right.
I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I’m sure they’ll come back when we can do it right.|I can’t ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
Don’t you point your pants at me!  We have no choice! Anywhere that’s half-decent would’ve be booked months ago, Ross don’t you understand? This is our wedding I’m talking about.|The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we’re getting married.
So what are you saying? It’s now or never?|No. I’m saying it’s now.
Or?|There’s no ‘or’ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
It’s not the pants. It’s you that is backwards. And if, and if you don’t understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn’t get married at all!|
Hey!|Hi.
So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?|Manhattan does not have enough stores.
Well, I think I can help you get over him.|You can?
Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.|Um-hmm.
And a small piece of chocolate.|Okay.
And a glass of tepid water.|Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn’t feel like getting up. Okay, I’m gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you’re going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.|I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he’s such a great guy. Here.  Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you’re with Ross okay and imagine that you’re kissing him. And you’re-you’re running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it’s some kind of grease, it’s—uck! Hah?|I don’t know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y’know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let’s try some uh, aversion therapy.|Okay.
Okay?|All right.
So uh, now look at the picture…|Okay.
All right, and umm…|Ow!
Okay, how do you feel now?|Well, I like you less!
Hey.|Hey.
Oh.  Sorry!|No-no-no, y’know what? I really shouldn’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I’ve had a really lousy day.
Me too.|Yeah?
Noo!! I’ve had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!|Hey!
Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.|Okay, so umm, what’s your friend’s name?
Oh, Chandler.|Hi Chandler!
That’s Fergie baby!!|Joey says you don’t really like his hat, but I think it’s kinda dashing.
Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I’m in my map and-and… Hey!|Hey!
Wait up!|Hey-hey, since you’re the ‘fix-it’ lady, here’s a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn’t want to have the wedding at all?
Yeah.  Hey, I hope Ross didn’t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!|I hope he did!
Hello.|Hey, Pheebs! It’s Joey!
Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the—that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say ‘hi!’ but then I figured, he doesn’t care if he looks like you.|That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
Ohh, they’re having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn’t been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?|Kinda, but I’ve just been having way too much fun.
So you’re not homesick yet?|No, I don’t think so.
All right, the seven of us miss you.|Who’s seven?
Y’know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies…|Ahh, the babies miss me?
Ooh, the pizza guy’s here!|What? You ordered pizza without me?!
Yeah. But y’know we were thinking about you, y’know we ordered the Joey Special.|Two pizzas?!
Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.|Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!|You’ll see.
Oh God.|Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y’know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles…
It’s perfect.|And, I don’t know, if it starts to rain…
Well then we’ll get wet.|Ohh. And I don’t even have a date.
Pheebs?|Yeah?
Do you remember where the duck food is?|Yeah, it’s in the guys’ apartment under the sink. Why?
Because I’m going to London.|What?! What do you mean you’re going to London?
Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don’t have those babies until I get back.|I—Rachel, you can’t go! Ross loves Emily!
Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.|That’s not why you’re going! You’re going because you hope he’s gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
Ohh—Do you think he will?!|No! Because he’s in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you’re just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y’know, it’s too late! You missed you’re chance! I’m sorry, I know this must be really hard, it’s over.
Y’know what? No. It’s not over until someone says, "I do."|I do! I do! I do!  Ugh, like I can really chase you. I’m carrying a litter.
The Waltham Residence.|Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily’s Parents’ house.
This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.|This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it’s not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it’s not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.|No no no, I’ll be nice, I swear!!!   Could you just give me the number for where they are?
I’m afraid, I’m not at liberty to divulge that information.|Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don’t give me that number then I’m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
Hangs up.|Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
Hey.|Hi. Mom. Dad.
Sir?|What’s in it?
Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.|Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can’t even remember what Phoebe looks like.
What the hell!!!|what’s up, Dad?
This bill for my half of the wedding. it’s insane.|How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
I’m going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.|Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.|Ooh, Jack....
Hi.|Hello.
Hello. Umm, when is your next flight to London?|There’s one leaving in thirty minutes.
Ohh, good.|And I do have one seat left.
Ohh, thank you, thank you, thank you.|The last minute fare on this ticket is twenty seven hundred dollars.
Ohh, I just don’t think I have enough left on my credit card.|Well you can split it with another credit card.
Ohh, okay, how about five.  Ohh, thank you.|I’m just going to need to see your passport.
|
Look, face it, my father is not going to pay for the build-in barbecue and believe me you can kiss you gazebo goodbye. Now I might be able to get you the new lawn.|Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
I go back there with lawn ornaments, he’s going to laugh in my face.|This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement.  Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
Hi, Pheebs.|Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don’t want to talk about it, that’s fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
Bye, Pheebs.|God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
I’d like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will.|Hello, Waltham Interiors.
|Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I’m not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys.  Could we please..go home now?
I was laughing.|Out loud?
Well I didn’t want everyone to think I was stupid.|So how are you doing?
My mother’s driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I’m happy.  I’m not going to let anything spoil that.|I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
Well, thanks, we like him.|My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
Then why would he say it?|Because he’s crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
Oh, my mother’s right. I’m never going to get married.|Ahh, you know what? That is....Who wouldn’t want you?
Hi, I’m back. Listen, I need to...|Hello.
Hello. I need to get on the 11 o'clock flight.|Oh I’m afraid that plane has already pulled away from the gate.
Okay, you know what/ You’re going to have to call that plane and tell them to swing around and come and pick me up.|I can’t do that.
Sure, you know what? Come on, we’ll just tell them that there was like a problem with like the "engine".|I’m afraid I’m going to have to ask you to step aside, Miss.
Look, If I don’t get to London!! He is going to marry that other girl!!!|I can’t imagine why.
I’m getting married today!! Whoo-hoo!!|Morning, Ross.
I’m getting married, to..day!!|Yeah you are!!
Ahh, whoo-hoo!!(He runs back out the door.|
Well I’ve-I’ve never done that with you before.|
So, ahh, how are ya? How ya...How ya... You okay?|Yep, yep...You?
Yes...Yes..Uh-huh, You? We did you.|Well...I’d better get going.
Oh yea yea, absolutely.|Could you not look?
Ohhh.|Ahh, ahh, excuse me.
Yeah?|If you’re planning on doing that throughout the entire flight. Please tell me now. So that I could that a sedative...or perhaps slip you one.
Hello?|Hey, were the hell have you been?!
Hey. I spent the night out. I met this cute bridesmaid. She is so...|I don’t want to hear about her!!
Ahh Pheebs, you know you’re still my number one girl.|No! No, we have an emergency. Okay? Rachel’s coming to London.
Ohh great!!!|No it’s not great. No, she’s coming to tell Ross that she loves him.
But, he loves Emily?|I KNOW THAT!!! You have to stop her!! She’s going to ruin the wedding!!
Okay.|All right, so, okay...
Hold on. Hold on.  Rachel coming. Do...Something.|Okay, so I’m done my part, okay. It’s your responsibility now, okay. The burden is off me, right?
Right!|So tell me about this girl?
Hey.|Hey.
Have you seen Monica?|I’m not seeing Monica.
What?|What?
Look we’ve got to find her. Phoebe just called!! Rachel’s coming to tell Ross she loves him!!|Oh my god!
I know! That’s why we got to find Monica!! You know where she is?|No!! Okay!! What’s with the third degree?! Why don’t you just shine a light in my eyes?!
...And so then I realized. All this stuff I had been doing. proposing to Joshua, lying to Ross about why I couldn’t come to the wedding. Was all just a way of...|Oh, oh oh!! I’m sorry, can I interrupt? You know I just want to say..That you are a horrible, horrible person.
Ehh, pardon me?|You say you love this man, yet you’re about to ruin the happiest day of his life. I’m afraid I have to agree with you friend Pheebs.. This is a..this is a...terrible, terrible plan.
But he has to know how I feel!|But why? He loves this...this Emily person. No good can come of this.
Well I-I think your wrong.|Oh-no.
Oh my God! It’s like a fairyland.|I know, it’s horrible isn’t it?
I just hope...|
Hello Joey.|Hey, Felicity.
Umm, I thought about you all day.|Yeah.
Um-hum. Talk New York to me again.|How you doin?
Mmm.|Oh, yeah.
Hello, Waltham Interiors.|Mrs. Waltham. Hi. It’s Phoebe again.
Why?!|Yea. Can I please, please, please talk to one of the best men? This is going to be the last time I promise.
Joey there’s a girl on the phone for you.|
Friends. Family. We are gathered to celebrate here today the joyous union of Ross and Emily.  Now Ross, repeat after me. I Ross...|I Ross...
Take thee, Emily...|Take thee, Rachel... Emily.
Uhh...Shall I go on?|He-he said Rachel, right? Do you think I should go up there?
I think we’d better start again. Ross, repeat after me. I, Ross…|I, Ross…
Take thee, EM-I-LY…|Take thee,
As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, till death parts us.|As my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, until death parts us. Really, I do. Emily.
May I have the rings?  Ross, place this ring in Emily’s hand as a symbol of the love that encircles you forever.|Happy too.
Ross and Emily have made their declarations and it gives me great pleasure to declare them husband and wife.|Yay!
You may kiss the bride.|This is worse than when he married the lesbian.
You’ve spoiled everything! It’s like a nightmare! My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!|Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?
I hate you!!|And, I love you!!
Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.|Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
Oh, hello Rachel.|Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!  Okay, don’t believe me, I know I’m right—do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.|Yes, I want to change. And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?
Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes.|Fifteen minutes.
Oh, yay…|Great…
Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in my room?|But my clothes are—ohh!
Wow, you look…|No time for that!
Well, I’ve got a girl in here.|No you don’t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!|Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
Well, I suppose I’d have to say you!! But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?|Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It’s My Giant!
You really think this is okay?|Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it.
Oh, it’s so beautiful. Ohh! Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this.|Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
Okay!|Okay!
You didn’t find her?|No, I’ve looked everywhere!
Yeah, I think you should keep looking!|Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
Or 45.|Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
Well, it’s getting late.|Yeah, we’re gonna go.
Ugh, y’know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.|Yeah, it’s a very large plane.
We have to leave for New York in an hour.|I know, I’ve been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don’t you think?
We can’t do that that’s insane. I mean ‘A’ he could wake up and ‘B’ y’know, let’s go for it.|Em-Emily?
Y’know, maybe it’s best that we never got to do it again.|Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special.  Y’know, technically we still are over international waters.
I’m gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I’ll see you there in a bit?|‘Kay!
I know!|Had the beef-tips, huh?
Hey!|Hey!
|No we didn’t!
I know you didn’t, I was talking about Monica.|Phoebe, I did not have sex.
This pregnancy is throwing me all off.|All right, I’m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
Oh, me too!|Why would you need to say hi to them, you’ve been feeding them for four days?
Oh right, maybe I’ll just go home.|Well, we certainly are alone.
Rach! Rach!|Hi!
Hi! What are you, what are you doing here?|Well, I-I-I’ve been on Standby for a flight home for hours.
Oh.|Ohh, so no sign of Emily huh?
Not yet.|So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
Pretty soon I guess.|Yeah. I’m sorry.
I just, I don’t understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y’know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she’d actually show up?|No, you’re not an idiot, Ross. You’re a guy very much in love.
Same difference.|All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
I get it! Well, that’s that.|No, you know what, I think you should go.
What?|Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it’d be really good.
Oh, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t know…|Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
I could, yeah, I can do that.|Yeah.
I can’t, I can’t even believe her! No, y’know what, I am, I am gonna go!|Good!
I know, why not?|Right!
Right?|Right!
Y’know—thanks!|Okay, I’ll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
Yeah, well…nah.|What? Wait, what?
Why don’t you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?|Well-well, I don’t know Ross—really?
Yeah, yeah, it’ll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?|Uh-huh.
No really, I mean, I mean, God, I could use a friend.|Oh wow, uh okay, uh maybe. Umm, yes, I can do that!
Okay!|Okay!
Cool!|All right!
Come on!  Here.|Oh, okay, we’re going. Yeah.
Ah! Ah! I forgot my jacket!|Oh, wait-wait-wait…
You tell them to wait!|Okay. Wait! Wait!
You look cute in bubbles.|Ehh, you're just liquored up.
Chicken? I could eat some chicken.|Hey Joe!
Hey!|Hey, Pheebs!
I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver…|
What?|Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway…|Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?
Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat—I don't want to talk about it.|Hey!
So you still hadn't heard from Emily?|No, not since I lost her at the airport.
London is stupid! Stupid!|Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
Oh… No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.|I'll do it!
Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.|Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't—I still can't believe it.
Honey, sweetie, by the edges.|I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it …
Ohh.|…I mean it's my fault.
Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!|Oh my God!
Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.|I bet it was about her a little.
If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther!  I mean, he's nice, he's cute.|Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda…
Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.|Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.|All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.
We got out pictures back from London.  Here's all of us at the Tower of London.|
What happened?|Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!|Well…
What took you so long?|I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
Oh, good.|So, thanks for having me over! Rach.
Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.|That's not European!
Oh God, I really had a good time!|Yeah, me too.  So, I guess this is it.
Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?|Yeah!
Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.|Okay, yeah!
Umm, hi!|Hi.
Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.|She's doing her laundry.
What's that?|It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
Oh, honey that's awful.|Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
But, it's not raining.|I can't catch a break!
Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right?  Hey, Dave!|Yeah?
Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye!  Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.|Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
Yeah.|What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
Ohh! You did not drop any socks!|I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted…tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.|What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!|I make the decisions, and I say no.
Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.|You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
Well…|Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?|No.
I really need to talk to you.|Well, then talk!
Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?|Yes!
Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might  end up hurting.|Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily.  My God, think of the massacre.
All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.|But I…
Please!|All right, fine.
Joey, I'm in!|All right. Good deal.
Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!|Uh, okay, Pheebs?
Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!|Phoebe!
Wait! It was my plan.|Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
And, I came up with Atlantic City.|Which, is the new plan!
The paper.|Yeah, what's it about?
Events from around the globe.|Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized…|Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
Yeah.|Okay.
Go ahead.|Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh,  I'm still in love with you Ross.
What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.|I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
Why are you laughing?|Because  was like, "You are such an idiot!"
Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.|I'm sorry, that's not funny.
Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is.  "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!|Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is…|The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
That is what the thing is.|Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.|That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
Okay, let's go!|Atlantic City!
Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.|High-five, the babies are coming!
I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!|I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
Do you know anything about women?|No.
That's all right.|Okay.
Hi.|Hi.
Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.|Okay. Have you started having contractions?
Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?|Well…
Oh my God!|It's all right.
Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.|Okay…
Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!|Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
-Joey, what are you doing?!|I gotta get the before shot!
Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.|What?!
Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.|Yeah, he's head of the department.
Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.|Oh my!
They're male nurses.|Not in my head.
Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?|Umm.  Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.|Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
What?|Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.|Yep! There's always room for Jell-O…
Joey, how do you make that dirty?|Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh,  Grandma's chicken salad…
|Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either—Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh!  Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.|Really? Male nurses?
Yeah, I was bummed too.|So they're going on dates? When?
I think Saturday—.|What's with him?
Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!|Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.|Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
Fine! Maybe I will too!|
Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.|Hi! And you're going into what grade?
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.|Umm, well, what else could it be?
It's kidney stones.|Or?
All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.|They are. Why?
They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.|Happy birthday!
Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.|Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!|Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!|Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.|Oh, just ask him!
Me?!|I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!|You're right.
Feeling a little better sweetie?|Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
Me too.|Hey! I just heard. What's up?
So did you ask him?|No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.|Oh Fonzie.
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.|Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
Hi!|How are you doing?
Okay, doctor says any minute now.|Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.|Hey!
Ohh, get these things out of me!|Breathe! Breathe! Breathe throw the pain.
I want the drugs Ross, I want the drugs!|I do too! I do too!
Argh!|Argh!
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi!|Hi!
That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!|Oh, honey, don’t worry. She's gonna make it on time.
Yeah.|Yeah. So Frank, three babies. Whew, that just seems like a lot, huh?
Not to me.|Yeah, fair enough.
Okay, you're at ten centimeters. Time to start having some babies. All right, I want only the father in here please.|Bye Dan!
All right, I need a clamp, sterile towel, and channel 31.|What is that?
Okay, now push! That's it push! Just concentrate on pushing! Yeah, here we go!|I see the head.
All right. Keep pushing! Come on!|I can't believe there's somebody coming out of you right now. There's somebody coming out of you! Is it? Is it? It's my son.
YESSSSS!!!!! We got a baby boy!!|Yes!
Frank Jr. Jr.!!|Oh, how does he look? How does he look?
Okay. You ready to push again?|I already had a baby. Leave me alone.
Come on little Chandler, it's time to be born. Come on little Chandler! Come on!|All right, he's coming. He's coming!
Chandler's a girl!|Oh God, kindergarten flashback.
They musta read the sonogram wrong. 'Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!|Okay, keep saying it!
No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes.|We have our babies?
Yeah.|Oh, we have our babies.
Oh my God.|You did it, man.
So, I'll call you tomorrow.|Great!
I think you're my favorite.|Which one do you have?
I don't care.|Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!|I know.
Come in. I've been waiting for you.|Hi! I just wanna- Oh my God!
Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.|Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work.  I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!|That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
Uh-huh, that one!|Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail.
It's just Joey and Ross.|Why aren't you guys at the movie?
But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?|Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
Hey!|Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.|Vomit tux? Who vomited on—y'know what, what you up to Joe?
Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!|Oh that's great!
A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!|Ugh, PBS!
Why don’t you like PBS, Pheebs?|Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.|This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!|What-what are you talking about?!
Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?|Yeah. So?
It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.|Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
Well, may I ask for one example?|Yeah, it's… Y'know there's—no you may not!
That's because all people are selfish.|Are you calling me selfish?!
Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?|I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
That he doesn't exist.|Right.
So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?|Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?|Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don’t think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
I don’t care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!|Really?! That's what you heard?  You said that?
What-what-what are you gonna do?|I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!|This will be your phone.
That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.|No you answer it and take pledges.
But I'm the host!|No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.|Well, here's your phone doctor.
I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!|Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!|Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.|I understand that would be difficult.
Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?|I don't know, it's just…
Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.|All right.
All right, did you just say all right?|I did. Now I'm the idiot.
Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!|Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
Yes, tell me.|Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
I know. I am, I am so sorry.|And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
Again, very sorry.|I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.|All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
Oh that is so great! That's…|As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.|Yes!
No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.|Why?
I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision?  I'm actually asking you!|Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
Thanks for the help, problem solved.|Hello.
Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs…|How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
PBS telethon.|Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?|Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.|
Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?|Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
Come on man! You've been here all day!|Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
|A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do.  Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!|All right, let me see.  Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
PBS Telethon.|Hi Joey.
Hey Pheebs!|I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
$200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?|Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
And you don't a little good about donating the money?|No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.|Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.|Keep talking.
I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH…MY…GOD.|Really?
Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!|Well, if we owe it?  Oh my… When is Joey gonna be home?
Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him.  Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.|But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.|Yeah.
All right, let's show them how it's done.|Okay.
Y'know that wasn't part of it?|I know!
Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!|For what?
For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.|Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!|It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
Like what?|Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.|No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to… Hi!|Thanks.
Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it.  Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!|
Never done that before.|Nope.
Hi!|
Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.|I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.|I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.|Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!|Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.|Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.|I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
Hey.|Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
No, she's out shopping.|Damn!
Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?|I have no idea. I mean… But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
Can you hear anything?|Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
Ooh, Madlibs, mine!|Condoms?
Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily…|Oh my God! My dog died!
What?!|Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
Le Poo's still alive?!|Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine- Oh my God.
I can't believe it! We're here!|Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.|Come here.  Okay, be right back.
Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!|We're switching rooms.
Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!|No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.  Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?|Oh yeah!
Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing… Okay, -Oh hey!|What?
You're nose is bleeding!|Oh God.  Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
Umm…|Sorry. Sorry.
Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.|Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
I think you'll find this room more to your liking.|Okay, great.
They say he's only got half a tank left.|Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.|Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
Okay, this one I like!|Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?|Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!|Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!|Do not speak ill of the dead.
We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?|I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
What did you say?|I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
Hi!|Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
Okay, what's up?|Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.|And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants…
Yeah?|…is for me not to see you anymore.
That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her?  Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?|It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!|You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.|What are you doing?
Storming out!|Rachel, this is your apartment.
Damn Rollos!|Hey, you're back!
Hey.|How was your conference?
It was terrible. I fought with|Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.|Hi!
Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.|Chandler!
Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.|Okay, fine, $300.
300 dollars?!|Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
Urghh!!|What are you guys woofing about?
Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!|Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.|You want my advice?
Yes! Please!|You're not gonna like it.
That's okay.|You got married to fast.
That's not advice!|I told ya.
I'm going to the bathroom.|Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
Hey!|Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
Yes that was mine.|'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
Yes that would have made more sense.|Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya.  Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
Phoebe?  You gotta come with me!|Come where?
Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.|Okay, but try and get Joey too.
Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?|I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
Oh, Ross…|No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.|Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!|I can't believe this is happening.
I know.|I am so sorry.
I know that too.|Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
Hey!|Hi.
I just came over to drop off…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?|Yeah, it did.
So, I guess this is over.|What?
Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.|Why, exactly?
Because of the weekend, we had a fight.|Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than—Ohhh!
So, this isn't over?|You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
Really? Okay. Great!|Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
We're in a relationship?|I'm afraid so.
Hey!|Hey!
Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.|Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!|Yes. Yes.
And-and you?!|Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!|It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!|The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!|No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but…|I know, it's great!
The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"|Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
Count for what?|Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!|What?!
Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.|Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman!  And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.|Okay.
I can hear that!|Rachel's at work.
Hey!|Hey!
Eeeee-|Argh-argh!!  Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!|Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.  That didn't happen, I made that up!
Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.|What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.|Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence…
Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?|Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
I want the little round waffles.|All right.  Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
Arghhhh!!!!!!|Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.|I'll take it!
That might work!|Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?
Why?|Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
Yeah?|Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
Okay.|Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
Yesss?|Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
O-kay!|Wow! That guy is so rude!
Hey!|Hey!
So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?|Crematorium Chris? Sure!
He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.|Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
|Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.|So, rocks.
I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.|Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing  and it kinda knocked me out a little?
I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.|Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice…|You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
Why?|It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
What's going on?|We all hate Emily!
Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!|I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
God, I feel so guilty about Ross.|Oh, I know.
Hi!|So you like the short hair better.
What? Yeti—I mean Danny?|I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so…. Y'know.|Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
What?|That's cool. Cool.
What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!|Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!|Do you?
Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.|Okay.
And stop saying that! I hate that!|Okay!
Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?|The pizza-place across the street any good?
What?!|I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
Okay. Okay.|Stop saying that. I hate that.
Uh, Ross?|Are you still mad at us?
Yeah, we are so sorry.|
Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.|You do, huh?
Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air.  Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone…|What are you talking about?
I'm not sure.|Hi!
RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!|Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!|I haven't seen him in so long!
Hey!  Hold on.|Hi Emily!
Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!|She's there?!
Yeah, yeah, she's here.|Ross, take me off speakerphone.
Hi.|How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?|You obviously can't keep away from her.
Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.|I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.|You're right.
So, can you trust me?|No.
I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.|How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.|Well, I guess that's it.
What happened? What happened?|My marriage is over.
Are you looking at naked tribe's women?|No, look.
That's a pig.|I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
Hey!|Emily's cousin kicked me out!
What?!|Why?
How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?|Who needs a lease when it's family!
Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!|Yeah.
Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.|Oh, Larry.
Thanks.|Thank you.  Mon?
Hmm?|How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try…|Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.|Two pounds of Moca Java please.
Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?|I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
Ohh, fun!|Ohh, great!
Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.|Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
And you're not gonna do that.|That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
So-so there is no party.|No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.|Exactly.
Ross?|Hey roomies!
Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't—I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.|Oh yeah!
Hey, all right!|Pretty cool, huh?
You're fake laughing too, right?|Oh, the tears are real.
You look beautiful this evening.|Show me the badge again.
Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies  have been.|You are just nonstop!
We're outta here!|Why?!
Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!|You have the power to do that?
This does.|Shut it down.
Hey.|What are you doing?
Nothing.|You built a fort didn't ya?
Kinda.|
Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.|I hate this thing!
Oh, hi Danny.|Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.|You are?
Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.|Yeah, what's the gala for?
It's a uh, regatta gala.|Really! You-you sail?
No-no, but I support it.|Okay,  hope I see you tomorrow night.
Okay.  Walked right into that one didn't he?|What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.|Great. So the ball is in his court?
|Sorry.
Hey!|Hey!
You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!|Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!|I don't know, clean places?
Umm, yum!|It's Danny.
Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?|I'll take sports.
Not even on page 7?|two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
What about that circled one?|Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
Yes, it is.|Hey, let's go look at it!
There we go!|Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
Let's go quicker.|Yeah!
Oh my God!|Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.|But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?|Oh, it's perfect!
How about you?|It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.|We are bad people.
Hey, ready for dinner?|Ooh, absolutely!
Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?|Ooh, I love that place!  So, no.
How about Mama Lisettie's?|Enh. Sure!
has been setting out.|Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That—this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know.  Okay, let's go!
Hey, buddy!  Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?|But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!|Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.|Thank you.  Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!|Yes that was a nice place!
Yeah!|Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
I don't know. Maybe pizza?|About Ross!
Hello!  Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.|Hello?
Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!|Just go over and say hi.
No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.|Hey, Danny!
Hey! Oh right, tonight was your party.|Oh wow, you look great! Glad you could make it.
Oh well, y'know, the gala had to end sometime.|Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back.
Yeah, sure.  All right, whose court is the ball in now?|I thought there wasn't a ball?
Oh, come on! He's glad that I came, he doesn't want me to go anywhere, balls flying all over the place!|This is the girl I told you about.
Oh, go on! You telling people about me?|You two could really hit it off! I'm gonna go mingle.
Yeah, okay, at ease solider!|I'm sorry?
No, it's all right, you can just drop the act Tommy. I know what's going on here. Your Danny's wingman right? You guys are best buds. Frat bros!|I'm gonna go talk to uh, a friend.
Man! He just keeps lobbing them up and I just keep knocking them right out of the park!|I think I need a drink.
98. 99. 100. Okay, go!|
Here we go! Here we go!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey. So I uh, I didn't get that apartment. Some problem with my application.
You're kidding, no!|Yeah. But, the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while. So…
Yeah!|Are you guys sure about this?
Yes! Ross, you have to stay!|All right.
All right, buddy!|So I'm a pimp huh? It's okay! Look, I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass, but you just have to talk to me. Tell me if something is bothering you. Okay? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just .
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?|Come on, it's fun!
All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?|Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.|I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.|Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?|Are you aware that you're still talking?
Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!|It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.|More turkey Mr. Chandler?
You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.|I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
In this life, Phoebe.|Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
Hello?|Hello?
Phoebe?|Joey? What's going on?
Look.|Oh my God!
I know! It's stuck!!!|Easy. Step. How did it get on?
I put it on to scare Chandler!|Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.|Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
It's Joey.|What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
I can't! It-it's stuck!|Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
Sorry! Sorry.|Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!|I'm over here big guy.
You did look like an idiot.|Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.|Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
Monica! I think Rachel's here!|I'll get it!  Happy Thanksgiving!
You too sweethart!|Hey!
I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.|Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.|Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?|Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
Okay!|Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
Oh that's so great!|I know!
Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.|Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!|I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
So I’m thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.|Emotional Knapsack?
Yeah.|Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I’m gonna be out with her all night.|Dude, don't do that too me!
All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.|No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
Hey!|Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!|Well, I do.
I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!|Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.|Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!|Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.|Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
Jack.|What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
I'll get it.|No, God! Please, let me!
She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.|Hi, Chandler.
Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.|Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
What do we got here?|Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.|Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
Did you bring the toe?|Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
|What?! What is it?
You brought a carrot.|What?
This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.|You brought a carrot?!
It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.|Without my toe?! I need my toe!
That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!|I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!|I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.|Chandler!
I can't believe this.|Chandler, I said I was sorry.
Yeah, well, sorry doesn’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.|Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
Nice try.|Wait, wait, wait!
Look, Monica…|Look!
This is not going to work.|I bet this will work!
You are so great! I love you!|What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!|You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!|Yes, you did!
Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here!  This is getting ridiculous uh!|Eric Aasen
What am I sitting on?|Top of the world? Dock of the bay?  I'm out.
Ew-eww!! Undies!|All right! Who's are they? Who's are they?
That's it! I'm tired of covering for you two! This has got to stop!  And tighty-whiteys! What are you, 8?|Thank you Joey, thank you so much!
Oh hey, no, you're not welcome. Okay, look, I hate this! You guys keep embarrassing me!|Wow! And around the ankles, y'know that is a tough spot.
Yeah, it was! All right, listen, I can't…|All this lying has been hard on us too.
Oh-oh, yeah-yeah, I bet all the sex makes it easier!|Well, yeah actually.
All right! But,  you do it with me once.|Joey!
Hey, Phoebe!|Hi, Pheebs!
Okay, look, I-I have enough stuff for one more sandwich, I mean I was going to eat it myself, but|That-that would be incredible. Thank you so much. I-I still can't believe someone ate it!! I mean, look, I left a note and everything.
Phoebe, you are a bad ass!|Someday I'll, tell you about the time I stabbed the cop.
Phoebe?|Well, he stabbed me first!!
Sorry I'm late, but I left late.|Okay.
So Pheebs, what is the book about?|I thought you said you read it in high school.
Well yeah, but then I remembered I started it and there was this pep rally and I was, I was on top of the pyramid but anyway—umm, what is this book about?|Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England. Which I think represents the wildness of Heathcliff's character. I totally get symbolism.
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.|Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which I think is-is mirrored in the wildness of Heathcliff's character.|Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here…
Well, honey that was pretty obvious.|Well how would you know?! You didn't even read it!
Yeah but why didn't you just say that you didn't read the book?!|Be-because I didn't want him to think I was stupid! I mean, that was really embarrassing what happened to you!
Yeah?|Phoebe! You're note, amazing! Not only did no one touch my sandwich, but people at work are actually afraid of me. Yeah, a guy called me mental! Mental Geller, yeah, I always wanted a cool nickname like that.
God, this was really fun! I've been wondering if you were going to ask me out.|So you uh, still wondering?
No, we just went out.|You're smart. I like that.
Oh, candles!|Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!
I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date!|Hiya.
You guys promised you'd be more careful! I mean, come on! The good Joey name is being dragged through the mud here!|We're so sorry.
Well, I'm telling everyone about you! That's the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that doesn't make me look like a pig!|No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.
Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?|Oh—I don't know.
Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!|Okay, just wait, please. I promise we'll come up with something. Just give us a little more time.
Umm, Ross. May I have a word with you?|Yeah, of course, Donald.
We've been getting reports of some very angry behavior on your part.|What?!
Threatening letters, refusal to meet deadlines, apparently people now call you mental.|Yeah.
We want you to speak to a psychiatrist.|Oh no, you-you don't understand. Ugh, this is so silly. Umm, this is all because of a sandwich.
A sandwich?|Yeah. You see my-my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches. Her secret is, she puts a, an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle; I call it the Moist Maker. Anyway, I-I put my sandwich in the fridge over here…
Oh, you know what?|What?
I-I'm sorry. I, I-I-I believe I ate that.|You ate my sandwich?
It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.|Oh-oh really? Did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a Moist Maker?
No.|Do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it?
There may have been a-a joke or a limerick of some kind.|That said it was my sandwich?!
Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.|What?
Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.|You-you-you-you  threw my sandwich away!
Hi!|Hi!
So umm, what's this book about?|You didn't read this one either?!
Well, I was gonna, but I accidentally read something else.|What?
Vogue! Hey, so tell me about this Jane Eyre woman.|No! You should've read it yourself!
Come on Phoebe! Don’t be such a goodie-goodie!|Fine! Okay, all right, so Jane Eyre, first of all, you'd think she's a woman, but she's not. She's a cyborg.
A cyborg?! Isn't that like a robot?!|Yeah, this book was light years ahead of its time.
Uh, thank you Phoebe. Umm, well, what struck me most when reading Jane Eyre was uh, how the book was so ahead of its time.|If you're talking about feminism, I think you're right.
Hey.|Hey. Okay, so umm, since that video camera thing didn't work out uh, I thought that I would give you just a little preview.
You're naked in this picture!|I know.
Ross?|Monica!
Which I may say, right now, is out of control.|He gave me a pill for it.
And you're okay with that?|I don't know. It's going to be weird not having a job for a while, but I, I definitely don't care about my sandwich.
Ugh, that was so embarrassing! I can't believe you let me go on and on like that!|I'm sorry. It was just so funny when you started comparing Jane Eyre to Robocop.
That was not funny!|Well, I snapped! Okay? You weren't taking the class seriously.
Phoebe, come on! What is the big deal? I thought this was going to be something we could do together! Y'know, I thought it would be fun!|Well, yeah! Fun is good, but y'know I also wanted to learn. Y'know, people are always talking about what they learned in high school and I never went to high school.
I know! I know! I know!|Monica, you asked the question.
Oh my God! That's Monica!!|Oh no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
You get away from me!! You sick, sick, sick, sick-o!!|What's going on?
Joey has got a secret peephole!|
Look!|
Well, what is the truth?|Yeah, what's going on?
Monica, is this true?|Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?
Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?|Ahh—oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?
And the video camera?|Uhh, Monica?
I really thought you making a good point. I mean y'know, until you got cut off.|Yeah, what's up with that girl Monica?
I don't know! I didn't come with her!|All right everybody! Everybody guess what? I just convinced Paul to give us a test next week!
What are you doing?|I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy.
Why are you doing this?|Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I’ve already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You’ve got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven’t you ever been unemployed?|Hey, I am not unemployed. I’m on sabbatical!
Hey, don’t get religious on me, ok.  Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!|So what, we just sit?
Ohh, no, no. We’re not going to just sit.|Hello, Chandler Bing.
Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.|It’s been six months! It’s not funny!
But, I love you.|Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
Hey you guys, guess what?|The British are coming?
Ohh, you and your ways.  Since it’s Christmastime. I’m going to be one of those people collection donations.|Ohh.
Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.|Ohh.
Yeah, yeah, I’m going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I’m going to do the whole city.|You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I’m the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.  I lied.|Oh my god. Ok you guys, there’s Danny. Watch. Just watch this.  See?! Still pretending he’s not interested. Ohh, he’s coming over. Just pretend like we don’t know him. We’ve forgotten who he is.
How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.|Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
She’s a woman!|What can I say? She nailed it.
Okay, is there anything else?|Well, you’re just going to say no again but...gay porn.
Happy Holidays. Feliz Navidad. Allo, and Merry Christmas.|Phoebe!
Hey!|I just wanted to see how it's going.
Well, it's going okay.|Well good, here let me help you out.
Oh, thanks!|Yeah!
Is that a new Swede jacket? It looks really expensive.|Yeah. I guess.
Just get your nails done?|Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
Wait, you can't take the money out.|I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.|I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still…|Bite me, blondie!
That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!|I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
Wait a second, I could star in it!|Or that.
I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.|I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!|Yeah!
Thanks!|All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
Done!|And it can't be Joey.
It's not.|Or Joseph.
Hey, what's up?|I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.|Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
You had no relationship!!|No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.|She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
Hey, how do you spell suspicious?|Why?
Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.|Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
You're driving me crazy with that!|Okay, I'll stop.
Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.|You wanna play?
Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.|Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?|I'm intrigued.
All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.|Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.|Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
All right.  The official rulebook of Fireball.|Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!|You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
Now come on!|Hey!
I had a really nice time tonight.|So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.|You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch?  Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.|Hi!
Like it would help.|You are so bad!
You are!|You are!
You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.|
Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look!  Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?|No.
Does it look like an ashtray?|No.
Does it look like a urinal?|Eww!!
Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!|Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.|Hey!
Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!|Joey's not going.
Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?|Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.|I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.|I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?|If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
I paid for those tickets!|No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
…so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here  forgets the camera!|Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.|Here, I'll get it.
Yep.  I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.|Oh, great!
Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution!  I thought I told you to get outta here!|Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
What?!|Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
That chick can't handle my corner.|Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?|Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
What?! Why?!|Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and…
Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?|Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's…
Do-do you, do you have brothers?|No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
Are you close with them?|No-no, they're not very nice people.
Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?|Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of…
What?|Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?|Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game!  Last night!|No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!|Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
All right.|All right.
What is up?|About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.|Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest…  But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
Could I be more sorry.|I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist.  I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.|Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
I am sorry, Ross.|A handsome man enters.  well you co-created Fireball. The end.
This took you all day?!|No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball.  Ha-ha!
Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.|Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!|Suzie Villandry
Is there any entertainment there? What are people doing?|All right! Here we go! 1999! The year of Joey!
Y'know what? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no divorces in '99!|But your divorce isn't even final yet.
Just the one divorce in '99! Y'know what, I am gonna be happy this year. I am gonna make myself happy.|Do you want us to leave the room, or?
Everyday I am gonna do one thing that I haven't done before. That my friends is my New Year's resolution.|Ooh! That's a good one! Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks that you can't go the whole year without making fun of us. Eh, y'know what, better yet? A week.|I'll take that bet my friend. And you know what, paying me the 50 bucks could be the "new thing you do that day!"  And it starts right now!
Ohh.|Really?! How come?
I'll see you tomorrow.|Okay!  Hey!
Hey everybody, Rachel was so good today. She didn't gossip at all.|I didn’t! Even when I found out…umm, all right, well let's just say I found something out something about someone and let's just say she's gonna keep it.
Ooh, you nailed the Old Lady!|Yeah listen so, I thought I was getting better, so on my way home today I stopped by this guitar store and…
Did you, did you touch any of the guitars while you were there? Did you?!|No.
Give me your hands.  Pick. Do you want to learn to play guitar?|Yes!
Then don't touch one!!|Hi!
Are you hot?|No.
That was just the pants on the couch. Umm, hey, do you, do you mind if I use your bathroom?|No, go ahead.
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh……….|Hey, my favorite part is coming up!
Tiger!  Joseph, did you even study at all last night?|Yes! Yes, I did.
Then do Iceberg!|G-sharp.
G-sharp? Have you been studying the real names of the chords?  Oh my God!|What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
No, but you're questioning my method!|No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!
Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.|Your other student, was you!
Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!|
Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play Bad, Bad Leroy Brown!!|"Baddest man in the whole damn town."
Oh, fine! Take his side!|I can't wait to be with you! I'll sneak over as soon as Ross picks up Ben. I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
Hello?|Joey, it's Ross! I need some help!
Uhh, Chandler's not here.|Well, you can help me!
Okay.|Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom…
Nice!|No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!
Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?|Powder! Yeah! Yeah, I have powder!
Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up.|Yeah, okay, hold on!  They're not coming on man.
Umm, do you see any—oh, Vaseline?|Ohh, I-I see lotion, I have lotion! Will that work?
Yeah, sure, spread some of that on there.|Hold on.
Ross? You okay?|They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!
Really?! Uhh, what color is it?|What difference does that make?!
Well, I'm just—if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!|Joey, do you have a minute?
|Oh, Joey, I have such a problem!
Oh well, you're timing couldn't be better. I am putting out fires all over the place.|Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey, I have got to tell you something!
What-what is it, what is it?|Oh my God, it's so huge, but you just have to promise me that you cannot tell anyone.
Oh no, no-no-no-no! I don't want to know!|Yes! Yes! Yes, you do want to know! This is unbelievable!
I don't care, Rach! Look, I am tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets but can't tell anyone!|What? What secrets? You know secrets? What are they?
And you're not supposed to be gossiping!!|I know, I know! I just can't keep this one in, so I pick up the phone…
Ross, umm, you've been in there for a long time. I'm starting to get kinda freaked out.|All right, I'm coming out. Hey, can you turn the lights off.
Oh my God!|I had a problem.
Hey, Pheebs?|No, I can't talk to you! I don't have a fancy ad in the Yellow Pages!
Look, Pheebs, I just, I wanna apologize for, for saying that your method was stupid and-and maybe ask you to be my teacher again. And-and I promise, I won't touch a guitar until you say I'm ready.  You really think I'm ready?|Uh-huh!
Was the chord at least right…|No!
Oh my God!|We heard about your pants, I'm so sorry.
Oh yeah, me too. Y'know if this shirt is dirty.  Yep.|Okay, I'm gonna go too. I'm gonna go to the airport. I figure if I hang around there long enough, someone's bound to leave one of those planes unattended.
Come on Joey!!!|Rach, I told you everything I knew last night! Look, it's not that big of a deal, so Monica and Chandler are doing it.
I can't believe you would say that!|Sorry. Monica and Chandler are making love.
No! I mean come on! This is a huge deal!  Fine I want—I need more details, who-who initiated the first kiss?|I don't know.
Is he romantic with her?|I don't know.
Are they in love?|I don't know.
You don't know anything.|Ohh, I know one thing!
What?|They did it right there on the couch.
Hey Ross!|Hey!
Look at us all dressed up for the big office party! By the way, what are we celebrating?|Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party.
I think this is so cool because none of our friends are here and we can be a real couple. We don't have to hide.|I know, I can do this.
Ooh, and I can do this.|We can't do that.
Hi, nice to meet you!|Hi! And this is my wife Kara.
What was that?|What?
That noise you just made?|Oh, that was my work laugh.
Really? Your work laugh?|Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too.
All right, check me out.|Okay.
Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!|Really?
And! They like me more just because I was with ya! I think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met Joey. And Doug wants us to play tennis with them. He's never even talked to me outside of work. Except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club.  Strip church. Anyway, I'm gonna go try and find a racquet.|Hey, I thought you already had one.
Oh I used too, but then Joey thought it would be fun to go to Central Park and hit rocks at…bigger rocks.  Hey Rach, do you have a tennis racquet?|Oh umm, y'know I lent it to Joey and I never actually got it back.
Okay, good luck with that.|Hey!
You'll get your turn!|Hey Pheebs, what's going on?
Nothing!  This is not over!|No! No! No!
What?!|I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in…  Actually, thanks!
Bing!|Oww!!
Well, I gotta tell ya Bing; that partner of yours is a real tiger.  Are you all right sweethart?|I'm not all right.
We're, we're just gonna get a little sip of water.|Am I on fire today or what?! Those birds are browned, basted, and ready to be carved!
Uh Bing, I think we're gonna make this the last game.|Oh yes, sir! Put me out of my misery. Are you sure you never played pro?  Please let them win!
Nice shot.|I got it!!
I can't believe you let them win!|Yeah, at least you hid your feelings well about it.
I was frustrated.|It was my racquet.
I was frustrated with you!|If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
Y'know what really bothers me? Is—it's how-how different you act around them! I mean y'know the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh, the "I'll see you around, Bing!" "Not if I see you first, Doug!"  I gotta tell you, I don't like Work Chandler. Okay? The guy's a suck-up.|Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight.
I'm telling you, something's wrong! My brother does not stay out all night.|Maybe we should check the trash chute.
Oh my God!  Where the hell have you been?!!|Just, y'know out.
Uh-oh-okay. Uh-oh-okay. I know what you all are thinking. But Chandler is in Yemen! I'm a young woman! I have needs! I can't wait forever!|Yeah! No that's what I was thinking.
So I'm asking you please, take a moment before you judge me.|Oh, nobody's judging you.
Oh! Okay!|Okay, look, I-I know what you guys are going to say…
Okay, I have to tell you something that I have never admitted during our entire friendship! But, when we were in high school I made out with James Farrell even when I knew that you liked him! Wow, that feels so good to get off my chest! Okay, you go!|My turn? What-what are you talking about?
Ugh, Monica, I know about you and Chandler.|What?!
I overheard you guys on the phone the other day, and you said, "I'll just tell Rachel that I'm doing laundry for a couple of hours." And he said, "Laundry? Is that my new nickname?" And you said, "No! You know what your nickname is, Mr. Big."|Well. Sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there Rach. Wow! Let me know how that one turns out.
Well, I wouldn't know because I got so freaked out that I hung up the phone.|Well, if you had kept listening, you-you would have heard me call him Mr. Big……ot.
What?!|Mr. Bigot. He tells the most racist jokes.
All right. So you're telling me that there is nothing going on between you and Chandler.|Me and Chandler?!
All right, put your 20 bucks down. First one to find the tasty treat wins. Okay?|Uh-hmm.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.|Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules, no violation.|Ohhh.
Yeah!|Y'know what? It sounds so weird to say this but, I just had a great day with Janice!
What?!|Are you serious?!
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!|No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.|Ohh, tough call.
But seriously, I believe that we should all support President Clinton. And her husband Bill.|So how do you kids like your coffee?
Well, maybe I'll bring it out and have Monica stick her finger in it. That oughta sweeten it up, huh?|How does that laugh not give you a headache?
Did you hear what I said Bing?|What?
The joke Bing. What's the matter with you?|Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir.
Excuse me?|Well, I just…
Hey Rach! Hey, you mind if I read my comic books in here?|Sure! Why?
Oh well, Chandler and Monica are over there and it's kinda hard to concentrate.|What?! She just called and said that she was gonna be working late! She keeps lying to me! That's it! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go over there and confront them right now!
All right, so you're telling me that I have to tell racist jokes now?!|Sorry! I'm just—I'm not very good at this! I'm a terrible liar and I hate having to lie to Rachel!
But we're not ready to tell yet!|I know! It's just that…ever since high school Rachel was the one person I told everything too. Y'know? I miss that so much now. She's my best friend.
Here you go.|Thanks!
Dude, we got to talk.|Okay.
I just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and I hope this isn't too weird, but uh, I had uh, a thing with Janice.  What you're-you're not mad?|Why would I be mad?
Well, because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff. You don't uh, you don't fool around with your uh, friend's ex-girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they're related to.|I am mad! But you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna forgive you! Because that's what friends do! They forgive their friends when they do everything you just said, all on the list there. Well, but I want you to remember that I forgave you.
Okay.|I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
All right.|And, I want you to remember that I gave you twenty  seven dollars. No strings attached. Now, if you can't remember that, I think we should write it down—let's write it down!
I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!|Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
That was a half an hour?|It's your timer.
Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!|All right, then massage me up right nice!
It's so good, isn't it?|It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
Say good-bye to sore muscles!|Good-bye muscles!!
I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just—I didn't know what it was!|Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.|Hey.
|This would be the place where you explain the hat.
And you're gonna make them all disappear.|Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
Done.|Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
Hey.|Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?|All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.|Really? A purse?
It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.|It looks like a women's purse.
No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look.  See look, men, carrying the bag.|See look, women, carrying the bag.  But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
Exactly! Unisex!|Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.|Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
Who is it?|It's Phoebe.
Oh great!  Oh, you. Umm, what's up?|Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
Umm, yeah—no thanks.|Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?|No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.|No you didn't!
Well, then who's been dead for five years?|Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So… I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.|Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
Hey!|Hey!
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!|Your make-up!
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.|Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
Why would I return it? I love this bag!|All right, then you owe me $350.
Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?|Joey…
All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.|What's the part, Anti-man?
Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.|Hi sweetie!
Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!|Here, I brought you some flowers.
Thanks!|Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
Yeah, welcome.|Hello. Hello.
Umm here's your 3-D glasses.|Oh, umm, all right.
So how did you know Francis?|Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
Really?! What's your name?|Umm, Frank Buffay.
You're Frank Buffay?|Shh!  No! Joe Hill!
You just said…|Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
Oh my God!|What?! What honey?
That was my dad!|Oh my God!
Oh, did you catch him?!|Uh-huh.
Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?|Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey,|All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
Any time you're ready, Joey.|Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?|Yeah, sure.
Sure. What?|Well, first it's not a purse.
Okay, anytime.|I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
Okayyyy! Anddd, go!|All right look, let me show you the catalog!  See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
Umm, do you sell these bags?|Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
Okay! Thank you! That was great!|Yeah but I didn’t read anything.
I think we've seen enough!|Okay! All right, I'll see ya.  We got it! We got it!
Hey, is Rachel here?|No.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.|Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me—just say, "I don't like your massages."
I don't like your massages.|See? It's no big deal.
Okay, but now see you're crying!|I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
What?|My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.|Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.|I'm crying here!!
Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.|Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!|So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
Absolutely!|Okay. I suck!
Umm, thank you for meeting with me.|Thank you. All right.
Come, sit.  Umm, all righty, before we get started I just—I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.|Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
Okay.|So, what did Francis leave me?
Huh?|Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
Oh yes. Yes. Yeah—no. She did. She left you umm,  this lipstick.|Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's  oh it's—ew used. Umm, cool.
Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms.  You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?|Yes, yes I was.
Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?|It really says that?!
Yeah. See?|Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?|Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much.
What?!|Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
But you-you-you came to see Lilly?|Yeah, yeah. Why?
Lilly's dead.|She what?!
She's dead.|Are you sure?
Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.|I can't believe this. I just—I can't believe this. How-how—Oh my God. How long ago?
17 years ago.|Oh! What about, what about the girls?
Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!|Phoebe, I-I-I-umm,  I just, I-I-I-I don’t, I don’t know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.|So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
Y'know what, it doesn’t matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.|All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
That's a defense?|Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
You make up songs?|Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
Hi.|Hey!
Estelle said I didn't get it.|What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.|What kind of problem?
Well to tell you the truth, they uh,  they had a problem with the bag!|Oh my God!
Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!|Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach?  Oh, you think I should give up the bag!|Honey wait, Joey, I’m sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it…
I can't believe I'm hearing this!|Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn’t have a bag, I just—it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm,  controversial.
Oh hey, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy is putting stuff in boxes!|I'd say from the looks of it; our naked buddy is moving.
Oh my God! I love this apartment! Isn't it perfect?! I can't believe I never realized how great it is!|Well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.
|Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm gonna go use Ugly Naked Guy's bathroom.
What's going on?|Ohhh!!!
What?! What?!|Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
Actually, it looks really good.|
You mean whenever Monica and Chandler where like y'know doing laundry or going grocery shopping or—Oh! All that time Monica spent on the phone with sad Linda from camp!|Uh-huh, doing it. Doing it. Phone doing it.
Oh! Oh, I can't believe it! I mean I think it's great! For him. She might be able to do better.|Hey guys!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?|Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.|Wh-what do you mean?
Well y'know every time that they say that like they're doing laundry we'll just give them a bunch of laundry to do.|Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!
No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!|Noo! I can't take any more secrets!  I've got your secrets. I've got their secrets. I got secrets of my own y'know!
Well, you could use your position y'know as the roommate.|Okay.
And then. I would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal. My sexuality.|Hello children!
Okay, watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.|Hey.
Hey! Ooh, wow that jacket looks great on you!|Really?
Yeah the material feels so soft—hello Mr. Bicep! Have you been working out?|Well, I try to y'know, squeeze things.  Are you okay?
Well, if you really wanna know, I'm—Oh! I can't tell you this.|Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything.
Well actually you're the one person I can't tell this too. And the one person I want to the most.|What's going on?
You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?|Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.
Okay, now you're even cuter!!|Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
What?|The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me.
What are you talking about?|I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
That's not possible!|Ow!
I'm sorry it's just, Phoebe just always thought you were, you were charming in a, in a sexless kind of way.|Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough.
I'm sorry, I think that you just misunderstood her.|No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!
This bicep?|Well it's not flexed right now!
Hey Mon, what are you doing now? Wanna come see a movie with us?|Uhh, y'know actually I was gonna do some laundry.
Oh.|Hey Chandler, wanna do it with me?
Okay great, hold on a sec!  Oh, here you go! You don't mind do ya? That would really help me out a lot! Thanks!|I mean I-I don't I think I have enough quarters.
Hey Ross! Any word on the apartment yet?|Well, I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants.
Oh.|No-no, I got the edge. I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to
What?! You-you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?|Well yeah! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins. It was the best day.
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Bye!
Joey!|Yeah?
Phoebe knows about us!|Well I didn't tell them!
Oh man!|I'm sorry! But hey, it's over now, right? Because you can tell them that you know they know and I can go back to knowing absolutely nothing!
Noooo.|Oh Ross, honey you gotta stop torturing yourself!
Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one!|Y'know what you should do?
Huh?|You should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him. Yeah! Like if I would strike up a conversation about say umm, sandwiches. Or uh, or my underwear.
That is a great idea! And! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge! Oh, let's see now he had the trampoline.|He broke that.
Well, he had gravity boots.|Yeah, he broke those too.
Okay, I've got to go pick up Ben but I-I will figure something out.  Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?|I wouldn't bring that up, it would probably just bum him out.
Right.|Hello!  It's Chandler.
Look at them, they're-they're panicked!|Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!
All right. All right! If he wants a date? He's gonna get a date. All right, I'm gonna go in.|All right. Be sexy.
So Chandler, I-I'd love to come by tonight.|Really?
Oh absolutely. Shall we say, around seven?|Yes.
Good. I'm really looking forward to you and me having sexual intercourse.|Hey-hey, check it out! Check it out! Ugly Naked Guy has a naked friend!
Show time!|Okay, Rachel, get me perfume!
Okay!|And Joey, get me a bottle of wine and glasses?
All right, it'll be great! You just make her think you wanna have sex with her! It'll totally freak her out!|Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?
Relax, she-she's gonna give in way before you do!|How do you know?!
Because you're on my team! And my team always wins!|At this?!
Okay honey, now I'm gonna try to listen from right here!|Okay.
Okay? Whoa, wait!|Good idea!
Yeah, oh wait!|Oh now, don't give away the farm!
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!|She's bluffing!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?! I wanna sit in my chair!
Joey!  Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.|It's not my first time.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!|Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?
Oh, you're-you're going?|Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very were gonna be having all the sex.|You should be. I'm very bendy.  I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.|Ooh.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.|Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!|And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!|You're-you're what?!
Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.|I love you too Chandler.
And hats off to Phoebe. Quite a competitor.  And might I say your breasts are still showing.|God!
A new place for a new Ross. I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know, furnished.|I must say it's nice to see you back on your feet.
Well I am that. And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me.|I wonder if its time for you to rejoin our team at the museum?
Chandler!!! Chandler!!!  Chandler, I saw what you were doing through the window! Chandler, I saw what you were doing to my sister! Now get out here!|
What the hell are doing?!!|Hey, what's-what's going on?!
I thought you were my best friend, this is my sister! My best friend and my sister! I-I cannot believe this!|Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her.
You guys probably wanna get some hugs in too, huh? Big news!|Awww, no, it's okay, we've actually known for a while.
What? What? What?! You guys knew?  You all knew and you didn't tell me?!!|Well, Ross, we were worried about you. We didn't know how you were going to react.
|Okay, all right, whew! What do you say we all clear out of here and let these two lovebirds get back down to business?  Hey-hey-hey, I-I-I'm just talking here, he-he's the one doing your sister.
Hey, you know what I just realized? If you guys ever have kids…|Whoa-whoa-whoa! We're having kids?!
You can't just call Godfather. Don't you think her brother should be Godfather?|Sure, if you cared enough to call it first.
Hey!|Hey! I brought you some house warming gifts.
Aww.|Yeah. Salt, so your life always has flavor.
Huh.|Bread, so you never go hungry.
Ohh.|And a scented candle for the bathroom, because well, y'know.
Thanks. Thanks. And thanks again.|Yeah!
Hi!|Welcome to the building. I'm uh, Steve Sarah; I'm president of the tenants committee.
Oh hi! Ross Geller. And this is my friend Phoebe.|Oh hi Phoebe.
Howard?|Yeah, he's the handy man. He's gonna be retiring next week and everyone who lives here is kicking in a 100 bucks as a thank you for all the hard work type of thing.
Oh that's nice.|Yeah. So, do you want to give a check? Or…
Oh. Uhh…|Oh look, you don't have to give it too me right now! You can slip it under my door.
No-no, it's not that, it's just… I-I just moved in.|Well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.
Yes, but I've lived here for 25 minutes.|Oh, okay, I get it.
No wait, look. Look! I'm sorry, it's just I've never even met Howard. I-I mean I don't know Howard.|Howard's the handy man!
Yes but too me he's just, man.|Okay, fine, whatever. Welcome to the building.
Ugh, can you believe that guy!|Yeah. I really like his glasses.
…so then President Steve told everyone that I was a cheapskate, and now the whole building hates me! A little kid spit on my knee! Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna throw a party. That's right. For everyone in the building, and I'm gonna sit them down and explain to them, I am not a bad guy. I am not a cheap guy! I'm just a guy who-who stands up for what he believes in. A man with principles.|Sounds like a fun party.
It doesn't matter! It's my principles! We're talking about my principles!|Okay, I thought it was about your neighbors liking you.
Oh, they'll like me. Once they come to my awesome PAR-TAY! Okay, I gotta run. I gotta go get some nametags.|And that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.
You were so funny with that waiter! You're such a nut!|Y'know, breadstick fangs are always funny.
No, you make them funny. You're the funny one!|Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.
Isn't this great?|Hmm.
Couldn't you just stay like this forever?  Chandler! Couldn't you just stay here forever?|Yeah, here, somewhere else, y'know where-where ever.
Are you okay?|Yeah, I'm cool. Casual.
What-what are you doing?|I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually.
Man, I knew it! I knew you were going to do this!!|What?!
Get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff.|Well, you do want all that stuff, right?
Oh and you know what I want!|Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
I do not have baby fever!|Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!
Have you lost your mind? Chandler, this isn't about me! This is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap!|Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
You don't know everything. Did you know that I'm going out with Rachel tonight instead of you? Hmm? And did you know that the only baby around here is you?! And did you know that I can't even look at you right now?!|Well, I did not know that.
It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable.|Oh yeah, yeah, sure. Absolutely.
By me?|Oh, no!
Monica.|I'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.
Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.|What?!
Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again.|Really? I'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. You're gonna have to figure this one for yourself. All right? Y'know what? If you're too afraid to be in a real relationship, then don't be in one.
Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Howard! Yay!!|Phoebe!
Hey!|Hi! Wow! You look, you look…big.
Thanks! I've been working out. Hey listen, is it obvious that I'm wearing six sweaters?|Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.
Well look, I’m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?|Hi!
Hey! Hiya!|Hey! Hey, cute jacket!
Huh.|Well? Aren't you gonna do something?
Uhh….|You'd better do something, or I'm gonna walk out that door right now! Well? Are you gonna?
Phoebe?|
Phoebe? Phoebe?|Ooh.
Look, this is a disaster! Can't I please just go?|No! No! I'm talking you up to people. Just give it a little time, all right? Relax, get something to eat! Okay?
So uh, what did you tell them about me?|Oh, I was telling them about you and Emily. Y'know, try to get some sympathy.
Ohh.|But somehow you came off as the bad guy.
What?!|Yeah, I think I told it wrong. Y'know, we should talk about that because I don't totally understand what happened there.
Ohh, this cake is really good!|Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!
Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.|Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.
Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?|I'm Monica.
I need to talk to you, it's urgent!|Okay.
Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking about us, y'know a lot of uhh, us thinking. And uh, well I guess there's only one-one way to do this.|Wait what-wh-wh-what are you doing?!
Monica…|No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!
Will you marry me?|Oh-no. No. No.
I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.|Chandler.
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?|Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?
No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.  Will you be my wife?|Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.
Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.|Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!
Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.|Who? Two divorces and Joey?!
I didn't think I was!|Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?
Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?|No, I will not!
Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.|You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?
That's not funny at all!|Alicia Sky Varinaitis
Hey!|Hey!
What are you guys doing up?|Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?
Dark red.|Yeah, I think that's wrong, but there's a Connect the Dots in here for you later.  Hey, how about maroon?
Aww, you guys are so cute!|I know.
All right, I'll see you in the morning.|Okay.
Y'know, I love doing crossword puzzles with you honey!|Aww, me too. Now let's finish this and go to bed.
Okay! There's only one left, three letter word, not dog but…|Cat.
Yes! You are so smart!  I love you.|I love you too.
Uhh, we still need a tip.|All right. Hold on.  How much more do we need?
A couple of bucks.|Okay, dime!  Oh my God, this is a police badge!
Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.|Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!
Hey Joey!|Hey.
Ugh!|"Come here to me!"
What?! You say that to kids?!!|No! No! No! The "Come here to me" is y'know for the ladies.
Ross, honey, it's a nice couch. It's not a magic couch.|You picked a great couch.
Wait! No, that's ridiculous. Come on, he lives three blocks away!|Yeah, y'know what? I'll take it myself, thank you!
Yeah!  Are you kiddin'?|Oh, come on it's only three blocks! And-and, it's not very heavy, try it! Come on! Come on!
Oh. Oh! I can do it!|Yeah!
Ross!|What's that supposed to mean?
Come on, I don't really want to be doing this right now. I am carrying a very heavy couch.|Then tell him quickly.
We went out.|Not only did we go out, we did it 298 times!
Ross!! Oh my--ugh!! You kept count?! You are such a loser!|A loser you did it with  298 times!
Oh. Oh! Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am?|Yes?
You can't put your cigarette out on a tree!|Yeah I can, it worked real well.
No but you shouldn't! Don't ever do that again.|I won't!  Until I have my next cigarette.
Hold it!  N.Y.P.D! Freeze punk!|What?!
Yeah that's right you are so busted.  Book 'em.|Who are you talking too?
Save it Red! Unless you wanna spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.|I am not going to apologize to a tree!
You apologize to the tree right now or I am calling for backup.  Backup! Backup!!|I-I'm sorry! Sorry.
Okay.|Ross, didn't you say that there was an elevator in here?
Okay, go left. Left! Left!|Okay, y'know what? There is no more left, left!
Oh okay, lift it straight up over your head! Straight up over your head! You can do it! You can do it!  Okay. You got it?|Yeah.
Good-good-good.|Oh-oh!
Yeah, you got it right? You got it right? You got it?|Any chance you think the couch looks good there?
…so this guy was all  It was just so cool!|Phoebe, you were supposed to take that back!
I know but I'm having so much fun doing good deeds.|Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested.
Hey.|Oh.
Excuse me, is this your car?|Yeah.
Well I don't think it's very nice of you to park here, y'know you're blocking the entrance.|Don't worry about it. It's not a problem.
Well, it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you 'cause I'm a cop.|So am I!
Ohh, no.|Hey, wait a second! So wait, what precinct are you with?
I-I'm with the umm, the 57th.|Oh, I know a guy in homicide up there.
I'm in vice. Yeah, in fact I'm undercover right now. I'm a whore.|Who-who else is in vice up there?
Umm, do you know, umm Sipowicz?|Sipowicz? No, I don't think so.
Yeah, big guy, kinda bald.|No, I don't know him.
Don’t try to call him or anything, 'cause he's not there, he's out. His umm, his partner just died.|Wow umm, tell Sipowicz I'm real sorry for his loss.
I-I sure will, take care.|And where did you find my badge?
Hey! Joey, would you mind giving me and Ross a hand moving his couch?|Oh, I'd love too, but I got acting class. But y'know what? I guess I can blow that off,  for you.
Thanks!|Uh, hey, Rach let me ask you something. Uh, I was just over there talking to Monica and Chandler, boy they are really tight.
I know.|Yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there. I'm thinking of getting me one of those.
What's up Joe?|Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great…
Yeah?|…is because they were friends first. Y'know? So I asked myself, "Who are my friends?" You and Phoebe, and I saw you first. So…
What are you saying?|I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.
Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.|I'll treat you real nice.
Yeah, well, y'know umm… No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!|Won't-won't that take longer?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, but once you find it, ohh it's so worth the wait.|Yeah. I understand. I understand.  Man, I wish I saw Phoebe first!
Come here to me. No-no, you come here to me.|Hey Ross! I brought reinforcements.
Oh great! What, you brought Joey?|Well, I brought the next best thing.
Chandler?! You brought Chandler?! The next best thing would be Monica!|Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so…
Look, I-I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.|Whoa-oh, what's-what's that?
Oh, that's me.|Wow! You certainly think a lot of yourself.
No! That's-that's my arm!|Oh, I see. I thought you just really, really liked your new couch.
Y'know what? Just-just follow my lead.|Okay!
All right, ready?|Yeah.
Turn.|Okay.
Turn! Turn!|Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!
Oh yeah it will! Come on, up! Up-up-up! Up! Yes! Here we go! Pivot!  Pivot! Piv-ot! Piv-et!! Piv-ett!!! Piv-et!|Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
Okay, I don't think it's going to pivot anymore.|You think?!
All right, let's uh, let's bring it back down and-and try again.|Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now.
I can't believe that didn't work!|I know, me neither! I mean, you had a sketch!
Hey!|Hey! How's it going? Did you make any new friends?
Yeah, yeah, I met this woman.|Hey, whoa-whoa! What's she like?
Uhh, well, she's…really good in bed.|Joey, I thought you were gonna try to be friends first!
Well look, hey, it's all your fault!|What?! Why?!
Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!|What about the closeness?
All right! Hey, who wants pizza?!|Ooh, I do! I do! I do!
Oh, great! Can you believe I found it on the second floor?|Who is it?
Uhh, just a minute officer!!|I'm looking for Phoebe Buffay!
You wanna return this couch?  It's cut in half!|That's what I'm telling you.
Did you cut this couch in half?|This couch, is cut in half! I would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half!
You're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?!|Look, I am a reasonable man. I will accept store credit.
I'll give you store credit in the amount of four dollars.|I take it.
Good, you guys are all here!|Hey! What's up?
Well, I have a job interview at Ralph Lauren tomorrow!|Congratulations! Ohh, that's great!
I know!|Boy, that guy's underwear sucks!
Wh-what?!|I got this pair marked excess, I gotta tell ya, there was no room for excess anything in there.
Anyway, I'm going to be the coordinator of the woman's collection, I'll work right under the director, it's the perfect, perfect job for me!|Wow! Well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it!
Yeah.|You wanna work on your interview skills?
O-okay!|Okay! All right, let's start with the handshake. Hi.
Hi.|Very good handshake, good wrist action.
That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday,  same as the day before.|Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.|Get in there man! Flirt back, mix it up!
Yeah, I-I-I'm down with that.  Okay, I-I-I'll be right over. Let's see, she's on the third floor…|Wow! She is pretty, huh?
Hey Joey! Great stuff huh?|This is your place?
Of course it is. Yeah, come on in. Ooh-ooh, go by the window you can pretend to be surfing.|But I counted, you're not supposed to live here! Oh man!
Ugh!!|What happened?
I ended up at Ross's place. Oh, I musta missed counted or something.|No Joey, I think he's just watchin' TV.
We've lost visual contact with the suspect.|Okay, now I've really have to go!
Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.|All right, you go.
Oh hey, how'd the interview go?|Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
So what happened?|Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!"  Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.|Thanks Chandler.
Come on, Rach.|Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
Damnit!! Did you move?!|Yes. I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place.  I'm Ross.
Uhh do you happen to have a hot girl in there?|No. I'm all alone.
Yeah. Sorry about that.  Oh, hey little girl. Uhh, is-is your mommy, or sister, or babysitter by any chance a hot girl?|Daddy!!
Hi Rachel!|Hi!
It's really nice to see you again.|Thank you.
|What?
Just ah…|Excuse me?
Here let me…|
Okay-okay that-that's amazing. How did you know that?|You got ink on your lip.
So what do you say, maybe sometime I hold your gun?|I don't know man, we're really not supposed to do that.
Oh, what can happen? I mean, would you…|Yeah, I'm gonna say no.
Uh, yeah.|Okay.  We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
Why?|'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
Ohh, so?|So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
Hey!|You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.|I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
Nevermind!|No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm…|Jen.
Jen, I know this may sound a little… But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or…|Sure! That would be nice.
Umm?|Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.
I will give you a call.|I'll see you later.
Okay!|I forgot my paper.
That was amazing!|Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
That was amazing.|We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
No, you're the best.|No, you're the best.
So uhh, you ready?|Sure, I'll just get my coat.  Could you get that?
Sure.  Joey…|Dahhhhh!!
Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.|That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.|Fair enough.
Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah,  courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr…|Zelner.
Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.|Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
Oh! You are?|Um-hmm.
Really? Oh thank you! Oh… Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?|Yes!
You tired Chandler?|You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
Ohh,  umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.|Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so…
We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!|The park huh? A public place.
Hi Chandler.|Monica! This is the Men's room!  Isn't it?
Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?|No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
Come on, we can't let them win!|Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!|So?
I feel really sad that we're not…really there anymore.|Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?|Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
Really?|Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.|Yeah?
Yeah.|Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
Did not.|Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
Okay, I freaked out a little.|Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up!  And now we're back.
I cannot believe Ross is buying this!|Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.|
Okay, pick a card.|Okay.
All right now, memorize it.  You got it?|Oh yes.
|Yes.
Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.|I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings…
I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!|That.
Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!|Luck!
Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day…|Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
Okay guys, way to wish me luck!|Good luck! Go get 'em!
Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!|Really? That's great!
I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her…|Hey, that kid looks familiar.
Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad….|Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?|Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
I look more like him than you do!|Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?|Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric  Sorry.
Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.|She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
Rachel? Do you smoke?|Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories……about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
…and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!|That doesn't seem fair.
I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!|Yeah, it is the best.
I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?|Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
Yeah, I can do that.|Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
I would love to!|Oh good!
Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?|Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.|Oh great!
So anyway we really…  Honey, we're just smoking all over you.|Oh, sorry!
No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.|So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
Oh that's great! You are the best!|Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those?  Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
We get high.|Oh, me too.
I'm kidding.|Oh, me too.
Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?|Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so…
Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!|Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
Yeah!|Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two
Yeah, it is.|Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.|Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
Hey!|Hi!
Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?|Ah sure. What's in 'em?
Umm, cups.|Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.|Y'know I rued the day once…didn't get a whole lot else done.
Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!|Hey Pheebs!  Hey!
How did work go?|Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
You stink!|Thanks!
No, I'm-I'm serious!|Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
That's so gross!|No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.|I think you smell great!
So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?|Absolutely!
Rachel didn't you just light that?|Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know?  Good luck, Rach.
Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like|Tell me about it!
It does sound appealing.|Oh, I never could do it.
Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!|Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
My late husband gave me that lighter.  I'm not kidding.|Okay then!
Hmmm, soup!  Hmm, soup!|Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
Oh yeah, no problem.|Thanks.
Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.|Joey!
Ross!|I mean, Ben! Ben!
Hi!|Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready.
Uh-oh.|Is there a problem?
Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.|Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
Oh, what did I say?|Hmm, noodle soup.
How's that different?  Oh! Yeah!|All right, let's try one.
Hmm, noodle soup.|Okay. Let's do it again.
Hmm, soup.  I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!|COME ON!!!!
Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!|Uh-oh, busted!
Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!|Yeah. That didn't work out.
Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?|No. No! You're doing great! Don’t you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.|Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
Okay.|So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
|Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
Ahhh! Mystical!|Awesome!
Oh, look! Look! Look!|Surprise!!
I was in charge of cups.|Oh, okay, not so weird.
Hey!|Hey.
Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.|Yeah right!
No really, I-I am! I feel bad!|Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.|What you do mean?
I think, sub-consciously…|Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.|Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor…
No!|No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
There you go. Thank you!|Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
No.|Eh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.|Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
Okay, great.|
Hey!|Hey!
Wow! You look nice. What's the occasion?|Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George.
Wow! How'd you get in there?|Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert.
What the hell was that?!|What?
The flirting! Aren't you supposed to be going out with, I don't know hmm, let's say my sister?!|I was not flirting.
It was totally flirting. "Somebody got a haircut "|Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all.
Yeah, right.|You wanna see flirting? I'll show you flirting.
I am so proud of Joey, I can't believe he's going to be on Law & Order!|I know. But don't you think that it should be called Order and Law?
No because first they arrest the guy and then they try him.|Don't get me started on that.
What's going on?|Chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl!
Ross! We broke up two years ago; you've been married since then. I think it's okay that we see other people.|Well, I-I was watching her the other day at the pizza place.
Hm-mmm.|And she's just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little…
Okay, y'know what? We don't need her measurements.|Okay pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni, okay Ross, I know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?! She forgot my vegetarian!
Big night!|This is so cool!
Oh, umm, okay, yeah, I'll be, yeah I'll be right back.|Wow Pheebs, you speak Italian?
Here you go. Thank you!|Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?
Oh what, you-you want both of them?|Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!
Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it. I know it's in the apartment, but I definitely lost it.|Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!
Tell her to wear her own earrings.|These are her earrings.
Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!|Why not?
Oh umm, my big scene is coming up. Big scene coming up.|If you said, "Big lima bean, bubbling up." Would she understand the difference?
|Chandler, this actually bothers you?
Okay, here's my big scene. My big scene's here!  Oh my God.|What?
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill my grandmother if she finds out.|Well, what is it?
Oh, they cut me out of the show.|What?!
Not likely.  'Cause you see that body bag right there|Yeah.
This is terrible, what are you going to do?|I don't know. This little, old lady lives for my career. When they dumped me off of Days of Our Lives she almost died.
That's not good.|
But I already gave them back to you!|No you didn't.
All right, I already didn't give them back to you, that's what I said.  Where is that other earring?|It's not here Pheebs, it's not here. Ohh, I went to Joey and Chandler's last night! Okay!
Make sure you check Chandler's jewelry box.|Wait a minute. Chandler has a jewelry box?
Okay, we have like ten minutes. Do you want me to get into that now?!|Hey Pheebs! How's that uh, vegetarian pizza working out for ya? You and those vegetables have a real thing going on, huh?
Why are you being weird?|Do you like it?
No, that would be, "Why are you being cute?"|Okay, I'm working on my flirting.
So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?|Yeah, it's good.
See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!|Chandler!  Okay, let me get this straight, it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me.
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women.|Go on, teach me something about men and women.
Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, "I'm just flirting, no big deal." But the guy is thinking, "Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"|No way!
It's true.|Well that's pathetic!
Again true.|And this goes for all guys?
All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.|All right, it's another commercial; I still haven't told her!
Hey!|Did you find it?
The earring? No. But look, I found my sunglasses under the couch! I've been looking for these since like last summer.|Okay, those are my sunglasses, you borrowed them from me.
Okay, calm down, here they are.|
I don't know, I don't know.|All right well, we're just gonna have to tell Monica, that's all.
Oh gosh, she's going to kill me.|I suppose I could tell her it's just all my fault.
Ohh that'd be great!|Mon, can I talk to you for a sec?
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, I-I-I, I can't do this. Listen honey, this is, it's not Phoebe's fault. She lent me the earrings, and I lost it. I'm so sorry. Honey, I feel terrible too.|Okay?! I mean, first it's my jewelry! And if it's not my jewelry, it's-it's my blue sweater! And if it's not my sweater, it's my sunglasses!
Your sunglasses?!|Yes!
Honey, you have nothing to prove. And if you really like this girl, I don't flirting is the right thing to…|You'll see. Okay.  Oh, what's-what's her name?
I'm sorry.|Look, no-no, hey, hey, don't worry about it! In nine years, she and I will be right there.
Okay, well, I'm gonna clear out some of these boxes.|Ross?
Hey! Hey!  Hi! Hey-hey-hey, I'm Rachel! From upstairs? The ones with all the pizza?|Oh, is there a problem?
No. No. Every thing's--they're fine. Great pizza. But it's uh, actually umm my friend Ross. He uh, just gets really nervous when he's flirting.|Oh my God! That was flirting?!
Yeah.|Wow!
I know, I know, but uh just, I'm telling you, once, once you get past that part, that where it-it just feels like you wanna die, he's-he's really a good person.|The guy with the gas?!
Yeah. I'm-I'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh, got a good heart. And besides, I y'know, I think he really likes you.|Really?!
Well y'know, we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas, what do you think?|I just, I thought Joey was there.
Hey Ross? Umm, I just ran into Caitlin in the hallway and-and uh, you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than I thought.|What do you mean?
Well, I don't get it, but she wanted me to give you her phone number.|And she just gave you this?
Yeah!|Rach, thanks but uh, I don't need you doing me any favors.
I-I-I didn't! I didn't! She thought you were cute.|Well that I can believe.
Yay!|Hey! Is the show still on?
What about these? These look the same?|Definitely!
Not as each other!|Oh, then no.
Hi!|You ready?
Yeah.|You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
Ohh, you're about to get a little luckier.|Let me see the earrings.
Oh, honey, the earrings…|They look great! Does your boyfriend have the best taste or what?
My boyfriend really does have good taste!|Thanks for picking out the earrings man.
Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.|Oh, yeah, good idea.
Hey!|How are you?
Ohh, thank God! Finally!|Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know… And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.|You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
Great! Thanks!|All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?|I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?|Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.|All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?|Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around…
What?!|What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.|It is starting to get dark out there.
He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!|Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?|It's called the cherry.
It's the—Chandler!!|Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.|Did I say you could smell it?!
I can't smell your sandwich?|Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
Okay, I'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich?|Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
Okay.|Are you thinking about Monica?
Yeah.|Yeah, what's that like?
Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!|Rach! It's me! Pick up!
Hey! What's up?!|I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
So all we have is ice?|See if he has ice.
Okay.|I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
So where are we going next?|This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
Yeah, no one talks like that!|Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
Hey, I'm more cop than you two!|How do you figure that?
Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!|Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
Umm, jealous!|Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
Yeah, no problem.|Ross!
Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.|Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.|Nooo!
Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!|No. But that reminds me,  sign this.
Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.|Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
What's going on?|Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
Uh, HELLO!!|Hi.
All right, I guess we should go.|No, wait. Wait.
Oh yeah right!|No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!|Yeah well unless we tell him.
Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.|Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!|Right?
Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?|John Glenn is here?!
No, Joey!|Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car…
Wait! Hold on!  Hi!|Hi!
Okay, go ahead.|Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.|Who jumps at loud noises!
So you wanna get some dinner?|Yeah! Sure! Yep!  Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.|Okay!
All right.|Bye!
Dude! How come you took off?|Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever…
Is something wrong?|No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
Okay.|You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!|I do not hate Ross!
Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.|What picture?
I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!|Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I…knew…you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!|When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.|From a bullet!
I know it doesn't make much sense…|Much sense?!
Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!|So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!|So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!|Really?!
Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me,  here.|Thanks.
How good is that?|Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
See?|Hm-hmm.
Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!|I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
Hey! Hi!|Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!|Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?|The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
What?! What? What happened?!|Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
Yeah!|And somebody took a shot at me!
Really?!|No, a car backfired, but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I…I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
Because a car backfired?|Okay, why are you here?
Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.|You talked to her?
No, she left a message.  something wrong with your machine.|Well, okay, what-what did she say?
Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.|Wow!
Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?|Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because—I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me—not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right.  Your decision.|Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?|Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!|You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.|Huh.
I mean, look-look today you escaped  death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?|That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
Well, there you go!|Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
Close call day.|Hey, thanks Rach.
Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.|Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
Oh?|Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
No.|Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
Yeah.|Yeah, I want my money back.
Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?|Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.|Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.|Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
Would you like some more coffee, baby-doll?|I'm fine, thanks.
So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?|I know, really well. In fact, I'm gonna ask Phoebe to move in with me.
Oh my God!|What do you, what do you think?
I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?|Tonight, but don't say anything. Okay?
I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral…|
Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!|What?! Really?!
He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!|I can't believe this!
Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!|Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!
Ohhhh!|No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!
That is so sweet!|
Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?|Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.
Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.|Also an island.
Hey, what time is it?|2:17.
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?|Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.|Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal!  Yeah, my pants are a little loose!|Hey, you guys…
Hey!|Is Monica here?
What the hell is that?!!|It's a, it's a cat!
That, is not a cat! {I have to agree with Joey on this one.}|Yes it is!
It's not a cat!|All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!
Uhh, the ball thing.|Yeah?
Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!|Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!
Uh-oh.|What?
Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!|I know!  Don't switch hands, okay?
Hey ladies! What are you in here for?|Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.|Yeah?
It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.|What's up?
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.|Sure. Okay.
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!|Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.
You mean scared.|No, I mean happy.
Scared? Happy?|Chandler, what-what are you doing?
I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!|I know! I can't wait!
Were you're parents happy, or something?|Listen Chandler, the way I see it is that I was lucky enough to find someone that I really love. I just—I wanna be around her as much as I can.
Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.|So you know what I'm talking about, right?
Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!|No, it's too soon for you guys.
…now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!|Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.
How do you know? You don't have a watch.|Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!
Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!|Yeah, we haven't dropped it in…
2 hours, 27 minutes.|Really?!
|Hey Rach!
Rach?|Yeah?
You have scratches all over you, what happened?|Well, it's my cat.
What?!|Oh yeah, I got a cat.
I don't want a cat!|Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.
What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!|Well, I was gonna let you play with it.
Hi!|Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?
Yes I did, and I think you should do it.|What?!
He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.|You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!
I’m sorry.  If you ask me, I'd move in with him.|Ohh!! God!  Get out of here, good for nothing.
Hey Gar!|Hi, can I talk to you for a second?
Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!|Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?|It's throwing and catching!
All right.|Oh! Oh! That's so hard.
Baking it didn't help, huh?|So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?
Hey, honey! Okay, so did you find any apartments? Anything in Brooklyn Heights?|No, nothing.
Oh really?|Yeah.
Nothing at all?|No, as soon as something opens up we'll move right in. Unless it doesn't have a pool, I need a pool.
Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?|Uh-huh!
Take a seat. You okay? You feeling all right?|Yeah, I feel great. 'Cause we're moving in together.
So you uh, you checked the paper for listings in Brooklyn Heights, right? You-you checked the Post?|Yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.  Can I get some water?
In a minute. You-you checked today's Post?|Umm, yeah! Today's.
'Cause uh, this is today's Post  Brooklyn Heights!|Are these for rent! I thought people were just bragging!
Let me tell you what I think might be going on.  Okay, I think somebody asked someone to move in with them. And I think someone said, "Yes" but now she's having doubts because things are moving to fast for someone. Does that sound at all possible to you?|Yes. Yes! Fine! I am someone! You want me to say it? I have doubts!
Phoebe…|Yeah?
Phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way. I mean it is soon. And there's a lot of things we don't know about each other, and I just figure that everything I really like. And the things I don't know, I get to learn about at someplace with both our names on the mailbox.|That's so sweet.
Sweethart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you. It's fine! We don't have to move in together. I just—I want you to be happy|Living with you would make me happy.
Phoebe, you don't have to say that.|No, I really wanna live with you! I wanna move in with you!
Are you sure?|Yes. Definitely! Yes! Let's live in an apartment that we both live in!
Oh that's great!|Oh wait, one sec. One sec.  which was never!
Show cat! Quality show cat! Show cat!|Oh my God! What's wrong with your baby?!
It's not a baby! It's a cat!|Eew! It's creepy looking!
Oh no! No! It's actually—it's very sweet. It's very sweet. Look!  Yeah, do you want it?|No, I hate cats.
Well, so then what are you doing to me? Okay? Just get out of here! All right? Move on!|Wow! What an unusual cat!
Yes! Thank you! Exactly! You want it?|Maybe. I was thinking about getting a cat, I was just going to go to the shelter  but… Okay, why not?
Oh, terrific! That'll be $2,000.|What?!
Okay, a thousand.|I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.
Well, I do, but you're just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat.|Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.
I'm starving!|Come on guys! Suck it up! We're closing in on ten hours! It's gut-check time!
I'm still hungry!|All right, there's some pizza at my place, we can all eat with one hand right? Are you with me?
I am!|All right! Let's go!  All right, we can work out the name later.
Rachel! What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!|It's not! I'm defrosting a chicken.  Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson.
Wow! You made a profit!|I just came for the red-velvet pillow.
I really like waking up with you.|I like waking up with you too.  Oh, I can stay here all day.
That would be great!|We could have breakfast in bed…
Wait, just a second.|Okay.  Oh! Oh no.
All right! Come on Monica! Look alive! Come on, look alive!|Oh good, you're all up.
It's okay. It's okay. Just pretend that it didn't happen! Okay? No one needs to know! I mean, Phoebe's not an official ballplayer! I mean, only official ballplayers can drop the ball!|All right. Okay. I'm starving!
Okay! Okay, let's race! First one there wins! Ha-ha!|You guys wanna eat here?
Man that was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we threw that ball around?|Yeah, it is amazing it lasted that long.
What's going on?|Well, my eye is a little itchy.
Oh God, here we go!|What?
Anytime anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's she like freaks out. Watch! Watch!|Ross! Come on! That's all right! Fine--Okay, I have a weird thing about my eye. Can we not talk about it please?
Hey, does anybody want to get some lunch? All those in favor say I?|Ross! Stop it! Come on!
All right, I gotta go. I'm taking Ben to the park.|Ohh, give him a kiss for me!
All right, bye!|Bye!
Later!|I am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that. I didn't mean to be so out there. I am furious with him!
Oh hey Joey! What's up?|I can't decide which route to take to Vegas. Hey, you've traveled a lot right?
Yeah, I've been around.|Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}|Great! Problem solved!
But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.|Well, back to square one.
Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.|Yes!
Good, but wait. Okay, all right, here we go. Now I want you to relax. Take a deep breath. Clear your mind.  Which do you like better peanut butter or egg whites?|Peanut butter!
Which would you rather be a fireman or a swimmer?|A swimmer!
Who would you rather sleep with Monica or Rachel?|Monica. Oh… huh, I always thought it would be Rachel.
No thinking! No thinking! Tie or ascot?|Ascot!
North route or south route?|North route!
Bamn! There you go! Huh?|Wow! That was incredible! Beard of bees, here I come!
Oh, this guy again.|Hey man, what's up?
Umm, no thank you.|What's with her?
Oh my God! What does that thing do?|Oh that's an eye removal machine.
All right, I'm outta here!|I'm kidding! I'm kidding!
Hey!|I'm Dr. Miller. Monica told me you were a little nervous, but don't worry everything's gonna be just fine.
So were done then!|Almost! But first, we gotta start.
Okay.|This is a glaucoma test.
Uh-huh.|Sit down.
Okay.|But your chin here.  Now, you'll feel a small puff of air in each eye.
What?!|A small puff of air, now come on!
All right.|1…2…3!
I'm sorry. All right, I'll just stay in here this time.  Okay.|Ready?
Uh-huh.|1…2…
Okay.|That's okay.
Okay. Okay!|1…2!  Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
|Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.|Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
Great!|And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
Okay, just give me the damn drops!|Dr. Miller?  P E C F D.
Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.|They're still in my coat.
Damn!|Hey!
Bye you guys!|Bye-bye!
Oh honey, I'll say good-bye to you at the car if you don't mind the puss.|See ya!
Well, wait a minute! The puss is good! It means it's healing!|Hey Pheebs, what 'cha reading?
Man, I'm getting pretty tired. You're might have to take over soon.|We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once.
Don't worry, it's out there!  I think I just need lunch.|Yeah.
You wanna eat?  My treat!|Isn't that Ross's money?
Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?|I don't know.
Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!|Okay!
Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?|Too dry.
Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?|No!
Is this movie gonna be my big break?|No!
What?!|Yes.
Dude you said, "No!"|I also said, "Yes!"
You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?|No!  Ahhh!!!
I don't believe this!|Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.
What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!|They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.|Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.|Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
Not if you're gonna be like this!|All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!|All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
Fine!  Get out!|You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
Get out!!|All right!!  Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?|No.
Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?|No that made me feel precious.
Yeah? Sometimes it's…|Oh, did you beat him at a board game? He turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.
Okay, I'm the baby.|Eh! Stop it!
Hey!|Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
Okay.|Not even close.
Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!|Okay! All right! Let's do it!
All right!|Sit down.
All right.|Put your head back.
Yes!|All right.
Okay.|Now, open your eyes.

Monica! Stop it!|Damn! It's empty!
Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross.  Or-or Rachel!|I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
Hey, dude!|Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
Oh that's my grandma.|Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering…  Okay, I guess he ran out of change.|Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!|Really?
Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.|Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
Uh-hmm.|What do you like better flora or fauna?
Fauna.|Who would you rather be Simon or Garfunkle?
Garfunkle.|Why are you mad at me?
You said I was boring--Ohh!|When did I say you were boring?!
Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!|Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
Hey-hey! Stanley! Hey-hey! You're leading man is here! Let's get to work.|Umm, slight change of plans. We've shut down.
Wh-what?! Why?!|It's a money thing, we don't have any.
You're kidding right?|No.
What?!|It-it's probably just temporary. We're hoping to get some more money soon, so if could just uh, hang out.
Uh, hang out?! How long?|I don't know. A week? Maybe two? The money will turn up! People will always wanna invest in movies! Hey, you're not rich are ya?
No!|Eh, worth a shot.
Yeah.|These got left for ya.
Hello?|Hey Monica, it's Joey!
Hey Joey! Aww, you remembered even though you're a big star!|Aw, come on! It'll be years before I forget you!
Joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh? Do you have a dressing room? Do you have a chair with your name on it?|Uh, well yeah-yeah, I've got all of that going on. Yeah, listen uh, I want you to make sure you tell Chandler that he couldn't have been more wrong! Uh-oh! I gotta go Monica, my uh, my sushi's here!

Sucker!|Hey Joey!
Hey Pheebs! Listen, uh can you do me a favor? I forgot the pin number to my ATM card can, can you get it for me?|Sure! Where is it?
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine down on the corner.|Ohh! So you're 5639?!
Hey!|Ooh, do you want to talk to Chandler?
No!  Because he didn't believe in my movie! Which is a big mistake because it is real! Real!|Hey! Tribbiani! Get back to work! Break time's over!
Who was that?|Uhh, my stunt double. Yeah, and y'know, he's getting a little too familiar for my tastes.
Yeah!|Hey!
Well, I'm totally over it Chandler. Friends forever! Don't come out here!|Would you mind doing a picture with us?
Monica! I'm sorry I'm late!|Oh, Phoebe, I'm so sorry. Have you been here long?
It's okay. What the hell took you so long?|Okay, you can not tell Chandler. Okay? That I ran into Richard.
Which Richard?|The Richard.
Richard Simmons?! Oh my God!|Noo! My ex-boyfriend Richard! Y'know the tall guy, moustache?
Oh! Okay, that actually makes more sense. So how was it?|It was, it was really nice. We started talking and I-I ended up having lunch with him.
That is so weird! I had a dream that you'd have lunch with Richard.|Really?
But again, Simmons. Go on.|The strange part was, he was really nice, umm and he looks great, but I didn't feel anything at all!
Ooh! So now why can't we tell Chandler?|Because it would totally freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. I just don't want anything to spoil that.
Oh, I can't believe you guys lasted a whole year!|I know.
Wow! I owe Rachel 20 bucks!|What?
On a totally different bet.|Hey!
Awww! Now you're just my annoying friend Chandler.|Huh.
Okay, I'm gonna go too!|Y'know Pheebs, it's kinda our  anniversary.
Oh please, you are not gonna ditch again like you did with London.|Ditch you? Phoebe, you were pregnant with the triplets!
Uh-huh, great story! I'm going!|Hi!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey, you guys, listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to Las Vegas to surprise Joey! Including me!! You wanna go?!|Well, I guess I could take a couple days off work.
Of course you can take a couple days off work because this trip includes me!|Oh no, wait a minute, wait, I've got a presentation tomorrow. I can't miss that.
Oh yeah, so you can walk around naked.|No! So I can be by myself. Y'know? Have a little alone time.
Naked alone time.|No! Phoebe just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.
So, so far is this trip to Vegas better or worse than the trip to London?|So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
Okay, what about after I give you these candies?|Yeah, I guess it's a little better now.
Ah-ha! Okay,|Happy plane-aversary.
Oh good! All right, so you decided to tell him about the Richard thing.|What-what Richard thing?
Oh no. [The patented version.]|What Richard thing?
Simmons! Go with Simmons!|Okay, I umm, I ran into Richard yesterday and he asked me if I wanted to go for a bite and I did. The only reason I didn't tell you is because I knew you'd get mad and I didn't want to spoil our anniversary.
|Hey.
May I come in?|Uh, yeah, if you want too.
Do you want me too?|Yeah, sure?
So do I.|And um, what-what is that Ross?
The physical act of love.|What?! Are you crazy?
Oh so-so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your-your nakedness?|Oh God, you saw me?! Oh!
You weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness.|Noo!! No! You thought, you actually thought I wanted to have sex with you?!
No! No!|Ohh wow! I’m sorry, but Ross you kicked off your shoes!
Can we, can we just forget this ever happened?|Yes of course, absolutely! You're right. I'm sorry.
Thank you.|Yes.
All right I guess I'm, gonna go pack.|Okay. Oh wait! One more thing umm, do-do we still need to uh settle the question of "us?"
Hey you guys wait! Guys!  This place is so much better than London! Okay? This lady dressed like Cleopatra gave me a coupon, 99 cent steak and lobster dinner. Huh!|Phoebe, you don't eat animals.
For 99 cents, I'd eat you.  Oh! Look! Hi!|Oh my God.
Hey! Joey!|Hi!
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?|Uhh, because I'm shooting a scene right now. Yeah, I uh, I play a gladiator. Uh, y'know what? Hold-hold on a second.  Can we cut? Yeah, my-my friends are here, I'm gonna take a little break.
So you're a gladiator! Wow!|Yeah, what-what's going on?
Monica had lunch with Richard.|Dawson?!
Noo! But that would've been so cool!|No! Her boyfriend Richard!
I love Vegas!|I promise you, next time I will absolutely tell you.
Okay umm, Ross? I'm-I'm really warm, so I'm going to be taking off my sweater. Now, I'm just letting you know that this is not an invitation to the physical act of love.|Yep! That's hilarious!
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.|Y'know, last night was embarrassing for you too.
No, not really. I mean you've seen me naked hundreds of times.|Uh-huh. But it was a first for the rest of my building.
Okay. All right, that's true! But y'know I just don't embarrass that easily.|What?! You totally get embarrassed!
No, I don't! Ross, I think I'm just a more secure person than you are.|Is that so?
Yeah.|
Hey, y'know in Roman times this was more than just a hat.|Really?
Yeah, sure! Sure! They would uh, they would scrub the floors with it! They would use it to get the mud off their shoe. And sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty so they would stick it right…|Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.
All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.|Whoa!
Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!|Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick!
Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!|Good luck!
Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!|I see.
Thank you.|Thanks.
I can't believe this! This is like the worst night ever!|Y'know Monica you had a minor setback in your relationship with Chandler. Big deal! It's only Chandler.  I am so sorry.
This is crazy! I mean, it's such a stupid argument. I don't even wanna see Richard again.|So go fix it! Go find Chandler! He's probably up in your room! Tell him that you're sorry and that you love him.
Y'know what? You're right Phoebe. You're right. Thank you!|Sure!  Yeah! Las Vegas, number one!
Anybody lose this?|Comin' out. Place your bet.
|Yeah, all right. All right! Just keep walkin'! All right?
What the? What…|Hi!
|Changing one hundred!  Good luck sir.
Let's ride.|13.
Chandler! You are not gonna believe this! I have found my identical hand twin!|What?
My identical hand twin!|What's an identical hand twin?
What's it sound like? It's a guy with my identical hands! It was incredible! Chandler, the dealer's hands were exactly like me! It-it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!|Are you sure you weren't  looking at your hands in a mirror?
Don’t you see what this means?! I can forget about that stupid movie. I'm gonna be a millionaire!|How?
Look, I don't have it all worked out yet, but it's gotta mean big money! Come on! Identical hands!|Again I must go back to, how?
This is Vegas man! People will pay to see freaky stuff! Okay, how much would you pay to see this hand  twice? Huh?|Y'know, I-I can't really put a price on that Joe.
Hey, are you unsupporting me again?|No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!
Pheebs!!|Yeah?
I found my identical hand twin!|Ohh, you are so lucky!  Hey! So, where's Monica? Did you guys make up?
Enjoy your flight?|Yes, I did. Thank you very much, it was excellent.
Hope you had a nice flight.|Ohh, it was the best!
I think the check in is that way.|Ahh.
Phoebe!|You guys are here! Yay!
Hey, you wet my pants!|Whoa, what kind of party was this?
Rach! Wait! The men's room is that way.|Ugh!
What?|That's like the third time that lady's won on a machine I was playing.
Oooohhh, I'll bet she's one of those people.|M-M-Mole people?
What? No-no, a lurker.|Oh. What's a lurker?
Okay when you're playing a machine and it hasn't paid out, a lurker waits for you to give up and then…|Kills you?
No. They swoop in and steal your jackpot.|Ohhh!
Uh-hmm.|How do you know about this?
My nana used to do it. That's how she paid for all my dance—karate lessons.|Dance karate?
Yes, it's a deadly but beautiful sport.|All right, it won't come off!
What?!|It won't come off!
Oh my God! Rach-Rach, are-are-are you sure?|No, actually I took it off then I drew it back on.
Joey!!|All right! Hey-hey!
Thanks man.|Hi.
Hey listen I uh, talked to Chandler, sorry about the movie.|No, don't be sorry. I don't need it anymore. I found my identical hand twin!
Your what?|My identical hand twin! The person whose hands are exactly like mine! This thing is a gold mine!
What?! That's not gonna make you any money!|Okay. Well, if that's how you feel about it, fine! None of you get to live with me in my great big hand-shaped mansion! Except uh, you Pheebs. You can live in the thumb.
All right baby, come on!  Yes! Yes! I am on fire!|See you later Mon.
Wait Chandler, what are you doing?!|What does it look like? I'm going home.
What? Wait! Why?  Chandler! Chandler! Wait! I’m sorry, I was just playing for one second! I was trying to find you to tell you that, look if you don't want me to see Richard again, I won't! He means nothing to me!|Come on! I was there!  I know he's the love of your life.
Not any more.|Really?!
Really!  Okay, this is empty.|Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing.
Uhh, hey. Where's the other guy?|Which guy?
He's kinda tall, dark hair, hand looks exactly like this.  See?|I don't know about the hands, but the guy that was here before me just went to the bathroom.
Okay!  How you doin'?|Very busy.
Yeah, it's not coming off.|What?! What else did he say?
Umm, he said he thought I was funny. So… Okay, look-look umm, let's just go downstairs, we'll have some fun, and you will forget all about it.|Ross, no! There is no way I am leaving this room looking like this!
Oh, come on! Rach, it's-it's not that bad.|Ross, I am a human doodle!!
Okay, there was some staring and pointing.|Okay, I need a, I need a drink!
Oh, hey y'know, they-they really overcharge you for that stuff.  That is, one big drink!|Macadamia nut?
Umm… Wow! That's-that's some pricey nut!|Hm-mmm!
Really like those Macadamia nuts, huh?|Nope!
|Hey Pheebs!
Ohh! You made up!|Yeah, I couldn't be mad at him for too long.
Ohh, get a room.|We have one.
Oh-oh-oh, yeah!  That's right, you take good care of those babies!|Excuse me?
It's me, Joey!|Do I know you?
Joey!|Oh-ho, yeah. Yeah, the hand guy.
Okay, so what are we going to do about this hand twin thing?!|Nothing?
Look, you and I have been given a gift. Okay? We have to do something with it. Like-like, hand modeling! Huh? Or-or magic! And you know NASA's gonna wanna talk to us!|I have to get back to…
This hand is your hand! This hand is my hand! Oh wait, that's your hand! No wait, it's my hand!|That's okay.
Oh my God, I'm starting to look like my great aunt, Muriel.|13.
Hit me!|
I bet 20.|You're right!
Yes!|Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
That's right baby! Okay, what do I want now?|Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?
Pick a number! That is your only job!|8. 8!
Thank you!|If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!
Yes!|Yay!!
We're not really gonna buy these people steak dinners are we?|Noo!
Okay, good! Okay, what do I want now?|Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8.
What?|Two fours.
Okay.|8!:
All right, biggest suite in the place. Come on!|Yes!! I love you! I can't even remember what we were fighting about!
Oh, that's because I had lunch with Rich—Me neither! Okay, what do I want now?|Another hard 8.
Hard 8?! We should call it easy 8!|Okay, okay, I tell you what. You roll another hard eight;  and we get married here tonight.
What did you just say?|You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
Are you serious?!|Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.|Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?
Okay!|Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
Nobody move!  Okay, you look that way; I'll look this way!|All right!
That could be a four or a five. It's your call.|It's a four.
Oh well, lost again.  That's it! You and me, outside!|I don't want to see you lose a chunk of that pretty blond hair!
Be cool!  Okay lady, your lurking days are over!|What?!
Yeah, from now on everyone you lurk, I'm gonna lurk first! You move on to someone else, I'm gonna be one step ahead of you, every single time! And then I'll be on your ass every hour of every day 'til Monday, because that's when I go home. When do you leave?|Also Monday.
Hit me.|We need more cards.
Yeah, and also we need more umm, drinks. Hold on a second.  Hello! Vegas? Yeah, we would like some more alcohol, and y'know what else? We would like some more beers. Hello? Ohh, I forgot to dial!|That must be our alcohol and beers!
Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck!|Hi!
Hey!|Look-look-look you guys, I need some help! Okay? Someone is going to have to convince my hand twin to cooperate!
I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?|Ross, don't let her drink anymore!
Ohhh!!|
Oops! All right, so what do you want to do now?|I wanna get out of the room! Y'know, I…I really miss downstairs.
Well hello! I'm Ross!|Good luck to ya!
Excuse me sir, you've got a little something right here.|Wow!
Hello!|Hello!
I won! I won! I finally won!|I won! That was my quarter!
Fine! Here! Take a hike toots!|
Sells drugs to kids.|What?!
She sells drugs to kids.|It was my quarter!
How about we talk about this over dinner?|Okay lady, you're out of here.
No! No, you can't arrest me! No!! I won't go back! I won't go back to that hell hole!!|I'm just taking you outside!
Okay, come on, I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.|Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay!  Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
You're so efficient. I love you!|Let's go!
No-no-no! We need something old!|Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve.
That'll work!|I don't think so.
Okay, now we just need something borrowed!|
That's stealing!|No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
Ohh.|Okay, one thing at a time.
|Are you gonna play?
No-no, I don't really have any money. Not yet, anyway…|You can't sit here if you're not gonna play.
|Ooh, what did I do with my file-a-facts? I must've left it in conference room B.
Hit me!|Oh my God! May I just say that you two gentlemen have the exact same hands! They're identical! Now, I've never seen anything like that in the business world.
Uhh, Ms. Phalange, may I ask you a question as an impartial person at-at this table?|Please stop it!
Wouldn't you pay good money to see these identical hands showcased in some type of a uh, entertainment venue?|If you leave now, I will chop off my hand and give it too you!
Hello! One marriage please!|Yep, we wanna get married!
Dum! Dum-dum-dum! Dum! Dum! Dum! Dum-dum-dum!|What are you doing?
Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?|No, only because that's the graduation song.
Okay!  We're gonna get married!|Are you sure you wanna do this?
Oh my God!|Come on Pheebs! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!|N-No running in the chapel!
Hey!|Hey!
Yes! Well that-yes.|Why else would we be here?
We actually missed it.|Well, maybe you wouldn’t have had you  run in the chapel!
What?!|Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you’re only married in Vegas.
Ohhh!|Why are we in bed together?
I don’t know. Do-do you have any clothes on?|Yeah.
Really?!|No! But we-we didn’t have…sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don’t remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.|And we didn’t have sex.
Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I’m just glad we didn’t do anything stupid.|
Mornin’ Pheebs.  Well, my movie has officially been canceled.|Oh Joey, I’m so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
Nah, I’m too depressed to eat. I’ll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I’ll just fly home with you guys, what time’s your flight?|What about my cab?
I don’t need that anymore.|No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
I don’t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.  Oh—ooh! How about you come with me?|I don’t know, it’s such a long trip.
It’ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.|Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
Sure?|All right. Although I don’t think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
Hey.|Hey.
Where is the waitress?! I’m starving!|It’s a buffet man.
Oh, here’s where I win all my money back!|Listen, I gotta talk to you.
Sure! What’s up?|Monica and I almost got married last night.
Oh my God! That’s huge!  Wait a minute, why come I wasn’t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don’t say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."|Look, I just don’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
Oh! Tell her she’s not marriage material.|What?!
How do I tell Chandler that it’s too soon. It’s gonna break his heart, he’s not gonna think that I don’t love him anymore.|Well you don’t.
Yes I do!|Good! Good! I was just testing you.
Oh hi! Hi! Y’know, we were just talking about bacon.|No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
Rach! We weren’t gonna miss our friends getting married!|
What are you guys gonna do?|Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
So, what do you think we should do?|I don’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
I know I love you!|So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
That’s a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!|Yes, we don’t get married unless there’s a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight  then there’s a definite sign that we should get married.
All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don’t get married.|Sounds great.
Okay.|Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
Ready?|Ready!
Come on eight.|Yes, yes eight.
Wow! I can’t believe I actually rolled an eight.|That was so unlikely. Well, let’s get married! I guess.
Wait a minute. That wasn’t a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.|That’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
I wanted it so bad!  Wanna go pack?|Yeah.  We’re doing the right thing, right?
Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely.  QUESTIONS!!!|What?!
Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We’ve been on the road six hours and you’ve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!|All right. All right.
Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio’s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.|Really? I don’t…
Sing!!|
Hey!|Hey, hubby!
Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?|Uh-huh.
Okay! So, we’ll just stay married.|Yes, exactly!
And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!|Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I’d have to talk you into this more.
Okay, see now I’m scared because I don’t actually think you’re kidding.|I’m-I’m not kidding. Look I-I, I can’t have three failed marriages. I can’t. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
What-wh-what so we’ll just stay married forever?!|Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It’s right next to it!
Ohh, okay, I’m sorry. You’re right. Y’know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you’re asking of me.|I’m asking you to do me a favor.
You are asking me to be your wife!|And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.|Well you did pull his hair.
He took my snack!|I’m not getting into this again!
Okay! Oh God, y’know what? It’s really bad.|Well, I told you not to walk. Here.
This doesn’t mean anything, does it?|No!
, a rapist or a killer or something!|Don’t you think I asked him that before he got in?!
Y’know what? I’m not talking to you! You go back to sleep!  And you, are you a rapist?!|No!
Do you like car games?|Yeah, y’know the license plate game?
I love the license plate game!|Ooh, I’ll play! I’ll play!
Hey!|Hey!
Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married.  We register, and you get to keep all the presents!|No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
I don’t know if it’s true.|Oh b-b-but it is!
Oh, okay, y’know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...|Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world’s worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
All right. All right, I’ll do it.|Thank you.  Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
Wait! Wait! There is the train station!|Oh, okay.
This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.|And I have your name and the fact that you’re a drifter, so the ball’s pretty much in your court.
All right, see ya Pheebs.|Come on Pheebs! I can’t take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh?  Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
Huh, that’s funny. You look like you’re gonna be the…|No, don’t say it! Don’t even think it!
All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.|All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
Hey!|Hey, so did everything go all right with the annulment?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.|Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh yeah, why not?|Pheebs?
Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?|Always.
I didn’t get the annulment.|What?!
What are you doing?|The key’s stuck in the lock.
I can fix it. Hold on.|It still doesn’t work.
I’m not finished.|Oh.
Hey!|Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
Oh, yeah, no problems. It’s all taken care of.|Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
Oh yeah, why not?|Okay, umm, I’m gonna get my sweater.
Okay.  You uh, you wanna hear something weird?|Always.
I didn’t get the annulment.|What?!
Hey, do you have any gum?|Oh? Yeah! Sure!
I know.|Ross?!
Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer’s office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don’t want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.|Don’t be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y’know? Mine’s gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
Look, all I know is I-I can’t have another failed marriage!|So okay what? You’re gonna be married to a girl who doesn’t even know about it?!—Op, woman! Sorry.
Well, okay so, I don’t have it all worked out quite yet. Just don’t say anything to Rachel, please?|Rachel is one of my closest friends.  Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
Y’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?|Of course! Joey wouldn’t let you have one?
No. When it comes to sweets, he’s surprisingly strict.|Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you’re moving out?
No, no, I keep trying, y’know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too…" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "…go to the bathroom." He may think I’m sick.|Y’know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I… We just have to get it over with! Y’know, the next time we see them we’re just gonna tell them. Okay? That’s it.
Oh, so that’s this is gonna work now? You’re just gonna order me around all the time?|Pretty much.
All right.|Hey Monica!
No-o-o!  No-o-o! Look Joey, here’s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I’m gonna be moving out man.|Wow!
Look, I-I’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I’m moving right back in with you!|
Hey Pheebs!|Hey!
Hey, have you seen Rachel?|No, why?
I have some pretty exciting news!|You’re pregnant!
No! Chandler and I are moving in together!|Ooh! That’s good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.
Hey!|What’s up?
Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.|Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend…shaking up. Oh, that’s great. That’s great.
Okay, come here!|Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled…
Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn’t seem so bad?|Bye.
Hey!|Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
What gave me away?|I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she’s the only one left!
Okay, so that’s it, everybody knows! It’s official, we’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?|No.
Wow that was my scariest voice! You’re very brave.|Hey!
Hey.|Ugh, the worse day! Y’know, you think you’re making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap.  Seriously.|I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
Well, I-I still think you’re very-very nice and very pretty…|What?
|Have a seat.  Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
Rach…|Yeah, he’s gonna work on that.
…once you know the stories, it’s not that bad. First marriage, wife’s hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn’t allow you to get married when you’re that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada’s fault.|Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn’t be interested? Who wouldn’t want to date him?
What?!|
This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?|Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
We were drunk! I would’ve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!|Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
Look, I’m sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don’t want to be divorced three times.|Yes, and now he’s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
—Nothing!!|Okay now I wouldn’t date you because you seem a little creepy.
Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?|Soon! I-I just couldn’t before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn’t do that to her, she’s my best friend!
Well, Joey’s my best friend.|I’m not your best friend?
You just said… Of course you’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?|All right, all right, at least I’m prepared.
Okay.|Hey!
Hey-hey!|These aren’t for you! Are you upset?
I am now!|Hey roomie!
Okay, bye!|Rach, there’s something uh, important I have to tell you.
God, it’s gonna so weird like when I come home and you’re not here. Y’know? No more Joey and Chan’s. No more J and C’s. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler’s?" "Can’t, its not there."|Look, I’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
Yeah but we won’t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.|Not once did we do that.
Hi.|So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It’s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie’s!!|Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
You got married again.|Yes.
So that’s your second marriage in two years.|Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don’t you tell me what happened.|Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk…
I’m sorry, is this the same Rachel who’s name you said at the altar in the second marriage?|Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
Oh, that’s better then.|This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
I see. Have you considered therapy?|I think just the annulment for today.
There are a couple of forms to fill out.|Easy.
And we’ll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.|No problem.
And we’ll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.|Ooh! There’s no way to do this without her? ‘Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
Of course you did. Look Ross, you can’t get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.|Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel?  I will think about the therapy.
Hey!|Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
Okay!|Y’know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
Okay.|Hey Rach, what about this?  Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don’t know if I want it because it might be y’know, too many memories!
What the hell is that?|I don’t know.  Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!|Something to remember me by!
Mon, honey you’re not dying. I’m just moving out. Y’know, I mean we’re gonna see each other all the time.|But still, it’s a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
Are you okay? You’re not blinking.|I’m fine! I just, I’m thinking how much it’s an end of era.
Oh, all right. But y’know I gotta say, I don’t, I don’t think six years counts as an era.|An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn’t significant to you!
What is the matter with you?!|What is the matter with you?!! Why aren’t you more upset?! Aren’t you gonna be sad that we’re not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren’t you gonna miss me at all?!
All right, fine, but don’t get mad at me. It’s-it’s just a little hard to believe.|What’s hard to believe?
Well y’know, it’s you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y’know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I’m not upset because I don’t see you guys going through with it. I’m sorry.|Rachel, it’s going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
But I…|No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn’t something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
It is? Really?|Yeah, sweetie.
I mean we’re not, we’re not gonna live together anymore?|No.
What? Oh my God! I’m gonna miss you so much!|I’m gonna miss you!
I mean it’s the end of an era!|I know!
Okay, bye!|Oh no.
So? Did you get the annulment?|I couldn’t.
I knew it! Because you love Rachel.|It’s not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I…
Yeah, complicated ‘cause of the love.|I… I do, I do not love Rachel. I’m gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
I’ve never been more convinced of your love for her.|I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
Ohh, what’s wrong?!|Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
Oh my—Come here! Come here!  It’s okay. Everything’s gonna be okay.|Thank you.
So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?|Oh we do, but not just yet.
Really?! Well, when?|Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won’t work out.
Wow.|I know. Then, I’m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you’ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
Great!|But then we ditch those two and that’s when we get married. We’ll have Chandler’s money and Rachel’s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel’s drinking problem.
Oh-oh, what about Ross?|I don’t want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
Hey!|Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Pheebs, I don’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?|Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!
Hey.|Hey!
So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?|Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.
You didn’t tell her did you?|No.
Of course not, because you’re in love with her.|I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn’t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.
What do you mean, comforted her?|It’s nothing, I just gave her a hug.
Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!|It’s also a sign of friendship.
Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.|It was a hug!
Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?|S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?
Ninety percent of a women’s pheromones come out the top of her head! That’s why, that’s why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them!  Oh come on Ross, you’re a scientist.|I was hugging her as a friend. It’s not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she’s got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh…coconutty.  What?! Oh, that doesn’t mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel’s not in the same place you are.|If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!
Hey!  Dude, some guy just called for you.|Who was it?
I don’t know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez!|Okay listen, y’know when you move in Rachel’s room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?
Hey, what’s up?|Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.
But you’re still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.|"Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!
Pheebs, I have to ask you…|Shhhhhh! I’m swamped right now.
You’re just staring into space.|Umm, I’m trying to move that pencil.
This one?|It worked!
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this;  "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." It’s just, there is nothing! The city’s full!|Wait, no, look at this!  "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay…" Oh, yeah, but it’s on the ground floor.
Hey.|Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?
Yeah! Why?|Okay, there’s this guy, Warren, from the museum and he’s going on a dig for like two years and he’s got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?
That sounds great! I’d love to live at Warren’s!! I love Warren! Thank you!|Don’t thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization.  Here’s Warren’s number.
Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now!  Oh, thank you!|Okay, you go grab it!
Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I’m never gonna find anything.|You can live with me.
What?!|What?!
Oh my God! Are you serious?!|Uh-huh.
I would love to live with you Ross; that’s-that’s great! Thank you!|Well, I’m-I’m just glad I could, y’know, help you out.
Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You’re my hero!|Hero, I uh, I don’t know—well, all right.
Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!|Oh please!  You’re gonna say things now, aren’t ya?
Hi.|Hi.
Hi, listen, I’m sorry about before. I don’t need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn’t get girls, and now I can ‘em—Now, I have you.  Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women…|Stop it Chandler.  I’m sorry too.
Really?|Yeah! Oh yes!
Ohh.|Listen, we don’t have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.
That’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.|Totally!
We don’t have to come up with this now.|Oh good.
Hey, y’know what? Why don’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?|Changes?
Yeah, I mean we’re gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.|You’re-you’re-you’re gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?
Is that a problem?|Well, it’s a set and they should probably stay together.
Oh, that’s cool. Then I’ll just bring them both over.|See now-now you’re taking them away from their home.
Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!|Yeah-yeah, y’know what? Yeah, that’s it-that’s it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That’s-that’s what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I’m talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn’t match! Where is it gonna go?!
In the game room!|Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!
Everything on your application looks really good—Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?|Oh don’t worry, I’m not really a party girl.
Whoa!! Now look, don’t be just blurtin’ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?|
Oh don’t listen to him, he’s just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don’t think he’s gonna get it.|Why did you take the shower curtain down?
Hey!|Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.|What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.|What?! Over a stupid room!
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!|Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!
What’s all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!|Ross, we can handle this.
Well, apparently not, and I can’t just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!|Well, why don’t you tell her to stop being silly!
Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I’ve known you both a long time, and I’ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you’ve been since you’ve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?|Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.
Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?|Yeah, I do.
And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don’t ya?|Yes.
So I understand you’re looking for a place.|No-no, I’m staying put.
Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.|Why, where are you going?
I don’t know.|Hey Rach!
So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it’s a really big step! And-and what’s the rush?!|That’s very funny!
No, I-I-I’m serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y’know you break up!|Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.
Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn’t about the room, this is about what the room…represents! And unfortunately, this room  could destroy you!!|Yeah, I'm not so worried.
Fine! It’s your life!|You still want to move in together right?
Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.|So umm, where are the other guys?
Yes.|Here she comes. Hold on, I’m gonna make your life much easier.
Hi!|Hi!
Come in. Thanks for comin’ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!|Great!
Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, I’m gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.|I can do that.
Okay! Here we go. Pillow.|Fight.
Very good! Okay. G.|String?
Excellent! Okay umm, doggy.|Kitten?
So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?|This bottle opener.
And?|And it’s a magnet!
Look at that!|How weird is that? Y’know? You’re moving in with me and have the one thing I don’t have. It’s like uh, in a way you-you complete me  kitchen.
What?!|You complete me kitchen, matey!
Hey Rach, aren’t these candlesticks  mine?|No-no, I bought those.
Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.|Yeah.
|Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!
Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?|Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.
Hey!|Hi.
Oh, what’s the matter?|Well, you know that psychic I see?
Yeah?|Well, she told me that I’m gonna die this week, so I’m kinda bummed about that.
What?!|Yeah, and I know you guys don’t know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.
Just out of curiosity did she tell you how you’re gonna go?|No, ‘cause she didn’t tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean I’ve only got a week left, y’know? I’ve really gotta start living now!
Oh hi!|Hey uh, well, today’s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?
Why don’t you open with a joke?|Open with a joke? It’s a university, not a comedy club!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not talking about Chuckles University?!|Okay!
Hey.|Hey! Any good mail?
Yes, you got something from the Screen Actor’s Guild.|Ooh, it’s probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, I’m kinda….
"Benefits lapsed."|Hmm that’s weird. I don’t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.
Okay, it’s not a check. They’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didn’t work enough last year.|Let me see that!
All right.|Oh, I can’t believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, y’know? And it wouldn’t matter. Now I gotta be careful?!
I’m sorry man, there’s never a good time to  stop catching on fire.|All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. I’m gonna go see my agent.
Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.|
Hey!|Hey Pheebs, you’re still alive! How are you doing?
Ugh, it’s so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you could—|Pheebs, what-what are you doing?
I was preparing you for my—didn’t you think I was dead? Did that not come off?|Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought we’d lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?
Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, y’know if you can.|Monica!
Hey Estelle, listen…|Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!
What are you talkin’ about? I never left you! You’ve always been my agent!|Really?!
Yeah!|Oh well, no harm, no foul.
Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.|All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.
Why?|Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.
Hey!|Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and I’ll have my health insurance back in no time.
That’s great, but shouldn’t you be on the toilet right now?|What?!
What’s wrong with you?|Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you go to the doctor!|No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!
That’s a hernia.|Why did I have to start working out again?  Damn you 15s!
Well, we’re a little early, the lecture doesn’t end for 15 minutes.|Yeah, but y’know we could sneak in and watch.
Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! There’s some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa.  Wow, we really are bitches.|Oh bloody hell.
What the hell are you doing?!|Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.
|What are you doing?
Top ‘O the morning to ya laddies!|Just please stop!
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?  Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!|Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides it’s getting darker and more painful, that means it’s healing.
I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and let’s just get that thing…pushed back in.|Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don’t want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I’m thinking I’ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.
Hey.|Hey!
Oh Joey’s got a really bad hernia, but that’s nothing a little laser eye surgery won’t fix!|Look, I’m telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn’t hurt that bad.
Gimme ‘em!|No! They are mine!
You stole them from me!|You stole them from me!!
You just wanna each take one?|Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.
Why don’t you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think you’re, y’know, that you’re adjusting to life in America.|Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean they’re probably not even listening!
Whenever you’re ready.|Okay. "Hey, Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you."
Hold it. I’m sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little less…intense?|Oh yeah, sure, no problem, I’ll just—hold on one second.  "Hey Timmy, I’ve got a surprise for you!"
So that’s why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today!|That’s where you pick up the bag.
Exactly.|No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.
Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today.  I didn’t get it, did I?|No.
Hi. I’m Joey Tribbiani; I’m here to audition for  man.|You mean dying man?
Okay, come on, do it one more time!|Really? Really?!
Yes!|Okay!
Listen, I’m really glad you got the part.|Thank you.
But are you sure you can do this?|Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.
Now, is that never talking about it again?!|Hiya!
Take 36 is up!|All right! Let’s try this again! You ready Joe?
Hello?|Hello, is Ross there?
Uh no, he’s not. Can I take a message?|Yes, this Russell, Ross’s divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I haven’t heard from him, I assume he’s decided to give the marriage a try.
|What’s happening to your accent?
All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because I’m-I’m hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression…|Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!
Have you really done this before?|Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, don’t hold back.
Hey!|Hey-hey-hey!
We’re just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.|Oh, all right.
I cannot believe that you didn’t tell me that we are still married!!|Look I was going to tell you!
When?! After the birth of our first secret child?!  Ross didn’t get the annulment; we are still married.|What?
Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys.  Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcriber’s note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche, I’d have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther, these yours?|Yeah, that’s what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!
Na-uh!  Hey did anybody lose their keys?|Joey, why don’t you put them in the lost and found?
There’s a lost and found?|You left a shoe here?!
Well, I didn’t realize until I got home. I wasn’t gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Y’know what? I’m gonna go find that guy’s car and leave a note on the windshield.|Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I’ll be sure to give him your shoe.
Great! Thanks.|Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!
Nice car!|Yeah, it’s not mine.
So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Ross’s, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.|What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I don’t have a roommate.
Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.|Maybe you could be my roommate!
Well there’s an idea!!|Yeah!
That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?|Umm, she said she’d be back December 26th.
Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.|Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. I’ll take care of everything.
Well sure, if you say you’re gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms!  All right, now I’m gonna do this my way and I don’t want to hear a peep out of you!|Okay Rach, but…
Ross! Y’know what, I just got—why? Why did you do this?!|Look I told you…
I don’t wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"|Look, if you’d had two failed marriages, you’d understand!
Well, y’know what? Thanks to you I’m half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I don’t think I have ever been this angry!|What about the time I said we were on a break?
Pheebs, how’s it going?|I’m doing okay. I think it’s going well. Do you think they’re having fun? Am I talking to fast?
Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, it’s going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.|Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben.
What do you mean?|I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And y’know Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around…
This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.|Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.
Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.|You don’t even have a car!
I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.|And?
And six others.|There you are.
Yeah, she tops out at 130.|Wow!
And that’s just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.|Really! You got a place upstate?
Sure!|Well, I’ll see you later.
Okay, take it easy.|Hey! That’s my car.
Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.|What-what are you doing?
Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now I’m just polishing her up.|But it’s my car!
Yeah, but it’s my wax.|Listen, I-I-I don’t come to this city much so I don’t know if you’re crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.
Sure. Here.  I’ll uh, save your parking spot.|I’m not coming back.
Why not?|I live upstate.
I don’t know why I was so nervous about this. And I don’t know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.|Yeah, two hours, a lifetime that’s the same.
No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, that’s just gonna mess them up.|They’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!
What?!|Glass, sand, whatever.
Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.|Oh it’s so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.
Oh, I can still do that.|How are you still single?!
How did that happen?!!|Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Y’know? And it turns out I was wrong. And now it’s lodged in my throat.
Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?|Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.
So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.|Fine, I’m mentally unstable.
And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.|What?!
Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?|Oh, come on!
And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin.|Okay, I’m sorry, this is insane! I-I-I’m not addicted to heroin, I’m not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, I’ll consummate this marriage right here, right now!
That won’t be necessary.|And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!
Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.|Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago!  And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?
Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?|Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.
Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly don’t qualify for an annulment. If you two don’t want to be together you’ll have to file for divorce.|That’s great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!
You need to get out of my chambers.|All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!
Would you like to spend the night in jail?|And thank you for your time.
So the Porsche guy took his car back.|But you found the keys to his clothes?
No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.|And people will think you own a Porsche because you’re wearing the clothes?
Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn’t have the car! Right?|That is true.
Oh, I’ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche.|Joey, you know you don’t actually have one.
Come on! What are you doing?! I’m in character! Would you talk to her!|Ahh, I think it just moved. It’s really poking me.
Why isn’t that valet back with my Porsche?|Maybe because you’ve got the keys?
Porsche.|This is totally your fault!
Hi! How are the Gellers?|Don’t call us that!
Hey!|How do you feel?
Well, let’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.|Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed ‘em, bathed ‘em, and put ‘em to bed.
And protected them from a tornado?|Oh my God.
Was the setting of Phoebe’s triumph.|But the mess!
Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.|You’re right, you’re right I shouldn’t freak out. ‘Cause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!
Oh honey thank God you’re home, I was getting worried.|I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, I’ve already signed everything and I put little ‘X’s where you need to sign.
Oh, little ‘X’s! Great! That makes up for everything!|Y’know, I-I—you’ve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?
Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!|Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!
Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!|Yeah! Right!
Nothing.|Okay, can we just sign please?
Uh-hmm.|Congratulations.
Okay Ross, we’re—wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.|What?
Well, y’know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.|Excuse me?
Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?|Yeah?
And uh, yeah, I didn’t really, I didn’t want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then  to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.|So then if-if—I mean if you think about it, this is all  your fault.
Yeah, don’t push it though.|I’ve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.
I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn’t be a secret, and we wouldn’t have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.|Did I, did I even treat?
No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.|That may be the most depressing thing I’ve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer’s office.
Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.|Eh, no problem.
I’m gonna need a copy of those.|Totally.
Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!|Hi Joey.
Hey! How you doin’?|He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Listen, I’m gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.|Right! And when is that due?
First of the month.|And that’s every month?
No, just the months you actually want to live here.|Ahhh.
Okay, here is the phone bill.|Oh my God!!
That’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don’t I just—why don’t I just cover you for a while?|No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity…anymore.
It’s not charity, Joe…|No! Forget it! Okay—I mean thanks, but I’m done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what’s next? Come on.
Okay uh, here’s the electric bill.|This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?|No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn’t take it.
Well, how much do you think he needs?|I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won’t hurt his pride.
Why don’t you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.|Well that would help the pride thing.
And also, my birthday.|It’s not your birthday.
What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it’s not your birthday!|Hey!
Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?|Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we’d do nothing.
Oh my God! Monica’s just gonna kill you.|Yeah, yeah, I know.
Well, what you’re wearing is fine for that.|Rachel, I need to borrow—You’re not packed!!!! You’re not packed even a little bit!
I have plans.|You’re plans were with us.
That’s right.|All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
Okay.|Okay!  Oh my God, thank you!!
Hurry! Monica’s gonna make you pack! She’s got jobs for everyone! Now, it’s too late for me, but save your selves!|Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we’re gonna start with…
Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.|Oh, I wish I’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
Oh that’s okay. Hey, actually in a way it’s kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!|Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
What, are you crazy? You haven’t beaten me once since my injury plagued ’97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.|Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
Okay, you’re on.|Okay, let’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
Ohhhhhh, look it’s the roller blades.|Oh God!
You remember when we got these?|No.
I guess you weren’t there.|You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time…  You don’t remember?
I’m sorry Pheebs, I guess I’m just really said that I’m leaving.|I’m gonna miss you so much.
I have one.|Good! Great! You can go first.
Uh well, I guess I’m not gonna miss the fact that you’re never allowed to move the phone pen.|Good that’s a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y’know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
You get your messages!|Yeah, well I don’t think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?|Great! It worked! No one’s sad.
I gotta buy some food.|Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
You serious?|Oh yes!
Okay, get ready to owe me!|Okay.
Hello?  See? Other people call me!|Ooh, your brother. Score!
What’s up?|Oh, I’m just over here with Ben. I thought we’d say hi.
Oh, put him on!|Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica.  Oh, I guess he doesn’t feel like talking right now. He’s smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?|You know what else I’m not gonna miss? "I’m Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
Hey! I call her!|"Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
Still broken?|This sucks man! The last night you’re here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?|Nah, not my game.
Okay, uh, how about, how about—y’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it’s fun.|Well, what’s it called?
Cups.|I don’t know how to play Cups.
I’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, it’s really easy and really, really fun.|All right.
Okay, here you go.  I have two queens, what do you have?|A two and a five.
Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!|Really?!
Oh yeah! Okay, let’s play again.  What do you got?|A four and a nine.
You’re kidding right?|No. Why?
Well that’s a full cup!|Damn! I am good at Cups!
I’m not talking to her!|Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she’s the one who’s leaving. It’s harder for her!
Well, maybe you’re right—She made fun of my phone pen!|I know, I took it hard too.
Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about—What are you doing?|I’m unpacking!
What?!|I’m not moving!  Is that picture straight?
It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!|Hey, y’know what? You’re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
Because it’s my apartment!|Well it’s mine too! What else you got?!
How about, you’re moving!!|Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
I am not!|Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
No Phoebe I am mad!|Well, deep-deep-deep down!
You win.|Well, what did you have?
It doesn’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?|Uh,  wow, 700.
Not 700 exactly?|Yeah.
Double it!|What?
Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.|Really?
Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I’m just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"|Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y’know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y’know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.|Oh really? Like what Monica?
Y’know she has 147,000 pairs of boots…|Oh yeah, good start Mon.
She lets you borrow them.|Yeah and you stretch ‘em out with your big old clown feet.
Do you wanna live outside?! Because it’s gettin’ cold!  She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she’ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I’d like.|What else?
When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.|Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.|Well y’know, I don’t want you to be cold.
And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive.|Oh, it’s gonna be fine.
Hey!|What’s wrong?
Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!|Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin’ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn’t even get half a cup! Nothin’!!|Oh man!!
And he never played before either! Y’know what I think? I think beginner’s luck, very important in Cups.|All right, let’s play one more hand! One more!
No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I’m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there’s a—I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money.  Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y’know, thank you for being such a great roommate.|I can’t take the big white dog! You love it!
It’s him, not it!|No, but wait—what if I bought it from you, y’know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?
Wait a second, I see what you’re trying to do here! You-you’re trying to give me money again!|When did I try to give you money?
Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!|I’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you’re okay.
Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?|Okay.
I’m really gonna miss you.|Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
Thanks.|Yeah.
Yeah.|Bye house!
Bye.|Hey.
She really left.|I know.
Thank you.|No problem roomie.
Can I ask you a question?|Sure!
I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.|And now you want that money back.
Exactly.|Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
It’s not a real game! I made it up!|I’m sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
At a fake game!!|Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I’d be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.|No.
Ready?|Yeah.
Okay.|Hi...
it's...|Rachel...
and…|Phoebe’s...
please...|leave...
leave…|Wait, I-I just said "leave."
Yeah, I know because you have all the good words. What do I get? I get "it’s," "and" oh I'm sorry, I have "A." Forget it.|Phoebe, come on that's silly.
All right, so let's switch.|No, I have all of the good words. OK, fine, fine, we can switch.
Okay.|Okay.
Hi…|Everybody…
It's…|Rachel…
and…|Phoebe’s…
Please...wait, how did you do that?|What?
Oh, you're no ordinary roommate are you?|Phoebe, come on can we finish this later? Cause I wanna go running before it gets dark. Oh! Why don't you come with me?!
Really?|Yeah, it'll be fun. We'll run in the park. It'll be like our first y’know roommate bonding thing.
Okay, let's go running!|Yeah and there's really cute guys there.
Let's run towards them!|OK!
All right, wait just one more second. Hi, it's Phoebe and Rachel's. Please leave a message, thanks!|Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.|And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
Hey!|Hey!
Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!|I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
Oh, So you can move them!|Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!|Hi.
Yeah, she's gonna live with me!|It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!|So, uh, wh-where ya from?
From the land down under? I didn't know that either!|So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!|Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
Oh, hey let me.|Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
Of course I did.|Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
"When can you move in?"|Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!|Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
Oh God, yeah.|Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
Okay!|No-no
Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!|Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.|Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.|Okay.
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.|Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
Oh! I used to do that too!|Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
Aw, Mon...|So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.|Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
Hey!|Hey!
Why? Why would you do that?|I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man.|I Gotcha!!
Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.|Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica’s gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?|I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?|Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it.  How you doin?
Ohhhh man|Sorry, there's just more room out here.
No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.|Why don't you try to do-
|What's wrong?
Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower.  Oh my God!|Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.|No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.|No, wait Phoebe.
Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what ‘cha doin?|What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?|Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
Put it back exactly where you found it?|Yes I'm gonna put it back  exactly where I found it.
‘Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.|She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?|She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.|I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak…out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.|No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now.  Phone's done ehh.
We should start with the big stuff. Y’know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch.|Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.|Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.|Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!|Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?|Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.|Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
That's not specific to girls.|This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.|They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.|I'm never gonna find love again.
Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?|Sure
Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.|So, what should you have done?
Well, I-I should've told you the truth.|Uh-Huh, Which is...?
Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...|So?
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.|Why do you care?
Because they're people.|But people that you don't know and will never see again.
Yes, but still. They're people…with eyes.|Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
I-I am not uptight—Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.|That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn’t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan?  The neighbor's dog.
Okay, is this lamp in the same place?|Who cares? I repel women.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.|What?!
I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.|Why does anyone have to be naked?
Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.|Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
Bye! Thank God|Dude, what'd you have?
Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.|The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
That's perfect! That's brilliant!|So really, what'd ya have?
Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.|Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?|Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
Is there something wrong?|All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
Joey...|No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.|Oh!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.|Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.|Oh, I do.  How you doin?
I'm OK|What?!?!
What?|Oh dear God!
Hey!|Hey!
Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!|See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
Is it okay for me to come in now?|Uh-huh
Why is everything different?|Bye!
Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.|Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?|Do you want me to be afraid of you?
Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.|Really?
Of course!|Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...|...and live forever as a machine!
That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.|Yeah, I gotta go.
Hey.|Hi, my name’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
Sure, neighbor come on in.|So, is Janine around?
Uh, no, she’s at dance class.|Can I check out what she did to my room?
Yeah, but, hey look, don’t go through her stuff. She gets really mad.|It’s spreading already.
It is???|Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
No.|Is that your tiny little box, that’s too small to put anything in?
All right, you’re right. I’ll talk to her.|Yes talk to her. Be a man.
I’m a man.|Defend yourself.
|Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
Hey guys.|Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
It was okay. She’s still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.|Ohh, yeah.
Yeah.|The one that always stares at me when I come in?
No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.|Still I could tell. She was into me.  Well, why don’t you set us up?
I don’t think mine likes me either.|Maybe it’s a universal thing?
Thank you.|Sure.
Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.|Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.|What? What!?! You kissed him?
Totally.|Phoebe are you serious?
Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we’re making out. You know.|Phoebe, I mean, you do know he’s married?
No!|Phoebe…
Hey Joey.|Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
No, I just thought it was cute.|Yeah, that’s what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh…Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It’s…too girly.
Ohh. Like what?|Like this.  Pictures of cute babies we don’t know. We..we can’t have that.
Joey, it’s Anne Geddes. She’s a famous artist.|Look I don’t know this baby. I don’t know if she’s a famous artist or not. You know, and I don’t want to be a jerk but you’re changing too much around here.
Well, I’m sorry. I just thought I’d try to make the place a little nicer.|Yeah but it’s too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
Well I just thought…|I’m sure it’s a famous watering can, okay. But, come on…and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
It’s a curling iron.|Ohh, well, that’s ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It’s up here on some hook..and…smells different.
It’s clean.|Yeah, well, it feels different.
It’s dry.|Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels…Also what is with these chips you bought?
No no no no, it’s potpourri. You’re supposed to smell it.|Well that’s like summer in a bowl.
Oh, Kim, Hi.|Uhh-huh.
So you know, I…I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.|I didn’t read it.
Ahh….So…Wow…The spring line, it’s really going to be great this year, huh?|Yeah.
So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.|Tell me everything.
Hey guys.|Hey.
What’s up?|You know…Oh My God.
I whitened them.|Really.
Yeah. What do you think.|Well, I think I shouldn’t look directly at them.
Come on, seriously.|Ross they’re really, really, really white.
Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.|How much longer?
A-A day.|Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
I know. That’s why I did it.  Come on, are they really that bad?|No, no no no. You’ll be fine.  Hillary’s bind, right?
Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh…|Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside.  You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
Nope. Okay, colors that don’t work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.|I don’t know what I’m going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn’t look so bright.|Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
I’m just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.|Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We’re not 13 anymore.
Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.|But, won’t she notice I have makeup on?
Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.|What??
All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.|No. I am not putting on makeup.
Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn’t waste these pantyhose.|Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I’m going to go over to Joey’s.
Wait, we’re supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.|Yes, but I feel like I’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You’re right, I’m sorry.|Nah, Nah, it’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
Yeah. Go over to Joey’s. Go over to Joey’s and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.|You know when guys hang out they don’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
Hey Chandler. Come on in. We’re knitting pot holders.|No thanks, Josephine.
Ohh, hi, Kim.|Hi Rachel.
Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn’t happen.|You didn’t cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
Okay, two things didn’t happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that’s not true.|That’s not true?
No.|Oh that’s interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.|Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
I-I don’t want your job. I-I don’t. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don’t even know how to use my keycard.|Hi Ralph.
And after that, what could I do except become a chef.|Mmm-Hmm.
And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.|Mmm.
You know, you’re a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.|Mm-Hmm.
After a while it’s like, shut your mouth, you know?|Hmm-Hmm.
I’ve probably been talking too much. Why don’t we talk about you a little bit?|Mmm-Unmm.
Come on. I want to know.|Hmm-Hmm-Hmm.  Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let’s talk more about you. Hmm.
So what’s really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.|Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
Ohh, I love birds.|What is the matter with you ?!?
What?|You’re arranging flowers!  You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they’re just, you know, they’re nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.|You’re turning into a women.
No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.|Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?
Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.|But why didn’t you just tell her the truth.
I did but she doesn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.|Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
You were with Kenny today, weren’t you?|Just for a second.
Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?|Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I’m not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn’t.|Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
That wouldn’t help me.|Ohh, yes it would.
I’ve had a really good time tonight.|Mmm.
You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.|
Are you going to eat that bread?|Mmmm.
You make me laugh.|Hmm-Hmm.
Would you like to move over to the couch?|Mmm-Hmm.
Maybe I’ll just turn the lights down a little.|How about all the way.
Okay.|So, ahh, where were we?
Are those your teeth??|Ohh, you can see them, huh?
Yes. They’re insanely white.|I-I, did that for you.
What’s a matter with you?|What’s a matter with me? You’ve got a black light. It’s 1999!
Kim, hi.|Hi Rachel. Ohh, I’ve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
Okay..Okay.. Look. I’m sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.|Oh, really?
Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can’t do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can’t do this. I’m married and I’m sorry." And then I don’t know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."|You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
Of course it’s true and it hurts so bad.|Ohh honey come here.  Ohh it will be ok. We’ve all been there.
You and Ralph?|Kenny the copyboy.
Hey.|Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
What’s the matter? Are you upset?|I’m sorry but we’ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That’s just the way it has to be.
Well, if that’s what you want. I’ll just put it all in my room.|Great…Great…and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn’t want to make a big deal out of this, you know.  You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
Okay.|And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
Sure.|And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?|Okay.
So guess who’s coming to Thanksgiving dinner?|Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
No, my parents.|Oh! That’s great, they haven’t seen the place since I moved in!
Why can’t I tell them that we live together?|Because they don’t know we’re dating.
Why haven’t you told them?!|Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn’t.
Why haven’t you told them?! Wouldn’t they be happy?!|
Why wouldn’t they be happy?|Well, um, because mainly, um, they don’t like you. I’m sorry.
What? What? Why?!|Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you’re really sarcastic, or that, y’know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
Is this why they don’t like me or why you don’t like me?|Look, I know that I should’ve told them. I know I shouldn’t care what they think. I’m sorry.
Y’know, it’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we’ll tell ‘em.|You really think that’ll work?
Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn’t I?|I don’t think you’ll ever get my parents that drunk!
Yes, of course they like you!|Well Monica just told me that they don’t.
Yeah, they don’t like you.|Do you know why?
I dunno, maybe it’s because you’re really sarcastic. Or maybe it’s cause you uh-|Well if people don’t know they shouldn’t just guess!
This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.|Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin’ up, eh?
Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.|Well maybe I love ya’.
Hey.|Hey.
No I don’t want to play video games, Joey!|Are you guys going to Chandler’s for Thanksgiving?
For real?|No, but you should go to Chandler’s. Because none of us knows how to cook, we’ll probably just end up drinking all day.
Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it’s my sister. But, uh, uh y’know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.|Okay.
Hey!|Hey!
Nothing.|Nothing?
No, sweetie, I-I trust you.|So, if-if I mess this up, there’s nothing else for dessert?
You’re not gonna mess it up.|Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter’s done?
Hey!|Hey!
Whoa whoa whoa! Where’re you goin’?|Oh, oh, we did say we’d stop by this little thing Joey’s roommate is having.
Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?|Some would say she’s attractive, yes.
You’re not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you’re gonna eat here!|Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
Hello everybody!|Hi!
Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is it’s Chandler!|Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
Whoa, snowing out there?|No.
Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.|My joke wasn’t funny.
Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.|Really?!
Y’know dad, Chandler is one of Ross’s very best friends!|Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y’know I’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
Rach, you’re killin’ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!|Look at it, isn’t it beautiful?
W-What was the one right before bananas?|The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y’know, I thought “well, there’s mincemeat pie,” I mean that’s an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y’know. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!|Chandler!
Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd’s Pie!|Oh man! Now she’s gonna start all over! We’re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
No, no, we will. We just won’t tell her she messed up.|Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
Yeah, it’ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!|Vomiting stories are funny...
Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!|Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
No!|Still not hot enough!
Rachel?|Yeah?
Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.|Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
What?|Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
Okay, I think I might know why my parents don’t like you.|You do? Why?
Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.|What?! Why did you do that?
I don’t know, aheh, your’s was the first name that-that popped into my head, I’m I’m sorry. I-I didn’t think it would matter.|How could it not matter?!
How was I supposed to know we’d end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?|What about all that “friends forever” stuff?
Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get Ross stoned!|Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
Ross, I can’t believe you’d do that!|The reason we haven’t told them we’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
You! It’s not like it’s a big deal! You-you don’t still do it or anything!|Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
Dad, please don’t pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you’re gonna put your feet up, why don’t you sit on the-|Monica, leave him alone!
Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine’s friends are dancers?! And that they’re going to be drinking alot!?|No, I did, but tell me again, because it’s so romantic.
Well you’re whippin’ so slow! Can’t you do it any faster?|Joey! Come on! I don’t wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”
So why don’t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?|Oh I am!
Ross, if you don’t tell them, then I will!|Okay, fine!
Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?|Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can’t? Okay.
Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.|What?! What is with everybody? It’s Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they’re all gonna’ make fun of her, do you want that?|Okay, okay, we’ll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?|Okay...
What’s up, Ross?|So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
Yeah!|And um...You look nice today.
Oh no. No Ross, don’t do this.|What?
I just- I don’t think us getting back together is a good idea.|Eh?
I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y’know? And it’s probably really hard for you to be alone right now.|You’re alone.
No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you’re [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-it’s just not the time for us. I’m sorry.|Ah well, can’t blame a guy for trying!
Oh and , okay?|Yeah, I’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
Rachel, there you are! Come on, let’s serve that dessert already!|Joey, you’re gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don’t get any dessert.
Really?|No, I’m just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it’s trifle time!
Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.|Really?
Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!|Okay.
Well?|Mmmm! It’s good!
Really? How good?|It’s so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who’s eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
Mmm.|Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
I’ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica’s room.|I’ll help you dial.
It tastes like feet!|I like it.
Are you kidding?|What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
Rachel, come here.  Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.|Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
I dunno, let’s see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.|Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
Boy, I’m glad I wore the big belt today.|Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
Ross? Let’s go.|Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
Alright, you know what? That’s it. You’ve had your chance.|Wha-what?
Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!|What?!
I love Jacques Cousteau!|I wasn’t supposed to put beef in the trifle!
Thank you!|No! Thank you!  Monica, and Ross! I don’t know what I’m gonna do about the two of you!
You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn’t feel bad!|Well actually, I-I didn’t eat mine. It’s still in the bathroom.
Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.|That’s a good story, Grandpa.
I dunno what it is, it just doesn’t quite feel like Christmas to me.|Oh, here.
… and that’s the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising life’s triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.|So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.
I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now she’s like OLD NEWS!|Hey guys!
Hi Janine!|I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Year’s Eve. It’s called some sort of Dick’n Rock’n Dickie Eve.
You’re gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!|Well they said I should bring someone.  Do you wanna be my dance partner?
Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.|Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?
Are you serious?|We are there!
Bye Janine!|Did she just ask me out on a date?
It was a dry day.|We are going to Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rocking Eve!
Oh my God!|Oh my God!
OK, listen I’ve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It’s a show, but we’re just dancing, OK? It’s no big deal. The important thing to remember – stay cool.|Got it!
Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.|I can save you time ladies, I’m right here.
We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.|What? That’s terrible!
Don’t worry, we’re just gonna search here for an hour, them we’re gonna go over to Joey’s and search, OK?|No not okay, you can’t look for Monica’s presents!
Chandler, aren’t you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?|No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
Chandler, that’s not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you’ve just gotten her one great present? I mean that’s just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?|If I help, we can find ‘em faster!
That’s right!|Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
Oh, it’s a Macy’s bag!|Ooh, who’s it for?
Dear losers, do you really think I’d hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew they’d break you.|Uh-oh. She may be onto us.
We are so gonna find them this year.|Y’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you don’t, you don’t do that every year do you?
Yeah.|You don’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?
Okay, here comes another camera.|Right. No biggie. Stay loose.
If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. They’ve been taping those people up there all day.|Right.
Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?|Yeah!
I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!|Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.
Those are my gifts, I got them for you.|Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!
Those are book ends! That's a great gift!|Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.
Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?|Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!
Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just..  Looking good Gellers!|We know!
Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that you’re dancing with.|She’s nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!
Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown – I’m trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..|No I don’t think so.
Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she’s real, uh, mellow!|Look, are you dating this girl you came with?
Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know…|No, no. She’s fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!
Alright, alright, hey y’know fair is fair,|God! What are you, in second grade?
Man, this sucks! Y’know if Mom and Dad don’t see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, who’s gonna be the losers then?|Hey, I know what’ll get us up on a platform!
What?|The routine!
Ross, we haven’t done the routine since middle school.|Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, he’ll wanna build us our own platform!
Was it really that good?|We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, it’s almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?
5 6 7 8!|So, do we really have to ask who’s going up on the platform next?
Yes!|Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again it’s gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybody’s excitement.
Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.|What’s going on over here?
Can you believe this? We’re gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!|I know! Hey, you haven’t been practising the routine, have you?
No!|Me too!
Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, y’know?|Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we don’t wanna look stupid!
Hey! Look who I found!|Oh, hey guys!
Y’know, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.|Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.
Or we could just follow your clever jokes – any ideas? No! Didn’t think so! Okay, c’mon guys, show us where the presents are!|Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica that’s as good as garbage?
Hmm, how about my azzz?|Hey, this is hollow.
What?|This bench, it’s hollow! I can’t believe I never knew that!  Oh, the presents!!!
No, don’t look directly at them!|What?
Alright, no, we could look at them!|Oh, this one’s for me!
Oh, this one’s for Chandler. Here.|Oh great!
And the big one’s for me!|Ooh, let’s open them!
Hee hee!|Wait, we can’t do this.
Will you get us better gifts?|Fine!
Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Year’s gonna go off. I guess there’s no reason for all that Y2K panic, y’know? Anyway, g’night!|Joey.
Yeah?|Happy New Year.
Oh, yoii. What was that for?|Well, I don’t know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn’t get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you
Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.|In the moment, yeah.
But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?|Sure, New Year’s Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?
No.|Me neither.
3, 2,|Joey, you don’t have to count down every time we kiss.
We were on the platform, ready to dance the world into the new Millennium, and the guy yelled ‘CUT!’|Uh, wait, so you guys are telling me you actually did the routine from eighth grade?
Yeah. But of course we had to update it a little bit.  Hey, by the way, great thinking about catching me!|‘Cos I was gonna say there’s no way you could’ve done the end the way you guys did it back then!
What? We could do it!|I don’t know, I mean you were a lot bigger, I mean, stronger back then.
I can do it, okay? Come on, let’s go.|1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
I can’t do it!|Now you do that, you’re on TV.
Hey!|Hey!
Listen, do you guys think I have a chance with Janine?|Honey, we have been through this before!
Well all right then, I guess I shouldn’t get to excited about the fact  that I just kissed her!|You serious?!
Oh we kissed it up real nice.|So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
I came over here to tell you guys.|So she’s just waiting over there for ya?
I gotta go.|Okay.
I’m gonna be really late for dance class!|Okay.
Okay, now I’m really late.|Okay, I’m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
Bye.|Bye.
…so then the farmer says, "That’s not a cow and you’re not milking it."|I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
Look at us, we’re a couple of couples!|I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
Yeah all right.  Okay, good night guys.|See ya tomorrow!
How are we gonna get out of that one?|What?
I can’t handle two nights in a row with them.|What-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?
I don’t know, they’re just a little blah!|Blah?!
Well y’know, he’s blah, she’s just—she’s very loud for such a small person.|Uh, they’re like my best friends. Are you saying we can’t hang out with them? ‘Cause that would kinda be a problem.
No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y’know, not two nights in a row. Okay?|I guess.
Thank you.|If you want, I’ll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
Hey!|Hey!
Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?|Guess!
Umm, a flea market?|Ha! See, I knew, I knew you’d get it on the first guess. Isn’t it cool! It’s an apothecary table.
Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where  they kept all the stuff to make their potions.|Ohh, yes.
Y’know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.|Almost.
How much was it?|It was only 500 bucks.
500 bucks at a flea market?!|Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y’know like back then.
Oh no.|Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y’know, it was like a dollar.
A dollar?|And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.|Yeah.
Well, what period is it from?|Uh, it’s from yore. Like the days of yore. Y’know?
Yes, yes I do. God, oh it’s just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y’know where it was from or…|Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
Hey! We’re here!|Hey!
Ohh! Oh my God!|You like it?
Oh no!|It’s my new apothecary table!
Ross! Phoebe’s gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!|Well why not?! She’ll-she’ll love it! It’s the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she’s gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.|Why did you do that?
Because she hates Pottery Barn.|She hates Pottery Barn?!!
I know! I know, she says it’s all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff.  So come on, she’s gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?|What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe—Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!|Uh, yeah! I still can’t believe she hates Pottery Barn!
Ross, get over it! It’s not like she hates you.|Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y’know what I think? It’s just she-she’s weird. Y’know it’s because she’s a twin. Twins are weird.
Ross, she’s not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.|Huh. Y’know what’s not one of a kind? A twin!
Hey!|Hey!
Ooh, Phoebe’s here! Okay, let’s turn out all the lights and we’ll just watch the movie!|Okay. Hey—Ooh, cool sheets!
He got it a flea market!|You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
Hey!|Hi!
The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.|And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight.  You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn’t afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
What happened to Janine?|Oh, she’s uh-uh really sick.
No-no, she really is sick!|Then why-why is she going to a play?!
Uh, y’know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.|Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
Well uh, she didn’t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I’m so sorry.|Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.|What?
I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don’t-don’t be mad. I’m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y’know? And it was our first date! Plus, she’s really sick!|No, you sh—No you said you made that up!!
I know, but don’t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?|Eh, they’re both good. I generally just go with, Monica’s drunk again.
Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She’ll come around I promise.|Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
I can hear you!|I am loud!
Aww!|That’s funny.
Okay, one more time.|Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
Perfect decibel.|I know!!!
Hey.|So uh, what are you guys doing?
Oh nothing, we’re just talking. Y’know, blah-blah-blah.|Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
…see I can’t decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.|Wow! I didn’t know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
I know, I know. I went a little crazy.|A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
Hey.|Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.|Ah!
Well there’s yore. And uh, y’know, yesteryear.|Yeah no, I’m telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y’know if you ever decide you need to redecorate—And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
Oh honey he doesn’t need my help.|Oh, come on! I think he’s ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
Y’know what? I don’t, I don’t think Phoebe really wants to come.|No! I do want to!
Oh, she does want to.|She does want to.
Pheebs, I don’t know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.|Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
Yeah.|Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
Yeah, y’know what? Don’t look at it.|No! Look-look! There’s the coffee table they stole from us!
Ugh, those bastards! Let’s go.|That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the…wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
No! No! No! No it’s not! No it’s not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don’t have the…  We don’t have the…that lamp! And-and that screen is y’know, on the other side.|Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
Okay! Okay-okay look—no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just… Come on don’t be mad.|No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it’s all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don’t have that lamp!
Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.|I can’t! I can’t! Unless… Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn’t buy that lamp?
What?! No! I’m not gonna move out!|But are you saying that you would move out if I didn’t buy that lamp?
Oh. Yes! I would so move out!|Okay then I don’t have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
That’s right!|But at least the apothecary table is real.
Well, this-this-this was great. Didn’t everybody have a great time?|Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I’ve got to say, I’m sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
Oh well then, good night!|Good night!
See? Eh, wasn’t that fun?|We have got to move!
All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough!|Y’know I think you can take her.
All right, uh, we’ve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can’t treat them that way.|They said stuff to me too, y’know!
I know! I know! And I’m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They… They’re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I… I don’t think we can be together. It just, it just can’t work. It can’t.  I’m very upset.|Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
What did I tell you about the hall?!|I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I’d really like it if we could be friends.
Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.|Great.
Now come on.  Well, I’m glad we worked things out.|Me too.
Okay.|I’ll see you.
Bye.|Or I’ll hear you.
Come on!|Wait!
You’d better run!|Did you hear that?
Hey!|How ya doin’?
Y’know what would cheer you up?|What?
I’m giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.|You’re right! That did cheer me up!
Hey, you’re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!|I didn’t know Playboy prints jokes.
Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It’s not just about the pictures.|That didn’t work on mom, it’s not going to work on us.
Here, check it out. It’s the first one, too.|That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
What?|I made that joke up.
Uh, oh-oh, no you didn’t. I did.|Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke he’d ever heard.
What?|I’m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny.
Look, Chandler, it’s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they don’t print the name, so it doesn’t really matter who gets credit, right?|Yeah, I guess.
No, it’s my joke, it’s mine. You can call them, they’ll tell you.|It’s my joke.
It’s my joke.|Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?
Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.|Let’s go watch it at your place.
Nah, Monica’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don’t want to miss when they were skinny.|Chandler, Chandler, y’know what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.
What? No, I want to watch this. . Did your cable go out?|No, that’s VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . It’s like a lotta noise to me. I don’t know…
Joey, why is your cable out?|I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven’t really paid the bill
If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?|No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.
Whoa ho.|I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book .
All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?|Sure.
Paid your phone bill?|Not so much.
Hey.|It’s only you.
Wh-wh-what are you doing?|We are looking at a Playboy.
Oh, I want to look too! . Yikes!|So do you think that these pictures—Are, are they trying to tell a story?
Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?|Yeah.
Rachel.|What?!
You forget how many great songs Heart had.|Yeah.
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.|What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.
Ah, Gunther, I can’t pay for this right now because I’m not working, so I’ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin’ for stuff.|Well, if you want, you can work here.
Uh, I don’t know. Ya see, it’s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y’know? And to go from that to this, I just… Plus, I’d have to wait on all my friends.|Okay, but the money’s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.
What?!|Flexible hours.
She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.|He took my joke, he took it.
It’s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.|You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? I’m going to get a joke journal. Y’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.
That’s a good idea.|Yeah!
Do you know what’s a bad idea?|Picking Rachel.
That’s right.  Did you hear something?|Maybe it’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
It’s coming from the living room.|
Hey, you guys.|Hey.
Oh, don’t you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.|Monica, what are you doing?
Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.|I guess it was kinda funny.
It wasn’t funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn’t you pick me?|Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you’re … just … kinda high maintenance—Okay let’s go to lunch!
That is completely untrue. You think I’m high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we’re going to go through it point by point!|No, okay, you’re right. You’re easy-going. You’re just not as easy-going as Rachel. She’s just more flexible and-and mellow. That’s all.
I cannot believe her.|I know. Where do you wanna go eat?
Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.|I’m sick of Japanese. We’re not going there.
All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.|All right.
Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.|Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.
Uh, yeah, I’ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.|Sure.  Coffee? ‘Cause I’m going up there.
Joey, what’s going on. What didn’t you tell us you work here?|It’s kind of embarrassing, y’know. I mean, I was an actor and now I’m a waiter. It’s supposed to go in the other direction.
Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.|Okay.
Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.|Hah!
So, what, you’re just, you’re just okay with being flaky?|Yeah, totally.
Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.|That’s great. Good for you guys.
I am not a pushover!|Who said you were?
Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.|No, I’m leaving to get my hair dyed.
Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it’s a great part. Look, check it out. I’m the lead guy’s best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. ‘I’m sorry, that seat’s saved.’|That’s the whole part?
Okay, maybe he’s not his best friend, but …|Okay, I’ll see you in an hour.
Oh, man, I could totally get that part. ‘I’m sorry, that seat is taken.’|Oh, excuse me.
No, no, I didn’t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?|I believed you were saving this seat for someone.
So, you’d hire me, right?|For what?
Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.|Huh? What?
It’s my joke.|It’s my joke.
Y’know, I don’t think we’re going to settle this.|Let’s have Monica decide.
Yeah!|Yeah!
Hey Mon.|Mon, get out here!
Monica!|Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.
Yeah.|I can’t be fair. You’re my boyfriend.
Yeah, but I’m your brother. We’re family. That’s the most important thing in the world.|I’m your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let’s go.
We’ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth—me.|Okay, Chandler, you go first.
See, I would never snap at you like that.|Continue.
Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I’m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I’m Doctor Monkey!|I’m not arguing with that.
It’s your joke.|Is not.
Hi, Chandler. There you are.|Hi, oh hi.
Hey, it’s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don’t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?|—generosity of spirit.
Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.|I’m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?
Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!|You’re a little high maintenance.
Ahhh! You are on my list.|I’m sorry. You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, but it’s okay, because I like … maintaining you.
. All right you’re off my list.|
Phoebe, it’s okay that you don’t want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.|Y’know, suddenly I find you very attractive.
Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.|I pick you, Phoebe.
Yeah, well, I kinda thought.|Hey.
Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that’s  $12.75.|This coming from the man who couldn’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
Hi!|How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
Oh that’s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.|Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
Well, he’s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him—He says it’s okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!|Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn’t free?
It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I’m getting more dates than ever!|Wait a minute, you’re only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
How about a scone on the house baby?|I’m pretty.
Hey does anyone have any gum?|Oh I do!  I know it’s in here somewhere.
Y’know what? I’m good! I’m good!|Hey!
Hey!|Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be at work?
When you put a ‘D’ at the end of ‘Fine’ you’re not fine.|I’m fine-d. I’m fine-d! Y’know, it’s a really hard word to say.
Hi Jill.|And that’s Phoebe , and that’s Joey.
Are you all finished here?|Yes.
Great!|Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
What?!|For all the free food you gave away.
Well if it’s free food, how come you’re charging me for it?|We don’t give anything away unless it’s someone’s birthday.
Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?|No!
|
Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let’s do something crazy!|I know, let’s rest and drink lots of fluids.
Okay, I’ll rest. But y’know if I’m going to bed, then you’re coming with me.|That would be impossible to resist if you weren’t all drippy here.
|Yeah, I don’t you should say that even when you’re healthy.
I’m with you Chandler! I mean I can’t have sex with a sick person either, that’s disgusting! But I’m not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.|That’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
Hey!|Hey.
What’s up?!|Umm, I think there’s something you should maybe know.
Well, it’d better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.|No. No. It’s just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I’m pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
What?!|Yeah I mean it’s probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
With Ross and Jill?|Yeah!
With Ross and my sister?|Yeah.
With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?|Yeah.
Oh there is no way.|Okay then.
Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don’t really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn’t that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they’re gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can’t stop it! I can’t—I don’t own Ross! Y’know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can’t believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.|But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
That’ll be $3.85.|What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
It’s just I can’t because my manager said I…  "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie…|Amy!
"…Amy! Happy birthday to you!"|Hey, that’s weird, today’s my birthday too!
Yeah, not it here it isn’t.|Sorry I’m late, what’s up?
Chandler!|Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup?  Oh-ohhhh!
Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.|Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.|I was asleep.  Oh no! No-no honey! Y’know what’s sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I’m not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.|Would you please get some rest!
"Happy birthday to you!"|You’re paying for that.
What? No-no it’s her birthday!|You’ve sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
But it really…|You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
Damnit!|Rach? Hi!
Chandler, I think I’m sick.|Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?|No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
Come on! I really need your help!|No-no-no-no-no!
Fine, I’ll rub it on myself.|Okay.
Yeah?|It’s nice.
Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?|Yes!
I can’t believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?|It’s all very, very good.  So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
Not now, I’m sick!|Oh come on you big faker!
What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?|Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
Okay, if you really wanna have sex…|Okay!
Hi!|Hi! Wh-what are you doing here?
This is where Ross and I are meeting for our date. So, what do you think?|Well, I-I don’t like it.
Really?!|It’s kinda slutty.
It’s yours!|Yeah well, I’m-I’m a slut.
Me too.|Hi Jill!
Hey!|Hi .
Why aren’t you home yet?!|Is someone there?
Oh yes, it’s me! Sorry!|What are you doing here?
Uh, I’m just, I’m just looking out your window. At-at the view. What are you guys doing?|We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
Oh, he brought her back to his apartment.|Is that your sister?
Ugh, she is a slut!|God, Ross is on a date with your sister! How weird is that?!
Oh my God, look-look he’s taking off her clothes!|He’s taking off her coat!
Oh, this is just terrible.|Oh no it’s not, no it’s not. It’s a first date. I’m sure that nothing is gonna…
Oh.|Ho-oh, he’s gonna get some!
Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh… Oh wait, I don’t have to lie to you, you don’t live here anymore. Uh, I’m eating their food. What are you doing?|Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
Whoa, I didn’t know we could date your sister!|Joey we know you steal our food.
I can’t believe Ross went out with Rachel’s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.|That was like 5 years ago.
Yeah you got 5 years left!|Joey…
Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!|Hey!
So how was your big date last night?|Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?|I guess so.
So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!|No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
Oh, slides.  So really nothing happened.|Something could’ve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
Right. Was it the, "Please don’t show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"|Anyway, if she, if she wasn’t in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
She asked-asked you out again?|Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine’s Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can’t! I can’t! I can’t! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can’t. It’s just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can’t do it! I can’t do it.|It’s okay. Hey, it’s too weird for you, I won’t see her again.
Thank you. I…yeah.|I mean after tomorrow night.
No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can’t! I can’t do it!  It’s just gonna freak me out!!!|Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I’ll-I’ll tell her tonight I can’t see her anymore.
Ross thanks.|You want me to call her right now?
Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that’s-that’s crazy—I mean that’s crazy. So what’s-what’s going on with you? What is going on with you?|Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
This is my favorite part.|Yeah me too.
Chandler there’s nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don’t have to be so macho all the time.|I’m not macho.
Yeah you’re right. I don’t know what I was thinking.|No, I guess I just never really cried. Y’know? I’m not a crying kind of guy.
Oh, I’ve got it! I have got it!  Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!|All right, what’s going on there?
Where were your parents?|Oh they didn’t want to come!
Poor thing!|So that story doesn’t make you cry?
Excuse me.|Yeah?
Are you Phoebe Buffay?|Yeah.
Can-can I get your autograph, I’m your biggest fan.|Oh you’re my biggest fan? I’ve always wanted to meet you! Hi!
Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you’re really talented.|You’re just saying that because you’re my biggest fan.
I have no idea what you’re talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay’s autograph!|Oh, you’re Phoebe’s fan!
Oh yeah! I’ve seen all her movies.|Movies?
That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.|I don’t think so.
No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren’t gonna believe this!|Hey Gunther, don’t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe’s a porn star!
Hey!|Hey!
You’ll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn’t even tell me why!|Ohhh well. Y’know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He’s a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
Y’know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I’m not gonna date some random guy from your work.|It’s not random, it’s Bob.
It’s probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn’t like the way I dress—No that can’t be it. It’s really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I’m so stupid! I’m just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!|No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
You asked him too?!|Hm-mmm.
Why?!|Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history…
I don’t understand, do you want to go out with Ross?|No.
You don’t want him, but you don’t want me to have him?|Y’know Bob in Human Resources…
Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was!  You had me doubting my fashion sense!|Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don’t date Ross! There’s a million other guys out there, you just…
Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.|I’m not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
Why are you so jealous of me?|Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can’t have!
Can’t have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can’t have is dairy!|All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
Who?!|In Human Resources!!!!!!
…I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!|You’re jealous of Princess Caroline?
Do I have my own castle?|Hey! Uh, Phoebe’s not here is she?
No.|Oh great! Did you get a movie?
Oh my God!|That’s Phoebe! Where did you get that?
Wow! I mean, I just—I can’t, I can’t believe this. Y’know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who’s always been somewhat of a question mark.|This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y’know she had such a terrible childhood.
Absolutely not.|Y’know maybe a little bit!
Probably just the first half.|No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe’s our friend! Well, I’m not gonna watch it!
Well it’s hard to tell…  Oh God, if she would just stop moving.|She’s just doing her job!
Oh, it’s a tattoo! That’s weird, Phoebe doesn’t… Wait that’s Ursula! That’s not Phoebe that is Ursula!|Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
Hey sweetie!|Hey!
Chicken Soup for the Soul?|There’s no back to this couch!
Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.|Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn’t think I was y’know, all dead inside.
Oh that’s so sweet! Look Chandler I don’t care if you can’t cry, I love you.|Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
Stop it!|No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we’re up at the altar and I’m like this.
I won’t care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.|Yeah?
Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don’t cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won’t matter to me.|Okay, well I won’t uh, worry about this anymore then.
And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you’re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can’t shed one tiny tear, I know you’ll be crying a river inside.|Aww, I love you so…
What is wrong with you?!!!|What?!
What?! You can’t shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!|So you didn’t mean any of that?!
You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to…  Uhh what’s-what’s-what’s the matter?|Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we’re not supposed to see each other anymore and I’m okay with that, it’s just that I don’t know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
Of course, what happened?|I don’t want to talk about it.
Okay, umm…|But you know what might really cheer me up?
What?|Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
Wow! Really?!|Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
Well, I’d love to! Here, you wait right here and I’ll go get the projector and my notes!|Oh great! Thanks Ross, you’re such a good friend!
Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can’t find her anywhere.|No, I haven’t.
Who is it?|It’s Phoebe! Phoebe!
Hey!|Oh God. So-so you’re making porn movies.
No I’m not.|We’re still rolling!
Yeah, can I help you with something?|Phoebe, come on!
Y’know, twin stuff is always a real big seller.|What?!
Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.|No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you!
Slides are almost ready.|Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
Uh okay, well there’s-there’s wine in the kitchen.|Oh great!
Hello?|What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she’s really upset we’re just talking.|Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
So that’s the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn’t have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I’m a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!|Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
Y’know what? I think I can take care of myself, I’ll talk to you later. Good-bye.  Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you’re just using me.|So?
Hey!|Hey!
So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.|Oh no, not you too!
No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay’s checks; there were a lot of them.|Nice!
Um-mmm, and I won’t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.|That’s great, but isn’t it gonna bother that people still think you’re a porn star?
Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.|You do?
Yeah.  See?|Yeah.
Hey.|You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
Maybe we should give them some privacy.|Shhhh!!!
All right, I’m leaving! Because I’m not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That’s you Rachel!|Yeah, I got that.
And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?|You take care Jill.
|Bye-bye-e!
Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!|Oh my God!
Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.|Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her?
Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.|Why did they get divorced?
Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?|I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced.
Merrill Lynch?|Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
Well why didn’t you take the job?|Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
Oh my God! Rachel Green?|Rob Tillman!
No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross!|Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman.
No, no-no, Ross Geller.|Ohh, of course Monica’s brother!
Yeah. Right.|Wow! How are you?!
Good-good, I’m-I’m married.|Ohh! Me too!
Is-isn’t it the best?|Oh, it’s the best!  So, umm how’s Monica?
Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.|Ohh, I would love too.
Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited!|Ohh! Okay!
Come on!|Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies?
No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…|Oh yeah? Okay.
Okay.|But! Don’t you have to give him his money back?
So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?|He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.
Wow!!|Can anyone else name a well known seed that’s been masquerading as a nut?
Oh dear God, let me think.|Hey.
Hey.|Oh no! What’s the matter?
Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?|Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
Really?|Ehh.
That’s an idea!  Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?|No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that!|I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
Oh right great! Welcome aboard!|Okay!
All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break!|All right!
|Ohhh!  No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.
Hi!|Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you…
Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans.|Ah!
She’s not crazy is she?|No.
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!  What kind of name is Brendy? I… Whatever… Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.|Hey there you are!
No-no!! No!!|Oh wait! You didn’t just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.|But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.|What?!
My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can’t breathe.|Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?|Yes!!
Then yes that is what I’m having.|Oh my God!
Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks.|Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan.
Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.|Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
Yeah.|How long has it been since you had sex?
Well, last weekend…|Oh that’s not so bad.
…will be two months…|That is.
…since I stopped trying.|Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
What-what do you mean?|I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other…
Oh.|Y’know, dirty talk, m�nage � trois, toys…
Wow!|Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
Okay, I think I got it.|Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching!  It never happened.
Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey?|Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I’m with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I’m lost and I can’t find food."
Yeah! She’s right in there!|Oh great.  Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
All right, and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.|Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else?
Well, that is a large piece of television equipment.  And uh that is an old man! Hey old man!|Hey!
All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?|Wow! Umm, y’know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn’t.
Why?  Why can’t the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?|Isn’t that a line from the show?!
Uh, yeah but uh,  I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.|That’s a line from the show too!
Okay, you watch too much TV.|
Thanks!|Yeah?
I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay?|I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude.  Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.|Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
Iced tea.|Okay, anything for you sir?
Did I not just tell him?|Yes, you did.
You’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya?|It’s not all juice!
So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.|Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.|What do you mean?
Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working…|
Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!|Yay!
Yay!  Seriously, our sex life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun?|Like what?
Well I don’t know umm,  Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.|I love that idea!
Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!|Oh my God! That’s great! Oh wow!  You’re a published writer! I wish I had a present for you!
Aww.|Wait a minute!  My last Kit-Kat bar!
You wanna share it?|Okay!!
What’s this?|Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it.
Aww, thanks man.|Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story.|Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them.|Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it!
Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?|Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!|Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married?
Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y’know I just wish we could be like on a break!|Well, you’re not.
Oh, it’s so easy for you I mean, you’re not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!|Yeah I can!
Monica. You’ve, you’ve done it right?|Of course I have! What do you think, I’m some 30 year old virgin?
Oh my God! You’re a 30 year old virgin!|Say it louder, I don’t think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you’ve waited long enough!!|Y’know what? You are right?!
Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn’t be all this rules and restrictions! Y’know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever…|Rachel! I’m never gonna think it’s okay for you to cheat on your husband!
Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!|Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
Phoebe! Put that cigarette out!|No! It’s not a cigarette! The smoke is coming out of me!
Put it out!!|Okay! Okay!  I’m so glad you’re here.
You’ve done all you can Dr. Wesley. You have got to let her go.|Good-bye and God speed, Hope Brady.
Hope! Hope!|Drake!
You’re not dying Hope, you’re gonna live a long, healthy life. With me.|Oh Drake.
So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find…|Ooh, actually I’ve been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
Oh.|Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so…
Oh, I know.  Y’know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda…|Oh, me too.
Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben’s asleep.|Oh umm, y’know I think it would be better if we just save it.
Hey, Pheebs!|Hey.
Hey, how’s it going?|Well, I’ve got to get out of this bed, I’m going crazy here. Crazy!
She doesn’t know she was fired yet, does she?|No, the doctors say it may kill her.
Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.|Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
Ohh, I mean it’s just so realistic!|I know.  Yeah, his name is Pat.
Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!|Do you uh, do you—ready for a refill?
Oh, I probably shouldn’t—so I will!  Oh! Wow! It’s like it’s raining!|Pretty cool, huh? But if you’re thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn’t get sucked up into the mechanism, well you’d be wrong.
Umm, can I use your bathroom?|It’s uh, right through there.
Okay.  God y’know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani’s apartment…|Yeah, life’s pretty great isn’t it?
I hope you’re hungry, we’re starting with oysters. And y’know what they say about oysters, don’t you?|They have parasites?
No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.|What people?
People! People say it! Come here!|So oysters, huh?
And then we’re gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.|Y’know, it’s funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases…
No-no-no, no! It’s sensual!|Ohh! Didn’t know! Okay!
Okay!  Ohhh no!|I’m sorry sweetie, it’s the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
We’re really gonna do this, huh?|Looks like it.
Y’know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at…|I got it!
Okay.|
I’m-I’m Ross by the way.|I love what you’ve done with this space.
I’m sorry you’re here with me instead of Roger.|Yeah, me too.
Well, I could make it seem like he’s here.|Stop it!! That’s not funny!!
Okay.|I’m sorry, okay? It just—tonight was supposed to be y’know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
What was tonight?|You don’t want to know what tonight was.
Okay.  What was tonight?|Well, tonight was—was going to be my first time.
With Roger?  Oh my God!|All right relax Mr. I’ve Had Sex Four Times!
Four different women! I’ve had sex way more times!|How many?
Nine.|I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?|No. He’s not a horrible guy.
Hey that’s what I tell girls about me.|Chandler, I’m gonna die a virgin!
No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.|Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
Okay.|I was kidding.
Joey, you’re such an amazing actor!  How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?|Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
Wow! Tell me something Joey——Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.|Yeah you did.
Okay.|Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
Yeah?|When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
Wow! I can’t, I can’t feel my hands.|Come, come here.
We can’t do this.|No!  Oyster?
Yeah!  If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y’know? Because you’ve been waiting a very long time and I wouldn’t want to disappoint you.|Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you’re horrible, how would I know?
I do like that.|It’s harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?|Absolutely! It would just be one friend
Stop it! We’re doing this! Let’s do it!|Noo!! Okay!!
Okay!|Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
I have some moves.|I have no moves.  Oh y’know what? I’m sorry, this is just too weird.
Yeah, let’s just forget it.|What if I turn out the lights?
Oh yeah.|Chandler?
Yeah?|That’s the couch.
Oh my God!|I know! I’ll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
Morning!|Oh right.
Yeah.|Oh God. Oh I can’t believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
Well he actually saw you a little bit too.|Noo! Oh God we did—we didn’t, we didn’t uhh…
No! No! No, not after seeing that.|God I’m just a horrible person.
Wh-why?|Because I’m married. That’s right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star’s apartment to have an affair! Uck!
That’s ridiculous! I’m not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.|Yeah and I’m a horrible, horrible person.
Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me…|The ring from the cave, yeah.
Wow! Uh okay, well uh…|Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
Sure! As long as they don’t find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.|No! No-no-no…
Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you’ve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn’t. And that’s what this ring stands for.|But I thought that ring stood for Caprice’s undying love for her brother.
Look, do you want the ring or not?!|Yeah!
Hey!|Hey!
Look at you! You’re up!|All right!
Hey Joe did… Did you ever have a threesome?|Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol’s great and I’m sure you’re a very attractive man, but I….
No! The reason I’m asking is that… I sorta had one last night.|You?
Yeah!|Wow!
It was, it was okay.|Just okay—Did you do it right?!
Look, it’s just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren’t here?"|Huh. But still Ross, you’re worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y’know what I mean?
It’s just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.|But you got to be with both of them, right?
Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.|Not the other one?
No, she kept kicking me away!|Yeah, you don’t want that.
No!|Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
Oh I a lot of stuff!|You got a little bored?
A little. Yeah. I made a snack.|Yeah? What did ya have?
Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard…|Sounds good.
Hey!|Hey!
Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!|Hey, check me out, I’m a slut!
So you uh, want to do something tonight?|Oh I can’t. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you’re still seeing him and uh, he’s a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when…|Are you okay?
Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?|Great! It’s so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I’m all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
I bet he can.|Y’know, I don’t have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical.  Are you sure you’re okay?
Ohh! My God! Barry!!|You-you-you said you were gonna be away all weekend!
Surprise! Look who’s back!|Hey Pheebs!
Hey!|Pheebs, didn’t you get fired?
Uh, I don’t think so!|Phoebe?
Jack!! Hey!|What are you doing here?
All better! Back to work! Except this clown from research told me I was fired. He should do his research, huh?|Well, you were fired.
Nu-uh!|I told that guy who answered your phone.
Oh, okay I didn’t get that message. So this doesn’t count—Anyway, I’ll be in my office.|Uh, Phoebe you-you don’t have an office.
That’s all right, I’ll work here. This is goo, next to this plant.|Phoebe, listen…
You’re in my office! Look, I have made a lot of cash for this company! Okay? I am talking big bucks! Pesos! Yen! Rubles! You make one little mistake…|You lost 13 million dollars.
Oh, so this is all about money! Y’know it’s bad enough that—Ow! Oh, you have got to be kidding!|Are you all right?
I’m having another heart attack!|What?!
I’m having another heart attack!! Call 9-1-1!!|Take it easy.
Dumbass!|Hey Pheebs! How’s it going?!
Well, they fired me and I’m having heart attack.|Wow! Well, welcome back!
Hi Ross!|Hey Rachel.
Is Joey Tribbiani here?|Umm, no.
Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I’m looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!|That-that’s always good news. Are you okay?
Me? I’m great! I’m fine! I’m sooo good!! But, you know who’s not great?! Men! You’re a man right Ross?!|Yeah.
Sit down!|Okay.
Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we’re going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor’s dog walker?!|We’re sorry.
No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?|Didn’t you spend last night at Joey’s?
Aw what are you?! A detective?|Look I-I don’t know what’s going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
Oh.|Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
Who are these men?|Men. I guy I know.
Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is  gay.|She is not…  She’s gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can’t believe this.
Good day for married people huh?|I’m sorry your husband cheated on you.
I’m sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren’t that great either.|Try telling my wife that.
Okay to come in?|Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?|What?!
I’m the ruptured spleen.|Why would you do that?
Because you shouldn’t be with him.  You should be with me.|Really?
Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don’t just happen. Y’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y’know I was just lying there and I couldn’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y’know with a friend.|Chandler!
I know you probably don’t want to go out with me, y’know because I make too many jokes and I’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess I’m not technically a "doctor…"|There was just one woman, wasn’t there?
No, there were two.|Including me?
|Adam Chase
Hey, remember when I had a monkey?|Yeah.
Yeah, what, what was I thinking?|Hey! So, what’s with the 20 percent tip? Did I do something wrong?
What’s up with the greed Joe?|All right, look I’m sorry you guys, but it’s just that I gotta get these new head shots made. And they’re really expensive, y’know? I’m down to like three! Well, actually two ‘cause one of ‘em I kinda blackened in some teeth—Why did I do that?!
Well isn’t there something you can do to earn a little extra money? I mean, can’t-can’t you pick up, I don’t know, an extra shift here?|Or, y’know, I used to beg for money. Of course it helps if you’ve got y’know a little of this  goin’ on. Wow! I still have it!
Oh, wait! Wait! Don’t you have an audition today? Yeah! Maybe you’ll get that job!|Oh, ha-ha-ha! Ooh! Wait a minute, I used to get medical experiments down on me all the time!
Hi!|Hey!
Hey, what have you guys been up to?|Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!
Wow!|Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!
After one class? I don’t think so.|What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there  and pretend you’re a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!
Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, that’s not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and there’s a concept you should really be familiar with. It’s what the Japanese call  unagi.|Isn’t that a kind of sushi?
No, it’s a concept!|Yeah it is! It is! It’s freshwater eel!
All right, maybe it means that too…|Ohh! I would kill for a salmon skin roll right now!
Y’know what? Fine! Get attacked! I don’t even care!|Come on Ross. We’re sorry. Please tell us what it is.
Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!|You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?
All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesn’t mean you have unagi.|Ooh! Y’know what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.
Y’know what…|Hey-hey, is Monica here?
No.|Okay, look I need your help, I don’t know what to get her for Valentine’s Day.
So what are you gonna do?|Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?
|Hey!
Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the Valentine’s Day gifts?|Oh, yeah.
Do we have to make the entire thing?|Yes! Why, did you—you forget to make yours?
Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up.|Okay.  I can’t believe it! Make the presents! Make the presents!
What?|I’m just so excited to make the presents!  Shoot!
Hi uh, I’m Joey Tribbiani and with all do respect I’d like to donate some fluids.|We’re actually at the end of one of our research cycles, so we’re not looking for applicants right now.
Oh that’s too bad. I’ve kinda been saving up.  Uh, are you sure there’s no studies I can participate in?|Well, here’s a schedule of what’s coming up.
Thanks.|Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It’s a twins study.
But it’s $2,000.|Sorry.
Well how about this one? Testing the effects of Joey Tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.|We already got the results back on that on, and they’re not good.
DANGER!!! DANGER!!!!!|Ross!!!
A lesson in the importance of unagi.|Ohh, you’re a freak!!
Perhaps. Now I’m curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?|All right, so we weren’t prepared!
Hey.|Chandler. I sensed it was you.
What?!|Unagi. I’m always aware.
Okay, are you aware unagi  is an eel?|What’s up?
I can’t figure out what to make Monica.|Oh, why don’t you make her one of your little jokes.
I’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?|Y’know what? She’d-she’d love this.  Uh, it’s an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.
Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.|Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didn’t actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.
Wait a minute, I can’t give this to her.|Why not?
Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.|Oh.
Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?|Sure! Okay, you go first.
Okay, come here! Come here.|Okay!
Now, it’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it.|Okay.
But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.|Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!
Maybe we’ll have to listen and see!|Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!
Okay!|Okay, you ready to open yours?
Yeah!|Okay.
It’s a sock bunny.|Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?
Not really.|Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See that’s what this is about.
I see. Y’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.|No! No, she doesn’t. Uh Phoebe, what she makes—that’s uh—they’re sock rabbits. They are completely different—Okay! Okay! Okay! I didn’t make it! I’m sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that we’re supposed to make the presents!
Oh, it’s okay. I don’t…|No-no, it’s not okay! It’s not! I mean you were just… You’re so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Y’know I’m just gonna—I, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here
Wow!  You are way to young to have seen that!|Oops!  Y’know, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?
You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.|We have got to wash that!
Yeah!|Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?
You have done enough!|I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!
No you don’t—get it in black, not brown.|Oop, your cake is ready!
Well, it’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.|Hey Mon! Hey Chann!
Who the hell is Carl?!|Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.
Y’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren’t they?|Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y’know? The only problem is, Carl’s acting is…
Pat Sajak?|Yep!
Alex Trebek?|Oh, of course!
Chuck Woolery?|Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, who’s ass I cannot kick.
Say it!|Say we are unagi!
All right Carl, we’re next. Now remember, what is not gonna be?|Another Minute Maid fiasco.
That’s right! And what are you not gonna do?|Well, I’m not gonna talk because…
|
That’s us.|But uh, this is a study for identical twins.
That’s right, $2,000.|But, you’re not identical twins.
Oh my good God.|Hey! Continuing the countdown of your favorite meals. Tonight, No. 3, macaroni and cheese with cut up hot dogs.
Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.|I will! But not tonight. For dinner music, I thought we could listen to that tape you made me.
Oh, the mixed tape.|The Way You Look Tonight is on here! Dance with me?
Okay ladies, that ends today’s class, and let’s remember, let’s be safe out there.|It’s a great class.
Thanks.|Yeah, yeah, I was watching.  Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?
Well, she would take her keys and try to jam them…|No. No-no. No. What would you do next?
Who? Me the attacker?|Yes that’s right.
Why?|I tired attacking two women, did not work.
What?!|No, I mean it’s okay, I mean, they’re-they’re my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.
Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!|Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here. Maybe we could attack them together?  That-that’s a no.
I am so, so, so, so sorry!|Uh-huh.
And I will cook anything you want in here|And, are you kiddin’ me?!
Come on Monica, it’s our Valentine’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?|Okay.
Okay.|My funny valentine, sweet comic valentine! You make me high over my heart!
So, are we going in there?|I am!!
I don’t like sitting up here! I’m just gonna over…|No Rachel! They got here first!
Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!|We should help him!
Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller’s class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"|Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there’s a big selling calendar, eh?
Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.|Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
Yeah.|Oh, ‘cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there’s your admirer.
It’s a girl! Anyway, it wou—it wouldn’t matter. Okay? Because I’m a teacher and she’s a student.|Oh, is that against the rules?
No, but it is frowned upon.|I see.
Besides, there’s a big age difference.|Oh, well think of it like this, when you’re 90…
I know when I’m 90 she’ll be like 80 and it won’t seem like such a big difference.|No that’s not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you’re 90 you’ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
Hey Chandler! Y’know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?|Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
Oh well listen, anyway she’s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!|Oh, I don’t know man. I haven’t talked to her in like ten years.
No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!|You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred…
Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?|Oh okay, I’ll-I’ll try.
All right! Thanks! You’re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?|Yeah so, Tuesday?
Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!|Thank you.
Okay.|Hey Mon? I’m gonna check my messages.
|Professor Geller?
Coming through!  No! Right! Coming through!|Oh well, it’s not so bad.
Oh!|My God!
Oh, it’s bad. It’s really bad. The only thing in there that isn’t burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!|How’s your room Rach?
No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.|No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It’s me! It’s me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!|Okay Phoebe calm down, there’s no need to place blame. Okay?  I warned her about those candles.
God, it’s great to catch up! I can’t believe how long it’s been!|Chandler, is that…
Oh that’s great! Good for you.|Hey-hey listen…
Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm…  What?!|When you’re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
|Hey listen, so when’s-when’s my audition? I mean I know it’s Thursday, but what time?
Hi.|Hey!
We didn’t get to the audition. I’m gonna take her to coffee and then we’ll do it then.|Ah-ha!
Honey, it is not a date! I haven’t talked to her in ten years! You can’t just call up somebody you haven’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.|You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s not like you’re y’know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
No, we only went out once.|You dated her!
Not once!|All right, well why don’t I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
Oh that’s great, my friend Joey’s in the movie business.|Y’know who I ran into from school? Howie.
My friend’s name is Joey.|Apparently Howie’s editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y’know I-I-I haven’t spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
Yeah, I’ve always hated that Howie.|No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
The nerve huh?|Yeah!
Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?|Oh my God! It sure didn’t look this way when I lived here.
I know! Now look, there’s only one problem though. There’s only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey’s.|Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess  you should get to stay here.
So Rach! You’re the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you’ll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y’know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.|I have.
This right here is where I keep the pizza.|What’s that smell?
Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!|What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
Who?|Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone’s name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?|Umm, no. No.
Yes you did! What was it?|Umm, it’s Cutie McPretty.
Ohh that’s so sweet!|Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I’m having a great time! Y’know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it’s not. I mean it’s not at all.
So did you sleep well last night?|I did.
Yeah?|I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
Y’know what Joey left on my pillow?|What?
Gum!|Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!|No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It’s looks like a curling iron.
I don’t use a curling iron.|Well someone does.
Now there you go! I wouldn’t want my best guest to strain her eyes!|Thanks Monica!
Does that smell bother you?|What the smell from Joey’s? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
Well you let me know if you can, because y’know I can bake a pie to cover it.|I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
Okay!|Okay.
Hello?  It’s for you. It’s the fire inspector.|Oh!  Really?!
We had such a great time! She’s-she’s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn’t. It wasn’t at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age.  A concept lost on some people!|So it’s okay to date a student.
Well, not really. I mean technically it’s-it’s not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.|Well Ross, you be careful now. You don’t want to get a reputation as y’know Professor McNailshisstudents.
Yeah. What-what should I do?|Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what’s more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
Going out with who?|Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
Oh yeah! Wasn’t she uh…|No, that was Dana Caplin.
Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!|Y’know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!|Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don’t feel that way about you.
Oh no-no-no, that’s not—No-no-no!|I’m sorry Chandler, y’know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don’t want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
No-no—Really?!|Of course!
Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh…|Ohh, I’m sorry.
Well maybe there is one thing you can do.|What?! Anything! Anything!
Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?|Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
Hey! How’s it goin’?|Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
Yes it has! I made cookies!|Oh that’s all right. I’m still full from your homemade potato chips.
But you should eat them now because they’re hot from the oven.|Okay.
Oh-ho! But not in here! Can’t eat ‘em in bed, remember? No crumbies!|Okay, I’ll be out in a second.
What are you doing?|That doesn’t lock does it?
Oh, Joey! Sorry!|No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!|Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
Really?|Yeah! Look!
I’ve never lived like this before.|I know.
What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?|Uhh, I can’t.
Oh, you have some studying to do?|No, I have some turning 21 to do.
Y’know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to…|What are you doing?
Nothing, I’m-I’m just, I’m so comfortable with you!|Do you not want to be seen with me?
What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?|Uh no, they’re still here but I think I’m about to leave.
What?! No! No! Wait! You’re right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There’s nothing wrong with that. Come on.  Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.|Hi!
That’s right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we’re dating. And you may frown upon that, but we’re not gonna hide it anymore.|You are so fired.
What?|They’re gonna fire you! You can’t date a student! It’s against the rules.
I love it at Joey’s!|Hey, here you go.
Thanks!|So, you busy Thursday?
Hi!|Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
Uh-huh.|Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I’m partly at fault. You see, I didn’t, I didn’t tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y’know let’s just face it, that’s just kindling! So I think it’s better that I stay at Joey’s.
No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y’know what? I’m fine here.|Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don’t want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!|No but at Monica’s you can eat cookies over the sink!
I know. I’m sorry.|All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can’t date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can’t believe we have to stop seeing each other.|For what it’s worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can’t date. It’s against the rules. It’s forbidden.|Wow!
What?|Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it’s really hot.
Really?|Yeah.
Well I-I-I don’t care how hot it is it’s-it’s uh, it’s wrong.|Stop it!
No! No! It’s wrong! It’s-it’s-it’s naughty. It’s taboo.|Shut the book!
Hey!|Hey!
So?!|So?
It’s Thursday! How was the audition?!|Wh? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when huh what? Thurs—
Well that thing is clearing in the way! All right. Ah-ha!  Ah-ah!! Damn fridge!|Hi Joey, how ya doin’?
Great! Roomie!|Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.
Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.|I’m not paying for half of that! I’m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.
Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya’?|That refrigerators don’t live as long as people.
All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I’ll take a check for the other hundred.|You’re jokin’ right?
Of course I’m jokin’! I don’t take checks.|Thank God you’re pretty.
Hey!|Hi! Hey!
Do you guys know any cute guys?|Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here.
Anyway, there’s this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go…|What’s the charity?
I don’t know, something either trees or disease—Ralph mumbles a lot.|Does Ralph mumble when you’re not paying attention?
Yeah! It’s weird. But the thing is need to find a date.|Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?
Well, someone that has his own tux, or has the ability to rent a tux.|So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
Oo! When’s her birthday?!|I don’t know Rachel, why?
Well, y’know it’s just been so long since I’ve been to Chuckie Cheese.|Oh, I like Elizabeth.
Chandler, do you think we talk about our relationship enough?|Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
Hey!|Okay, I just thought of the perfect guy for Rachel to take to her thing.
Rachel is not going to pick your stupid guy.|Oh yeah?
Yeah!|My guy is a lawyer who has volunteer work. And, he has one of these
Well, uh y’know, our guy works with Chandler and he’s really nice and smart and he’s a great dresser!|Have you seen your guy’s body?
You’re not supposed to look!|Oh yeah, like there are police for that!
All right fine, your guy may have a great body, but our guy is really funny.|Oh, Chandler funny?
Our guy’s a great dancer!|My guy is well read.
Hey.|Huh.
Well, you…don’t look good Joe.|The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?
That’s still in there?!|Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?
Is this a service you’re providing me?|No! No! No! For my new fridge—our new fridge!
Our new fridge? I don’t live here anymore.|So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.
Uh-huh.|And I got custody of the kid, right? Now suppose the kid dies and-and I gotta buy a new kid.
Okay…|Give me $400!
Professor Geller?|Hmm?  Oh, a student I don’t know.
I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment?|Yes, yes of course, what-what would this be regarding?
Making out in your office.|Shh!  Of course, why don’t we go inside?
What?|Doorknob! Doorknob!
Oh! Sorry! Umm, I actually do need to talk to you.|Oh, okay. What-what about?
Spring vacation.|Spring vacation.
Yeah, we have time off and a lot of people are going on trips…|Professor Geller!
You don’t understand! Elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her! Is that taking it slow?! No, I’m not ready for this! Okay? What-what do I tell her?|Just tell her the truth! Tell her you’re not ready.
I can do that. Oh-oh, what if she gets upset?|Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
What the hell are you doing?|What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!
What?! What? How do you, how do you even know its broken?!|Oh-ho-ho, you think I don’t know what breaks my fridge? Excuse me!  Well what do you know! Broken! That’ll be $400!
Joey, I did not break this! Okay?  That has been broken for a while.|All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?
Do not give him any money!|I’m not talking to you! You broke my fridge!
You wanted to see me Professor Geller?|Yes. Yes! Please, come in.
Doorknob?|Yeah, it kinda grows on you.  Actually, I wanted to finish talking to you about uh, spring vacation.
Oh good.|Look, I…  Look, I’m having a great time with you and I just don’t want us to move to fast or put to much pressure on us. So, I’m sorry I just don’t think we should go away together yet. It’s-it’s too soon.
Ross, I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I just wanted to tell you that I’m going to Florida for a couple weeks.|No. I think you misunderstood what I was saying. What I meant was…
You are so adorable.|That! Let’s talk about that.
Hey!|Hey!
Huh? Oh-oh, it was fine. Uh, it was just a misunderstanding. She didn’t want me to go with her. She just wanted to let me know that she’s going to Florida for spring vacation.|Wait a minute, is she going for spring vacation or is she going for spring break?
What’s-what’s the difference?|Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break you’re doing frat guys.
Hey, y’know what? Not all spring breaks are like that.|What did you do on yours?
I went to Egypt with my dad.|I can see it now, "Look dad, it’s the Sphinx!"
Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!"  All right? I mean she’s taken my class!|And slept with the professor.
I’m gonna call her.|Yeah.
I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!|Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A cat’s name?
All right.|Okay, so you will meet our guys?
Yes, I’ll meet ‘em.|Okay now it doesn’t matter which one you choose, y’know? It’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.
I’m so glad you’re going on this trip!|Yeah! I’ve been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy y’know, blow off some steam.
Sure. Sure. Look I don’t, I don’t know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.|What?
Are you into crafts at all?|Ross, are you okay?
Well, yeah, of-of course I’m okay! What? I’m just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and|It’s a bathing suit?
To wear in front of people?|Is that supportive?
Hey!|Good-good-good-good.
We’re really glad you decided to meet our guy.|Oh…
You’re gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?|I don’t know. I know I don’t work late tomorrow night.
Eldad, this is Rachel.|How are you?
Okay! Okay! We can take a hint!  What are you doing here?!|This is Patrick.
No! You can’t do that!|Maybe I should go!
Sit down! We’re winning!|Okay, y’know what? Maybe I should go!
Rachel! Rachel! You haven’t touched Eldad’s hair!|It is the softest hair! Touch it!
That’s right Patrick, bye-bye!|You dance for Rachel!
So uh, have a great time down there.|I will.
Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?|Yeah.
It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because it’s revealing which I’m fine with, no I’m concerned about your health, sun exposure.|Oh, don’t worry I have plenty of sun block, it’s SPF-30.
Well, if what’s in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes it’s-it’s get 4, and I swear to God more often than not it’s just milk.|Ross, it’s going to be okay. I’m not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.
Really?|Yeah! I’m just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.
Okay. Cool.|Oh hey! Here they are!
Rachel, we’re sorry for pushing those guys on you.|Oh that’s all right! Y’know, I ended up having a really good time. Y’know, the charity was a big success and they raised a lot of money and awareness.
Oh my God, look! That’s Elizabeth!|Oh-oh Professor Geller.
The reactor’s gonna blow in three seconds, we’re never gonna make it!|You’ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!
No! I won’t leave you!|Don’t worry about me, I’m a robot! I’m just a machine!!
No you’re not! Not to me!|Oh my God.
What?|I am extremely talented!
Yeah, you’re great! Okay, let’s take it from…|No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.
Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.|Oh yeah, you’re solid. Yeah, you’re just no me.
Y’know what? I think that’s enough for now. Yeah. I don’t want to be over rehearsed.|You’ll see!! You’ll all see!!
So uh, what’s this thing you’re auditioning for?|Oh, it’s a new TV show. Yeah. I’m up for the part of Mac Macaveli or "Mac." Yeah, I’m a detective and I solve crimes with the help of my robot partner. He’s a, he’s a Computerized Humanoid Electronically Enhanced Secret Enforcer or-or "C.H.E.E.S.E."
That is lucky.|Huh—Wait so Joey if you get this, you’re gonna be like the star of your own TV show! I mean you’ll be like the Big Cheese!  Or the Big Mac—Hey! You love those!
Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?|I mean come on you guys! My own TV show? I just don’t know if I’m good enough.
Whoa, she's pretty.|Yeah, and oh she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.
Oh, ok.|
I play Al Pacino's butt. All right? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.|Oh my God.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!|Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!|You're right, you're right, it is.
All right well, I’m outta here. Wish me luck.|Gooood luck! Gooood luck! We all wish you good luuuuuuuuck!!!
It’s your turn.|Oh, are we playing this?!
Wait a minute, are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn’t go well but it really did go well?|Yeah, did I fool ya?
Totally!|So it did go well.
Great!|Oh that’s great!
Wow!|And I know both of them, they’re really good. One of them is the guy from those allergy commercials who’s always getting chased by those big flowers…
Oh, I love that guy!|Oh-oh, what are you doing?
What am I doing?|I’m just so nervous! Y’know? The callback isn’t until tomorrow at five. I feel like my head is going to explode!
Look, don’t worry. Okay? You’re gonna be fine.|There’s just so much pressure. I mean no offense, but what you guys do is very different. I don’t know if you’d understand.
Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce.|Uh-huh. Is it dirty?
Oh-oh, no no don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.|Don't, I like it dirty.
That's your call.|So, uh, what are you going to do next?
Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos.|Are they, uh, firm?
They'r alright.|You sure they haven't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad?
No really, they're OK.|You gonna slice them up real nice?
Actually, I was gonna do them jullienne.|Aaaahhhhhhh.
Well, what happened?|Well, he came in for a massage and everything was fine until...
Was it...|Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under it!
You ate my sandwich?|It was a simple mistake. It could happen to anyone.
Oh-oh really?|Now-now calm down. Come look in my office, some of it my still be in the trash.
What?|Well, it was quite large. I-I-I-I-I had to throw most of it away.
Oh come on guys, it’s not like I moved to Europe! I just moved across the hall! And we would have you over all the time if it weren’t for|Ahh! Aren’t you dressed yet?
Am I naked again?!|We’re supposed to meet my parents in 15 minutes.
Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?|Wh?! What about my allergies?!
Yes!! Ha-ha!! All right! Hey! How cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-sized version of this? Huh? I mean how crazy would that be?|As crazy as soccer?
|You mean you didn’t get it from this?
The allergy guy got the part! Thanks!|Well, maybe we can fix it y’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!
How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could’ve turned my whole career around!|I messed up. Okay? I’m sorry, I really messed up.
Hey, you don’t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone? I have my machine!|Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybody’s allowed one mistake, right?
You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller!  The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!|It's not that bad.
Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]|Chandler, Chandler.
Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and…|And what?! Did you sleep with her?!
No! No! No! I just kissed her.|What?!! That’s even worse!!
How is that worse?!|I don’t know! But it’s the same!
You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.|Over the line?! You-you’re-you’re so far past the line, that you-you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!
Look, I’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you’re not perfect! You’ve made some errors in judgment too!|Name one!
What happened?!!|Awww, man! He promised he wouldn’t take the chairs!!
What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!|Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn’t think big enough to fit a grown man!
So--You got in voluntarily?!|I was tryin’ to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I’m gonna do?
Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.|Hi, Joey.  Well well, look what you brought.
...And what did you bring?|She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Janice?!|Oh.... my.... God.
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.|What?
Oh come on!  He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...|What?
Cupping.|That's how they do pants!  Ross, will you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
I can’t believe I did this! What an idiot!|Oh, stop beating yourself up! People make mistakes! These things happen! There aren’t any message you’ve forgotten to give me are there?  Apparently you’re not very good at it! I…
Do you think he’ll ever forgive me?|Of course he will! But Chandler the most important thing is you forgive yourself!
Y’know what? I-I kinda have.|Already? That’s pretty bad what you did.
You didn’t see how mad he was, y’know?|I’m sure he will forgive you. Look, we have all been there! Y’know, you fight, you make up, it’s just the way it works.
It took two people to break up this relationship!!|Yeah! You and that girl from that copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!!
I didn’t know what I was taking full responsibility for! Okay?! I didn’t finish the whole letter!|What?!!
I fell asleep!|You fell asleep?!
It was 5:30 in the morning, and you had rambled on for 18 pages. Front and back!!  Oh-oh-oh, and by the way, Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E means ‘you are,’ Y-O-U-R means ‘your!’|Y'know I can’t believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
|And hey! Just so you know, it’s not that common! It doesn’t happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!
You had no right to go out with him.|That is the most ridiculous...
You sold me out.|I did not sell you out.
Yes you did.  You absolutely sold me...|Would you let me talk. [flicks Monica on the forehead]
Did you just flick me?|OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus- [Monica flicks her back] Ow. That hurt [flicks Monica]
Fine!|There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches.
Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.|Oh my God!
Hey!|Please tell me you got the message!
What message?|The actor playing Mac couldn’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 o’clock.
What?! It’s 6 o’clock!|Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to Ross’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!
I can’t believe this Chandler!|Sorry! I-I-I don’t know what to say.
Well you-you-you-you might say congratulations! I saw the board! I went to the audition! I got the part!!|Is that supposed to be funny! I was really worried over here!
Oh, well I’m uh…|Y’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!
Oh wow! Okay man, I’m sorry. I did not mean to make you feel bad.|Well that’s good. Because you didn’t! And I’m incredibly happy for ya!!
That’s mean! You really had me going there!|Oh, we could do this all day.
Yeah, you’re right. Okay look, listen, let’s talk about what a huge star I’m gonna be!|You are gonna be a huge star! I’m gonna hug ya!
You hug me!|All right!
Hey, do we do this too much?|I think so. Yeah, get off me.
Come on C.H.E.E.S.E., I’m not leaving without you! Try routing your backup source through your primary CPU.|I can’t! My circuits are fried! They’re fried I tell you!!
Wow!  Well then I’ll just have to carry you.|That’ll be a neat trick, when you’re,  when you’re dead!
Ross, you don’t have to yell.|There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
Y’know what? I think that’s enough for today. Thanks for your help!|He’s holding us back.
Okay, Chandler!|Okay.
And your horoscope says, "On the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift."|
Op, but the twelfth brings a lover’s spat.|You are going to make a joke about my special present! Why would you do that?!
Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.|Hey guys!
Oh my God! It’s Joey Tribbiani of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!!!!!!|Oh that’s right. It’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
Are you judging them by their covers? Because you’re really not supposed to do that.|No, I’m just deciding which one to use—I’m gonna start writing another book!
Hey!|Hey!
Wait a minute, hold the phone! You’re not Elizabeth’s dad?!|Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me. It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
So uh, here’s your office set!|Wow! Huh?  Mac Macaveli, Private Investigator!
Let’s get you into wardrobe for a fitting.|Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?
I’m sorry, why don’t we do that right now? He’s right here.|Okay.
Joey Tribbiani, this is…|Oh wow! He’s so lifelike!  Unbelievable! (He starts tugging on the guy’s ears.
This is Wayne, the man who created and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.|
I’ll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?|Okay. Sorry about that… Uh, so where’s C.H.E.E.S.E.?
This is my father, Paul Stevens. Dad, this is Ross Geller.|It-it’s great to meet you Paul.
Daddy!|Fine! Two minutes. Go.
So uh, Monica is Ross’s sister.|And he’s a great brother!
Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby.|No, you said the baby creeps you out.
No, the little girl creeps me out.|You said the baby.
Why would the baby creep me out?|Why would the little girl creep you out?
This is going in your book?|Yeah, it’s about relationships. Y’know? The traps, the pitfalls, what not to do, keep going. This stuff is great!
Oh hi!|Hi! Hi.  I think I left my keys here somewhere.
Oh! Well let’s look for them.  Oh-oh-hey! Are these them?|No.
All right!|Oh, here they are right here.
Oh good.|Thanks for your help.
Oh, wait! Sorry, Mr. Paul? Mr. Paul?|Just call me Paul.
Paul. Umm, I just wanted you to know that Ross really is a great guy.|Well maybe you can date him then that would save me the trouble of killing him.  Are you okay?
You just don’t look old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter.|Well, we were very young when we had her.
Oh. We?|Well yeah, it usually, it takes two people to…
Oh no! Yes! Of course, I know that! I just—I meant y’know are you still a ‘We’ or are you just ‘You?’|I’m just me, my wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.
Ohh. So you raised her all on your own?|Yes I did.
Hey!|Hey!
Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.|Damn those robots, they’re supposed to be our faithful servants!
Anyway, it wasn’t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn’t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!|Well, why don’t you just get him fired?
I may have to, I hate to do it, but I’m the star! Y’know? There’s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.  Joey Tribbiani.|Joe! I’m glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!
Wow!|The thing is it’s kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn’t know he might be fired. It’s the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.
I’m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!|Uh-oh!
Joey?!|Hi Ross.
Joey?! Joey!!|Ross, Joey is not here.
Okay, I’ll just wait for him in here!|Ross, it’s okay. You can come out.
Oh! Oh my God! I didn’t even see you!|Sure you did! You came in, you got all awkward, and you ran into the bedroom. You were shouting, "Joey! Joey!" Bye Rach.
What-what-what the—how da-how did-what the-how did-what?!|Well, y’know he lost his keys so he was looking for them…
In your mouth?!|No! Downstairs! And we got to talking y’know, for like two hours, and I really liked him so I invited him up here for a cup of coffee.
You were at the coffeehouse!|Ross, what’s the big deal? So I kissed the guy!
He is my girlfriend’s father, okay? It’s-it’s, it’s weird!|Wh—You dated my sister!
That was different!|What? Why?!
This is weird for me!|Ross look, look this is good for you. Okay? Let’s face it, so far the guy’s not lovin’ ya! But I can turn that around! I got the inside track! We can all go out to dinner, y’know? And I can talk you up! Ross, the guy is a very, very successful lawyer!
How is that important?|Oh it’s important!
Apparently, there’s like a million guys out there that can play Mac, and there’s only this one robot and this one guy who controls it! I didn’t know he could get me fired! What am I going to do?|Well y’know Joey, you’re a pretty charming guy.
Thanks, but I kinda have a problem to deal with here.|No sweetie, you’ve got to win over the guy that controls C.H.E.E.S.E.! You’ve got to kiss some serious robot ass!
That’s not a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, but if I got to turn on the charm tomorrow I’m not wasting anymore of it over here with you guys.|So do you think uh, Joey’s more charming than me?
Morning! Hey, how’s my favorite genius and my little robot buddy?!|Don’t touch him!
So it seemed that my prom date had stood me up, so Ross selflessly, offered to take me.|What a nice story!
Wow! I definitely did not see that one backfiring! I’m gonna go to the bathroom.|Yeah, take your time.
Oh we were, but that was just a , I mean that was just a big drunken mistake.|You’re back.
Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.|We said seven!
We said six!|The only way that I said six would be if the seven’s, let meet at seven, not at six.
Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would’ve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriend’s such a wise ass—seven!"|Hi!
Ugh!|I know what time you said.
What time?|Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly it’s my book to the rescue, huh?  Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.
Inside of telling us you decided to write in your stupid book!|Marcia and Chester are mad at Phyllis.
I can’t believe I’m going to lose this job!|Oh I’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
Yeah! Help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.|Hey Joey, I want to talk to you.
Yeah? Well, I don’t want to talk to you Wayne! I hate you! You ruined my life! Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.|Hi, how are ya?
Why should I help you?!|The reason he just said.
What do you need?|I-I-I saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman, y’know Sarah?
Yeah?|I wish I could talk to her.
What are you in love with her or something?|Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.
I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.|How to make the next one even shorter?
Now wait a minute that’s not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didn’t tell me.|Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?
Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!|That’s okay Rach, we’re not liking Ross right now.
Well, it turns out you were right C.H.E.E.S.E.|The shipment never made it through Omaha?
You got it! And the rabbi’s beard, 100% horsehair. Nice catch C.H.E.E.S.E.!  Wayne! Wayne!!|Sherry Bilsing & Ellen Plummer
Hi, you guys.|Hey!
Well it’s just—it’s one of those situations that I just hate. Y’know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.|Now you’re thinking you gotta sleep with him.
No! No! It’s just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!|I’ll give up my ticket.
Okay that’s so generous!|And I think Ross is generous too.
Great! Okay then it’s just us girls!|Great.
Yeah.|So what-what is the exhibit.
It’s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.|Oh man!
Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!|I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin’ up about something… Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he’s just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I’ll…
Yeah I know; we’d be great together!|Hey! So I’m back.
Oh, I love museums!|Umm.
Soakin’ up all the culture.|Yeah.
Where do you want to start?|Ooh, the gift shop!
Yeah!|Hey, and then lunch.
This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn’t put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there!|May I help you?
What?! Are you crazy?! I’m not getting married! I’m not even engaged.|Yeah, but there’s a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That’s four years. Chandler’s not gonna wait that long. He’s gonna find somebody else, y’know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.|I’m gonna do it too!
Phoebe, that stuff is…|Don’t even get me started on yours!
Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?|I did.
All right, let’s get me back up there!|No! It don’t go up on the wall!
What—But you saw the show!|Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
Dry cleaners?|Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!|That’s right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that’s offensive to Russians.|I’ve never seen it!
This place is really beautiful!|Yeah, I’ve been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma’s.
Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes—Do-do you want to make out?|Sure!
Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.|Well, whatever works for ya…
No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.|Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it’s kinda fun hiding.
Yeah.|Hey umm, you brought protection right?
Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.|I’ll just run to the store and get some.
Oh no! Hey-hey, I’m the guy! I’ll get it.|Do you know where the store is?
No.|Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
A little bit.|I’ll be back in ten minutes.
Okay.|Why don’t you get in the hot tub and I’ll meet you there.
Ohh, okay.|Oh my God, what a great surprise! This is such a beautiful house.
Yeah we are.|
It’s so secluded up here.|I know. I like it up here.
I feel like we’re the only two people in the world.|What’s the matter honey? Did you see a little mouse?
No-no! Big bear! Big bear outside! I think I-I—would you—actually, would you go check on that?|Honey, we don’t have any bears here.
Well, okay. Would-would you get me a Diet Coke?|Okay. I’ll be right back.
Okay.  What?! What are you doing here?!|What are you doing here?!
I came with Paul!|Yeah, I recognize the ankles!
Get up!|
Ahh. Thank you!|Diet Coke.
Op, ice. I need ice.|Okay.
Thank you.|I’ll be right back.
Ugh! Get out! Get out! Go! Come on!|Did you really hear a bear?
Go-go!|Here you go honey. One Diet Coke with ice.
Ohh, thank you.|I’m so happy that you’re here.
Well, she-she ob-obviously saw the tire tracks that were leading up to the closed garage.|Obviously.
Did-did you come up here to work on that term paper or something?|Yeah! Yep.
Well, why do y’know go in that room  and do your homework?|Ohh, I wouldn’t do it in there. That’s my dad’s bedroom.
That’s your, that’s your dad’s bedroom.  That’s your dad’s bedroom!|Why are you yelling?
Hi, honey.|
What? I-I bought groceries, I was gonna make you dinner!|
Oh no!|I want to let her know that there was a cancellation and if she’s still interested in having the Bing-Geller wedding at our facility, it is available…
Oh please, he didn’t hear it! He didn’t hear it!!|
Can I help you?|Uh yeah, where-where’s the guy who decides who’s pictures go up on the wall?
He’s not here right now.|Oh, you’re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay? I’m an actor; I’m kinda getting my picture up there on the wall.
Y’know, there are two people who could put your picture up there.|Oh really? Well, maybe you and I go out for drinks?
So Lizzie, are-are-are you planning on staying the night?|Oh no-no believe me, I’m leaving as soon as possible!
Good. Good. Not that we don’t want you to stay, obviously you’re welcome—How much more homework do you have?|Ahh, I just have one problem left that I do not know how to solve. Uhh, Rachel maybe you want to come upstairs and help me figure it out?
What do you need from the car?|Surprise me.
|So you’re gonna be in the car, I will be upstairs, and that’s where everybody’s gonna be!
Phoebe!|Yeah?
Have you seen Chandler?!|No! Why?
The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!  I know! How bad is this?!|Well for the regular guy, it’s bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!
I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can’t find him anywhere!|What are you gonna do?
Well, I’m never gonna listen to you again, that’s for sure!  "Y’know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"|Rachel said that!
Oh! Here it is!|I didn’t do that! Who would’ve done that?!
Okay, maybe ask this guy.|You, get out of my shop!
Well, what did he do?|He went out with my wife!
Joey!|Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, I-I—Hey! I did not go out with your wife!
Well, we should go.|Yeah.
Ross? Ross?|Elizabeth!  I’ll meet you at the front door. Just tell them you’re going home, okay?
Okay!|Oh wait-wait-wait!! No! Don’t go in there! Don’t go in there! I need another soda!
Daddy!|You’re next!!
Okay. I didn’t know he was here.|Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I’ll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
I’m so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.|I’m not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what’s the harm in that?|Right here!
Chandler, please don’t think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel…|Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
It was a mistake. Please don’t take this to mean anything, because it doesn’t.|Okay.
Really?|Yes, if it really doesn’t mean anything, because you know that I’m just not ready…
I know! I know.|Okay.
I’m gonna go tell Joey that|Hey, did she buy it?
Hey Gunther.|Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there  wants the biscotti.
Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.|Do you still work here?
No! No, I quit a long time ago.  Did I forget to you that one? I’m sorry.|Oh that’s cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can’t figure this out! It’s so hard! Should I get her a  Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a—ah-ah! Paper cut!|Now, have you told anyone else?
No, I don’t want to tell anybody else because I don’t want Monica to find out.|You told me.
Well, it’s because I trust you, you’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.|Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn’t been on the toilet.
Me too.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
Oh all right.|Yeah, coffeehouse.
Oh well, we don’t because we got…the…other pl-place.|How rude.
So how are things going with Paul?|Good. Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy. Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.|So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.|Hi honey.
Watch this.|How are you?
Hi Paul!|Hi Phoebe.
So how are things going with you?|Can’t complain.
Yeah! That was so weird, huh?|Phoebe, why’d you do it?
I didn’t do it! It was Chandler! He’s… He’s mad at you!|What?! Why?!
Please, I think you know why.|I can’t think of anything.
Come on Ross, you’re a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.|Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn’t invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
Do you think that’s something that he’d be mad at you for?|I guess it could.
Well then I think that’s it.|Well, if he’s angry, he really shouldn’t just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?|Yeah that’s great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
It was fine.|Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
I’m thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.|Yeah that’s great Paul, but y’know I wanna know what——Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y’know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
Are you talking about having sex?|No Paul, I don’t know anything about you! Y’know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
Normal.|Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that’s always a painful time! Y’know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you’re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
Nope! That never happened to me!|Well, you’re lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm… The rest of you life, y’know? Any regrets?
Nope.|All right Paul, I’m not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
Okay.|Okay.
When I was six years old.|Hm-mmm.
I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.|That’s-that’s great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let’s go.
It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.|Oh!
And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn’t really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here  you can see it.|Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y’know, you shared your feelings. It’s really, it’s beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
Oh, I couldn’t eat now.|What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
Chicken?  Chicken boy!|My God, I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do that! I wouldn’t do that!
Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we’ve been too and I can’t find the perfect ring!|Okay, so maybe you don’t get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y’know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y’know? Or an engagement tiara? Or—ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
Y’know, I’m so glad I picked you to help me with this.|Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
Yeah, I’m gonna stick with the ring.  I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?|Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.|Or not, whatever.
Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?|Okay.  Will you marry me?
Oh my God that’s it, that’s the ring! How much is it?|Chandler, I-I will handle this!  How much is it?
Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.|Okay, I can let it go at eight.
Uh, credit card.  Okay, I’ll go get it. You guard the ring.|Okay.  Listen, I’m sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?|No.
Remember? You-you were eating pizza.|Yeah.
Okay. Well, apparently Chandler’s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.|Oh, we’re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y’know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.|Oh wow that’s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
Oh.|Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go.  Y’know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just—I don’t get Chandler. Y’know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don’t get all upset.
All the time?|All the time!
Oh my God! Oh my God!!|Still crying?
Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn’t know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!|Y’know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
What’s the other one?|I don’t know, I’ve never had to use the other one. I’m just saying y’know, if we’re having sex, he’s not gonna be talking.
Oh that’s right. You’re the talker.  Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.|Oh, we have some…
Okay umm, I’d also like to try on the tiara.  What do you think, too much?|A tad.
Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again.  Something’s missing. It’s not… Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.|Where’s the 1920s princess cut ring.
Rachel?|No. How are ya Paul?
Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?|No, did he hug you?!
No! No! It’s just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.|Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
Hey Chandler?|Yeah?
Would you…….Would you hug me?|I’m a little busy here Paul.
That’s exactly what my dad used to say!|Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out.
Five more seconds.|Okay!
Joey!|Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!
Chandler, I found the perfect ring.|Oh, that’s uh, that’s pretty nice but I’m gonna go with the one I picked first.
Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It’s over!|What?
Some guy bought it. I’m sorry. I tired to stop it but they  put me in jail!|They put you in jail?
The little jail between the doors!|Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
I know, I’m sorry! But y’know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.|Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
Maybe it was the guy.|It was the ring!
Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?|No! He blew us off!
What?!|I know!
I can’t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I’m a little mad at him now.|Can I tell you something? Me too.
Y’know what? He didn’t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don’t talk to him at all!|Ooooh! Freeze him out.
That’s right!|I like it!
Eh? We’ll show him!|From now on, it’s gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends.  Okay! We’re gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
Hi. I’m back.|Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I’ve written it all down!
Ah that’s great. No actually that’s…  That’s great! That’s really great! Y’know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.|Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this!  Y’know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
A lover?|A surfer.
Oh yeah surfer?|I wanted to be one with the waves, y’know?
Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh,  get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn’t too revealing is it?|So full of dreams…
I don’t care about the little dude! I can’t! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y’know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it’s only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could’ve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!|What?! I can’t believe you’re trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
Oh… I’m sorry. I… I-I don’t mean—I didn’t mean to stifle you. I… This is all just a little overwhelming.|Oh Rachel, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to overwhelm you. It’s just that, when those gates open, you…  Hard to close ‘em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
I’m so glad, I’m so glad you shared.|I would really like that.
Hey.|I can’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
It’s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It’s a beautiful ring!|No, it’s not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica’s face when I gave it to her, y’know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye.  Look, this is the most important thing I’m gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it’s perfect.
Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. ‘Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.|I can’t do that.
There he is!|Okay and he hasn’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
Wow! You’re good! After this, we should solve crimes.|Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
Oh, okay.  Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.|Who is it?
It is your office.|Do you know who at my office?
John?|Oh John! Great!
Here he is.|Ew.
Wow! I would trade.|It is beautiful, but I’m gonna use this one. Now, if you’ll excuse me.
Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman’s heart?|You’re dying?!
Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I’m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity…|Okay, that’s enough honey!
Guys?  I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.|I think we gotta end the freeze out.
Yeah, check out the ring.|Oh my God!!
Yep, pretty much.|You-you’re gonna get married?! I mean… We’re gonna be brothers-in-law!
Heyyyy—What?|Oh it’s water under the bridge, forget it!
Okay!  I was gonna wait ‘til uh, it was official y’know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you’re my best friends.|I think I’m gonna cry!
I’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.|Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!!  You guys are gonna be so happy!
I know.|
Check out the ring.|Nice! One and a half carat easy.
Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right?|Shana Goldberg-Meehan & Scott Silveri
God that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!|Yeah? Well, you should know. You’ve bought like a billion of ‘em.
Yeah, you didn’t get one.|Okay, well tonight’s the big night.
Hey!|Hey!
Are any of you guys free tonight? My boss is hosting this charity event for underprivileged kids and the more people I bring, the better I look. So, Monica? Chandler?|Well, Monica and Chandler can’t go. We’re going to dinner remember?!
Oh my God, I’m so sorry.|What’s the big deal?
How about you guys?|Open bar?
I think so.|I can do that for the kids.
Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?|Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
Will you marry me? Will you marry me?  What’s going on little elves?|It’s the big night! We wanted to wish you good luck!
Yeah, right here in my pocket.  Pheebs?|Oh! Oop!
Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and she’s gonna know.|Yeah-yeah you guys. Get out of here!
You are beautiful.|Oh, thank you!  What’s going on?
Here.|Oh! Thank you!
So now what’s going on here?|Uh well, uh this is a silent auction. They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair?|Uh, wh-why?
No! It’s nice!|Nice to see you Rachel.
Oh, hi.|And I also brought my friend Joey…
Shut the door! Shut the door!!|What’s-what’s going on?
Our next item is the romantic trip to Paris.  It goes to Emil Alexander high a high bid of 2,300.|Ugh! So close!
And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman’s day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!|I won! That was my guess!
Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!|Joey! Sit down!
What are you doing?|
Are you okay?|Yes! Yes! I’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything—are you—are you perrr-perfect?!
Yeah. I’m okay. I’m actually—I’m a little cold, can I have your jacket?|Oh, yeah.  Uh, no you can’t have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
Are you sure you’re okay?|Yes! I’m fine. In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
Ohh that’s sweet!|Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…
Oh my God!|I know, but just let me say it.
Oh my God, Richard.|What?! I’m Chandler!  Oh, that’s Richard!
Oh God, maybe he won’t see us. Richard!|Monica! Chandler!
Hey, it’s good to see you!|You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
Yeah—Oh that’s right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.|Well, my nose got lonely.
Chandler, wh-why don’t we sit down?|Yeah, I’ll sit down.
It’s good to see you|You’re table’s ready sir.
What were you thinking?!|I didn’t know it was an auction!
Wh?!|I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
Why would a charity give away a free boat?!|I don’t know! Charity?
Ugh!|Well, just buy the damn boat!
Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?|I’m just helping the kids!
How is you drinking helping the kids?|Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
Joey! Joey, good one!|That’s good. Very good!
Hey! You…can’t…leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!|Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don’t have that kind of money!
I know. Okay.  Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we’re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you’re just gonna pay the difference.|Okay.
Okay.|Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y’know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
And so, we’re hiding in the bathroom.|And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.|Oh my God!
Ohh.|What?!
Oh my God, you guys!!|Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
Who?|Richard!
What?  Ohh. Oh that’s right that’s right. That’s Richard’s favorite place too.|Oh you knew that. Good!
Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.|Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!
Y’know, maybe she is too young for me. Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don’t know what to do.|Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that’s what I did when I first  weighing stuff.
Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.|If the school finds out you’re fired.
Hmm.|She’s leaving for three months.
Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…|Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?  Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn’t you?!
No! No! I…didn’t do that. It’s just… Okay, honestly no. I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her.|Okay well I think…that’s your answer.
I’ve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.|Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!
Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.|Oh great!
Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.|Oh, okay.
Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?|That’s me.
Ahh, yes.|Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
You-you have to pay that! It’s not just a guess.|
Are you kidding me?! She’s gonna this boat!|Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife’s name?
Aw-awww!|I don’t think she’d like that.
Oooooh…|I don’t think so dear.
No way! It’s mine!!|What?! What?!
All that stuff you just said? I want that!|But Joey you don’t have $20,000!
Oh my God, you’re back!|Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
Yeah.|Eww! Oh, it’s all dirty. You should throw this out.
What?! Noooo…|I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!
We didn’t ruin it!|Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
Glove salesman!|Good one! Yeah.
Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!|I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
That guy’s still doing that?!|Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand!!
Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn’t seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?|Ross! Wait!
Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about…|You suck!!
Okay, okay, here she comes!  How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?|Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy.  I never noticed that before.
Hey!|What are you up too?
Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.|Yeah, Big Brother.
Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?|Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
Eh…|Okay well that’s good to know.
Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?|Sure, I love this part!
Come on in.|Hi!
What uh—What did you—What?!|I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!|Well yeah, I’m sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
Oh God…  Why don’t they put chairs back here?!|I know this is crazy but am I too late?
What the… Yes you’re too late! Where was all this three years ago?!|Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
What were you doing in Africa?|Working with blind kids.
Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.|Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away. And I’ll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler’s willing to give you everything I am.
Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!|You are?
Yeah!|Why?
Isn’t it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.|I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.
Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?|Not that often!
No! I’m so happy for them!|Me too! So happy for them!
I’m so happy and not at all jealous.|Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
I mean I’m probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what’s 2%? That’s nothing.|Totally. I’m like 90/10.
Yeah me too.|Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don’t really believe that do you?|Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!|If marriage worked, I’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?|Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.
Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!|Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!
Y’know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!|It’s okay, I got a plan.
We’re gonna find love!|Definitely!
Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that. That’s what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.|What do you mean?
Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.|You mean a backup?
Exactly!|Yeah, yeah I got that.
You do?|Hm-mmm.
Who?|Joey.
Joey?!|Yeah!
Are you serious?!|Yeah, I locked him years ago!
Wh… So… If neither of you are married by the time you’re 40, you’re gonna marry Joey.|Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
Oh, seriously?|Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were…
Charming.|Well hey, it’s just a backup.
Hey Monica!|Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?|Yeah, it’s great.
Whoa-whoa, what’s the matter?! Talk to the captain!|I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!
Chandler giving you a hard time huh?|It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!
Well, you know Chandler.|No I don’t know Chandler! Not anymore! It’s like it’s like something’s changed.
Maybe you changed?|I didn’t change!
Maybe that’s the problem.|What?!
Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.|Is that some kind of boat talk?
I don’t know!  I haven’t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.|What does he think? Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?
Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!|Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.
There are?|Yeah! Richard!
R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandler’s tellin’ ya how much he hates marriage?!|That’s right.
Chandler loves marriage!!|You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife! That-that he’s against marriage and always will be!
When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.|What happened you guys?
Where the hell have you been?!|I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!|What?!
Yeah! Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!|My—Oh my God!
I know! They suck!!|He’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I’m supposed to do that!
I know!|Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna go over there; I’m gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?!
Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!|You’re right.
Yeah!|Okay.  I’m just going to propose!
Okay.|Okay great.
Dude-dude-dude!|What?!
Hi.|Hi.
I don’t know why I’m here.|I didn’t ask. You wanna come in?
I don’t know.|Oh, okay. Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
Chandler is such an idiot!|Drink?
Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…|…on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
Still smoking cigars?|Uh, no! No! That’s…art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
No that’s, that’s okay.|So Monica let me ask you a question. Y’know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.|Oh really?
Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.|Who is it?
Edward Nevski?|Yeah he’s no good. Do you ever  non-eye doctor way?
No.|Ahh.
Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!|Of course I can! It’s just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I’ve already lost Chandler!
What?!|Hey!
Phoebe you can’t have both of them! You have to pick one!|Pick me!!
Oh God, Phoebe!|I’m talking about massages.
Okay, y’know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we’re gonna do! I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin  and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?|Okay that’s fair.
Pick one.|Left!  Thank you.
You’re welcome.|Ross!
We should just switch.|Yeah absolutely!
I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!|Excuse me?
Oh!  Him.|Oh.  Whew!
I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up’s apartment! Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!|Yeah! You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that!|I think that’s fair.
Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!|It’s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey.  Shhhh.
Nothing.  I don’t kn—Umm. I don’t know. Umm…|I know.
Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know, some stuff before I can…|Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want.
Chandler.|Where is she? I’m not scared of you!
She’s not here and please come in.|Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
Okay, she was here, but she left.|Well where did she go?
Well she said she had to think things over.|Oh my God, I can’t believe this! Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.
Oh, hey look nothing happened.|Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?
Well all right, one thing happened?|Y’know what? I can’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
Well I’m sorry.|And what does she have to think about? I love her!
Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.|But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!
Well if it helps, it worked very well.|It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake!  I was gonna propose tonight.
You were gonna propose?|Yeah I even  Did you get a ring?
No I don’t have a ring!  And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don’t let her go. Trust me.|Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
Dude!|I can’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
She’s gone.|What?
She’s gone. She had a bag and she left.|What are you talking about?
She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.|Well why didn’t you stop her?! Why didn’t you just tell her it was a plan?!
I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn’t believe me.|Well where… Where did she go?
To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her. But if I were you I would.|I can’t believe I ruined this.
I am so sorry man.|You wanted it to be a surprise.
Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!|Come in! Come in!  We’re engaged!!!
Hey, what’s going on?|Hey.
I found a note on my door, "Come to Monica’s quick, bring champagne and a Three Musketeers bar."|Yeah I’ll take that.
What’s up?|Monica and I are engaged.
Oh my God.  Congratulations.|Thanks.
Yeah, she’s been out there for twenty minutes, I’m surprised you didn’t hear her on the way over.|Oh, I thought it was just a kid yelling, "I’m gay! I’m gay!" Can I bring her in?
Okay! Wait-wait-wait! Shhh!  Our special night. I mean it just wouldn’t be my—our-our night, if you all weren’t here to celebrate with me—us—Damnit!|It’s okay, I want this to be your night too.  To Monica.
Awww, come on—wait—stop it. Okay, to Monica.|To Monica!
Y’know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.|But I-I-I can’t stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I’m supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.  What?
Okay everybody, let’s go! Let’s go!|Okay.
|Know what I mean?
Yeah, but I don’t think we have time.|There’s gonna be a wedding. You’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!|
Phoebe!|If you would’ve let me finish, it goes on to say that he’s probably not gay.
Sure, you guys don’t have this problem, you’re made of wood.  Hey!|Hey!
You look great!|Oh, thanks.
You okay over there?|I don’t know, y’know? I feel a little umm… No, y’know what? Nevermind, I’m gonna be fine.
Hey!|Hi!
Wow! Happy Monica’s night!|Well thank you, you too.
Thanks.|Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?
Well sure. But I get married all the time so…|Ohh…
You okay?|Yeah, I guess. I-I… I mean, do-do you think we’re ever gonna have that?
You mean, we—you and me?|Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
Oh good, you scared me for a minute.|Shake it off.
I mean—no, it’s just ‘cause, it’s just ’cause you and I were like a nightmare.  No, but there was some good times.|No, absolutely. Y’know like it was umm…
Surely you can think of something good.|Yeah, just give me a minute!  Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
What?|Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?|Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
My hands?|Yeah.
Yeah?|Uh-huh.
Way to go guys. Y’know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.|Oh, I know. Hey, y’know what we never did?  We uh, we never had bonus night!
A what?|Y’know, bonus night. Y’know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?|Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
‘Sup? ‘Sup dude?|Take whatever you want, just please don’t hurt me.
So you’re playing a little Playstation, huh? That’s whack! Playstation is whack! ‘Sup with the whack Playstation, ‘sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!|Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
Come on man, really how old?!|Young! You’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
Wow thanks!|Joe?
Yeah!|Uhh, you’ve had a lot of sex right?
When? Today? Some, not a lot.|Well, it’s just the reason that I’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn’t…. There huh—hmm, there-there was an incident.
Don’t worry about that man, that happens.|It’s happened to you?
Yeah! Once.|Well, what’d you do?
Phoebe! Come on! Let’s go!  Why aren’t you dressed yet?!|I’m sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
No, Phoebe, I’ll tell you what, if you get ready now I’ll let you play it at the wedding.|Really?! Oh that’s so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I’ll have to pound on you for a little bit.
Fair enough, now go get ready!|Okay.
Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw…|Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
It is! It is!|No it’s not! No! No! Now it’s about you and Ross getting back together!
Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!|Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
Yeah!|That’s true.
It was just a kiss.|You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
Look let’s not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn’t even matter!|Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
Oh no!|No-no, it’s really not huge.
And; people thinking it’s huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder.  Which we are not!|Well, we’re still talking about it, aren’t we?
Okay, I think I’ll play it at the wedding.|Yeah! Well, I think we’ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don’t."
Well, I don’t think Monica is gonna take this away.|Wouldn’t she?
Would she?|Would she?  You ate my candy bar!
Guess who?|Hey.
Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air…|What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn’t want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
Still thinking about it huh?|Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that?  Especially you!
Oh, who cares?|I care!
And so do I.|Y’know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
Okay. Sure.|Am I going to let you watch me undress?
I can’t believe her, y’know it’s just—it’s so typical.|Now Monica, I know you’re upset, but don’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
Paris?|We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la .
Keep talking.|Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it’s romantic, but because I can!
Bonjour, monsieur.|Okay, don’t say anything, you might scare it away.
|Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I’m just gonna need a small deposit.
What?!|Y’know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
They break your heart, don’t they?|Y’know, I don’t really their permission.
Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!|Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you… You gotta do something about your eyes.
What?! What’s wrong with my eyes.|They give you away! There’s just-there’s just too much wisdom in there.  Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
And that’ll get rid of my wisdom?|Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don’t care!|Yes.
What a great apology!  And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!|No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
Ahh, third base.|It’s all everybody at the party could talk about!
Why to save your dignity my man.|Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
Look uh, if we’re gonna do this…|We’re not gonna do this, all right? She’s just gonna think that we’re doin’ it.
Oh, I see, so everybody wins.|Who is it?
Oww!|Yeah, you like that baby?  May we help you?
Congratulations man.|Thanks.
And uh, Rachel.|Yeah.
|Hey! Here’s a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
Oh thank you.|Okay.
Hey!|Hi!
Who wants French toast?|Oh, I’ll have some!
Good, me too.  Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.|Oww!
And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let’s take a look at…|Hey! Ross!
Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?|I need to talk to you, it’s pretty urgent. It’s about Monica and Chandler.
Oh my God! Of course, of course.  Wh-what’s going on?|Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y’know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what’s wrong with Monica and Chandler?|Nothing—Why?!
Phoebe, you said it was urgent!|Oh yeah it is! I’m going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?|Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
All right, so I haven’t cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.|Okay.
All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.|Aw.
A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.|Well, you couldn’t get them anyway. Ian doesn’t plan anymore and Derrick…  And Derrick is a name I shouldn’t know.
Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!|Okay.
Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?|Centerpieces!
Yeah! Roses or Lilies?|Definitely roses.  But Lilies are the clear choice.
Oh my God! It’s like one mind.|Uh-huh!
Uh, Phoebe…|Oh Ross, hi.
Phoebe, what are you doing?|I’m sorry, I’m with a client right now.
Phoebe!|Okay, let’s talk outside.
Phoebe, you can’t massage people in my apartment!|What’s the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler’s!
And they knew about it?|Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!|Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don’t know what the big deal is!
Hey Joey, what ‘cha doing?|Sweepin’. Why? Turn you on?
No.|Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
Joey, did you my face cream?|Where are you going? The vicar won’t be home for hours.
Joey,  where did you learn that word?|Where do you think,  Zelda?
You found my book?!|Yeah I did!
Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!|Okay, look I’m sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn’t have, but you got porn!
Hey-hey, y’know what? I don’t care! I’m not ashamed of my book. There’s nothing with a woman enjoying a little…erotica. It’s just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.|You got porn!
Hello.|Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
Uh no-no, she-she’s out for the night.|Ohh great.
Can I, can I help you with something?|Well, I don’t know. Are you a masseur?
Yes I am.|Great!
So Chandler, you’re parents must’ve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.|Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
You don’t know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!|What a sweet story.
You tell her Jack, I can’t do it.|What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don’t you?
I don’t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!|We’re sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you’d pay for it yourself.
You bought the beach house when I was 23!|Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can’t put a price on that sweetie.
What about when I started dating Chandler?|Well it was Chandler! We didn’t think he’d ever propose!
I can’t believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!|We might still have some money, if your father didn’t think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
I can’t believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?|I don’t know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She’s saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  Dollywood.
My parents spent the money for our wedding!|My God! What did you order?!
No! No it’s not! It’s not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!|No, y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. I mean you don’t have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y’know? And-and you don’t need, you don’t need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
How? I don’t have any money.|Well, I have some.
How much?|Well, close to…
Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!|Well what?! How-how much is it?!
It’s enough for wedding scenario eight.|Ohh!  Really?!
How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!|Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
This is the most special day of our lives.|No, I realize that honey, but I’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
Honey, umm I-I love you,  Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we’re only gonna get married once.|Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
You-you’re gonna have to put your foot down?|Yes, I am!
Hey Rach.|Joey.
Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?|Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
No-no-no, I’m serious. You don’t smell it? Something’s on fire.|Well no, I don’t smell anything.
Oh, y’know what? It’s probably just your burnin’ loins.|Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?|His daughter was hot.
Hey.|Hey.
Listen umm, I’ve been thinking, it’s not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.|Ehh.
Eh, you work for that.|Look, I thought about it too, and I’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
You do?!|Yeah, I’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that’s what we’re gonna do.
Oh, you’re so sweet.  Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?|Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y’know? We’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
You thought about that?|Yeah.
How many kids were we gonna have?|Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
What else did you think about?|Well, stuff like where’d we live, y’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
Y’know what? I-I don’t want a big, fancy wedding.|Sure you do.
No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.|You sure?
Uh-hmm.|I love you so much.
I love you.  Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin’ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.|Oh yeah, totally!
Hello, Zelda.|Who are you supposed to be?
The vicar!|Do you even know what a vicar is?
Like a goalie, right?|Yeah. Look Joey, it’s enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it’s—I’m not—it’s just not funny anymore!
All right, I’m sorry. Rach I—Rach I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.|All right! Y’know what? That’s it! You wanna do it?! Let’s do it!
Huh?|That’s right, I wanna do it with you! I’ve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
|Yeah! Ohh, I’ve been waitin’ so long to get on that body!
This body?|Yeah that’s right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
Hey-hey, you’re startin’ to sound like the butcher’s wife there in-in chapter seven.|Oh, come on now, don’t keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you’re in for a rough ride!
Hey, you guys!|Hey!
So, what do you think?|About what?
Are you kidding? Okay, I’ll give you a hint; I’ll give you a hint.|Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandler’s eyes!
I got glasses!|Well, you-you’ve always had glasses.
No I didn’t!|Are you sure?
No!|Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.
Really?|Yeah!
You didn’t think I used to wear glasses, right?|Of course!
So what do you guys want for an engagement present?|That’s okay Pheebs, we’re not having a party or anything, so you don’t have to get us…
Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.|Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.
You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?|Uh-huh, yeah.
You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?|Dying people say the craziest things.
Break my heart—Oh, all right.|Okay. I’m gonna be the mom that makes the world’s best chocolate chip cookies.
If you don’t sail your boat, what do you do on it?|Oh, it’s great! It’s a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips.
Your own boat?|What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.
Do you know what I was thinkin’?|What?
Nothing, I just like to go like this.|Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
Uh why, do you have a lecture?|No, why?
Then free as a bird. What’s up?|My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.
Well, did-did you correct him?|No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.
Oh no problem, maybe I’ll play with my left hand.|You’re not a lefty?
Does anybody know me?!|What’s wrong Phoebe?
Don’t worry about it Pheebs.|No one got me an engagement present.
An old cookie?|This is what happens when you don’t register for gifts!
We can’t accept this.|Why not?
‘Cause it’s gross.|No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.
Okay, we owe you a present.|Two! I’ve been engaged twice!
Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?|That is the Coast Guard.
What are they doing out here? The coast’s all the way over there.|Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We’re not finished with the lesson yet.
All right.|Okay, I’m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?
Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let’s start sailing, and I want to go over there  Yo-ho-ho!|Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let’s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though,  what’s this called?
Uh, boat rope.|Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?
Uhh, rub it?|No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?
I’d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh…|Time’s up, now your dead.
And deaf!|Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?!
Yes.|Don’t just say yes! This isn’t a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!
All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.|You do?
You don’t?  Well, that’s the difference between a professional and a layman.|That and arrogance.
Hey! How was sailing?|I don’t want to talk about it. Y’know, you could’ve at least saved me a whole cookie.
Hey! How was it?|Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other hand…
Guys?|Over here.
Oh my God Chandler! I can’t believe it!|I know.
You gave my father a lap dance!|Why do they put so much steam in there?!
Listen, I’m sure that dad doesn’t care. He probably thought this was funny; he’ll be telling this story for years!|I don’t want him to tell this story for years.
I wasn’t escaping.|Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?
I was trying to help out a squirrel.|You were trying to eat it!
All right, I’m off to see your dad.|Whoa-whoa, aren’t you a little over dressed?
Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face—And by face I don’t mean his lap. And by face, I don’t mean my ass.|Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?
Okay, here’s batch 22. Ohh, maybe these’ll taste a little like your grandmother’s. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.|Let’s give it a shot.
Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.|Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?
No, just a Friday night.|Ohh, these are pretty good.
The ones we had right after you almost threw up.|Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16.  I’m okay.
Okay Joey honey, you’re doing really good! All right, now I’m just gonna need you to step to the port side.  Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?|Ohh yeah.
Right?|Nope.
It’s left sweetie, but that’s okay sweetie, that’s a tough one.|I don’t know why you just don’t say left.
Okay, go to the left.  The left!|Huh?
|Okay! Okay, you’re yelling again! See that?
No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.|Oh, y’know what? Since I’m here, I think I’m gonna have me a little beer on the port side.
Okay Joey, we’re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham?|Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn’t know there.
Joey, come on! We just went over this!|Oh, y’know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!
No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!|All right that’s it! You’re yelling and I don’t see you taking your top off! I quit!
What do you mean you quit?! You can’t quit!|Why not?!
Because you’re not finished yet and I won’t have it! Greens do not quit!|Greens? I’m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!
Oh my God, wait did I—I just said Greens don’t quit didn’t I?  Did I just say Greens don’t quit?!|Yes! Yes! You did and you’re still yelling at me!
No! No! No! I’m not yelling at you, I’m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I’m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I’ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin’. Oh, Joey, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.|Well, hey I did learn.
Really?|Yeah! Come on.
Awww…|Yeah, it’s okay. I know what a mainsail is.  I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.
Left.|Damnit!
Y’know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we’re trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she’s l-l-lookin’ up at us and smiling right now.|Looking up?
Oh yeah—No, she was really nice to me, but she’s in hell for sure.|Well, I’ve tried everything. I give up. I guess I’m not gonna be the mom who makes the world’s best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.
Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And that’s not happening ‘til October 15th, 2032.|That’s the day you’re gonna die? See—darnit, I’ve got shuffleboard that day.
That’s what you think.|Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmother’s? Wouldn’t they have the recipe?
Well, y’know I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.|What was her name?
Nesele Toulouse.|Nestle Tollhouse?!
Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.|
Ohh.|I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!
So you understand, I’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn’t tell people what happened. Y’know, I’m a little…I’m a little embarrassed about it.|I understand completely, there’s nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.
What did you do when they found out?|They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?
Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.|Yeah, yeah. Hey, why don’t you give a pull on that rope?
Ohh we’re not sailing.|Just pull on it.
All right.  Sandwiches!|What else?
Here you go.|Thank you.
Oh wow!|What are you doing?
Ohh, sorry.|What you—don’t hold it like that! You’re lettin’ all the good stuff fall out.
Ohh whoops.|Careful! You’re wasting good pastrami!  Oh my God! I’m my dad!
|You can say that again Mac.
Well, I couldn’t have done it without you buddy. You’re a genius.|Oh yeah? Well then how come I can’t get my VCR to stop blinking 12:00?
Phoebe, do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?|What? You mean behind my back?
Still get a discount on wedding dresses?|Yeah!
I’m so happy for you!|Well, these really are the days of our lives.
What?!|Well, since you ask. They want me back on Days of Our Lives!
Oooh!|I get to hire my own assistant!
And you were at this job for four years?|That’s right.
Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?|What?
I’ve never interviewed anyone before. I’ve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isn’t the same thing.|No dear. It’s not.
No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.|Thank you! Good meeting you.
All right.  I’m a total pro!|Hello?
Wow! H-umm! Hi! Yes, uh I’m sorry the models are actually down the hall.|Actually, I’m here about the assistant job.
Really?!  Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so what’s—what is—what’s your name?|Tag Jones.
Uh-huh, go on.|That’s it. That’s my whole name.
That’s your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well let’s-let’s just have a look-see here.|I know I haven’t worked in an office before, and I really don’t have a lot of experience, but uh…
Oh come on, what are you talking about? You’ve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Friday’s, come on!|It’s lame, I know. But I’m a goal-oriented person, very eager to learn…
No-no-no-no.|Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.
Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?|I can’t tell you. It’s a secret.
Secret? Married people aren’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.|Awww.  But still no.
No I’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.|Really? Okay, so why don’t you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?
Oh no-no, I can’t do that.|If you tell me, I’ll tell you what Phoebe said.
Okay.|Okay.
So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, we’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.|Oh my God. He threw up?
No, he visited a little town south of throw up.  So what was Phoebe’s secret?|Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebe’s old massage place is getting fired.
That’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?|That’s right! You lose sucker!!  Please still marry me.
Chandler, you have an assistant right?|Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!
No, I-I just don’t know how you decide who to hire. I mean I’ve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then there’s this guy…|What about him?
I love him. He’s so pretty I wanna cry! I don’t know what to do. Tell me what to do.|Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You don’t hire an assistant because they’re cute, you hire them because they’re qualified.
Uh-huh. No, I hear what you’re saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing?  Look how pretty!|Let’s see.
Okay you’re right. I’ll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!|Let me see this guy.  W-H-Wow! Don’t show this to Monica! And don’t tell her about the W-H-Wow!
Hey-hey-hey Joey!|Hey Terry!
Good to see you again!|It’s been a while, huh? Wow, it’s funny these halls look smaller then they used to.
It’s a different building.|So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?
Why don’t we start right now!|Okay.
Here are the audition scenes.|Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.
Why would you think that?|Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker’s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?
Everybody has to audition.|Y’know Terry, I-I don’t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series,  with a robot.
I’m sorry Joey that’s…that’s the way it is.|Well. I guess you think you’re pretty special huh? Sittin’ up here in your fancy small hall building. Makin’ stars jump through hoops for ya, huh? Well y’know what?  This is one star who’s hoop… This is a star that the hoop—this hoop—I was Dr. Drake Remoray!
Hi! Tag. What are you doing here?|I just wanted to come by and thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday. And I noticed there aren’t any plants in your office so I wanted to bring you your first…  There is a plant in your office.
Kinda.|Right. So I guess I shouldn’t put good at noticing stuff on my resume.
Oh-ohh, thank you.|Anyway, I’m guessing you hired somebody.
Well…|Gotcha. Thanks again for meeting with me.
But I hired you!|What?
Yeah! You-you got the job! You’re my new assistant!|I am?!
Yeah!|I can’t believe it!
Hey.|Hey! Good, you’re home!
Oh it’s always nicer to here than, "Aw crap! You again!"|Hey baby.
Hey.|I made you a surprise.
Oh yeah?|Yeah, tacos! Ever since you told me that story I’ve had such a craving for them.
Did you not understand the story?|Hey!
Hey! What’s up?|Ross!
Huh.|Hey—Ooh! What’s-what’s that, dinner stuff? You making dinner?
No!  Shhh!|What you got over there? Tacos?
Nancy Thompson’s getting fired!|Look, okay-okay I had food poisoning! It’s not like I choose to do it! It’s not like—It’s not like I said, "Umm, what would make this ride more fun?!"
I had too okay?! We’re getting married! Married couples can’t keep secrets from one another!|Oh really? Well I-I guess Monica should know about Atlantic City.
Du-ude!|What happened in Atlantic City?!
Did you not hear me say, "Du-ude?!"|And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay? So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing. Now, I know what you’re thinking, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you’re right, Chandler’s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with…girls.
In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.|Oh Mon, I laughed so hard…
Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?|Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
Hi!|Hey.
Ohh, my new assistant is working out, yes.|Was she happy you gave her the job?
Oh, my-my new assistant has very happy that I hired my new assistant.|They canceled Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E!
I’m sorry Joey.|Why would they do that?! It was a good show right?!
You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!|All right! All right! Chandler entered a Vanilla Ice look-a-like contest and won!
Ross came in forth and cried!|Oh my God!
Wow—whoa!|Chandler one time wore my underwear to work!
Hey!!!|Ohh, I’m sorry I couldn’t think of anymore for Ross!
That was you!|Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.
How could this happen to me?! Yesterday I had two TV shows! Today, I got nothin’!|Well wait a minute, what happened to Days of Our Lives?
Uh, well they might be a little mad at me over there.|What happened?
Well maybe I got a little upset and maybe I told them where they could go.|Joey, why would you do that?
Because they wanted me to audition!|You! An actor?! That’s madness!
Rachel Green’s office.|Tag?  Hi, who was that?
Nobody. I was just practicing.|Really?
Hi! Rachel Green’s office.|You must be Hilda.
Phoebe! That’s a great name.|Oh, you like that? You should hear my phone number.
Hey! Terry.|Joey Tribbiani! I’m surprised your big head could fit through our small halls!  I gotta go Joey.
Wait! Terry! Wait—Look—Wait I-I… Look, I’m really sorry about before. I was an idiot thinking I’m too big to audition for you. You gotta give me another chance.|I can’t help you Joey.
This poor guy’s been in a coma for five years. It’s hopeless.|It’s not hopeless! Dr. Stryker Remoray’s a miracle worker. Look, here he comes.
Y’know, in my defense, umm there was no glitter on the macaroni and very little glue.|And in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me!
No!|Quick! What time is it?!
I don’t know! Time to kiss a guy maybe?!|Y’know when I said that because we’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
Yeah?|Yeah that was stupid. Let’s not do that.
Ohh, absolutely.|And! We should keep all the stuff uh, we told each other secret from everybody else.
Yeah, definitely!|Okay,  if you’ll excuse me, I-I’m gonna go hang out with some people who don’t know the Space Mountain story.
Then, I’d steer clear of Phoebe.|Man!
|Do you have a minute?
Well yeah, sure, what’s up?|I got asked out twice today when I was at lunch…by guys.
Oh really?!|Yeah. Did you tell someone that I was gay?
Oh, did you not want people to know that?|But I’m not gay. And I especially wouldn’t want you to think I was gay.
Why’s that?|I don’t think I should say.
Ohh, you can say. Come on, I don’t want you to feel like you can’t tell me things.|Okay.
‘Kay.|Well…
Yeah.|I’d love to ask out your friend Phoebe.
Yeah, she’s gay.|Patty Lin
Hey.|What’s the matter?
Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!|Oh Willie’s still alive!
What are you guys doing?|Oh, my mom called, they’re gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we’re looking for a good picture of us.
Oooh, I’m afraid that does not exist.|That’s not true, there are great pictures of us!
No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who’s going like this…|Oh my God! That’s the creep that you’re with at the Statue of Liberty.
I don’t know what it is, I just can’t take a good picture.|Oh, here’s a great one.
Yeah, I’m not in that.|I know, but look at me all tan.
Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh…|How about those three pointers?
Amazing!|And those guys were this  close to lettin’ us play this time too.
Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.|Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
It’s not a club.|Phoebe, if this guy’s going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
Hey, divorced men are not bad men!|They have that on the napkins at the club.
Soon he’ll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.|I am not gonna get fired, because I’m not gonna act on it.
Maybe I should open a divorced men’s club.|Dude that is so sad.
I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.|Could I play?
Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?|I just did them.
Oh, well drop and give me ten more!|What?
Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?|Yeah, I filled them out last night?
Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?|Hey Rachel!
|Umm, is Tag here?
No. Why?|Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?|Well, we’ve been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain’t a locker room, okay? But, y’know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.|Oh no!
Oh yeah. All right, back to work.|Hey! Isn’t that Tag’s backpack.
Great! That’s great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?|Okay.
I’m sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?|No, I am.
Hi Joey! What are you doing here?|Uhh, well I’ve got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt.  You got an extra one?
Yeah, sure. Umm…here.|Great.  You got anything that’s not Ralph Lauren?
Yeah, I don’t think so Joe.|All right, I guess this will be fine.
Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?|Nothing, why?
How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I’ll pay.|Huh, Rach I got to say it’s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
I’m not asking you to go on a date with him!|Really? ‘Cause I could kinda use the money.
Joey, just-just he-he’s new in town and I know he doesn’t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I’ll really appreciate it.|Yeah, okay.
Yeah?|Sure, no problem.  Ooh—Hey, donuts!
Yeah!|Okay.
I know. Let’s try a look…of far off…wonderment. Okay, we’ll-we’ll gaze into our future and we’ll think about our marriage and the days to come.  Hey! Don’t laugh at him! He’s my drowning moron!|Aww!
I like this one.  It seems to say, "I love you and that’s why I have to kill you."|They can’t all be bad.  Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
Yeah?|Yeah, umm that’s Whitney , Kyle’s ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y’know divert her so that we can slip out?
What?! No!|Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
Hi Ginger.|All right! I want my key back!
I don’t have it!|It’s right there!
Ugh, okay Sherlock!|Look, I’m sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.
All right, well I just wanted to say thank you though for diverting Kyle’s ex.|Oh yeah—No—You’re welcome. We’ll talk about it later.
Okay.|Hi Whitney.
Kyle’s ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!|Hi! I’m sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
Watching ballroom dancing?|Yes! That’s where we realized we were both super cool people!
Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.|Like what?
Like she’s really mean, and she’s over critical, and-and—No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!|Okay.
And! She uses sex as a weapon!|Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I’ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
You’re still gonna go out with her?!|Yeah!
Well, didn’t you just hear what I said?!|Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband’s gonna say that stuff. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
No listen to me! She is crazy!|Uh, your door isn’t sound proof.
Good morning.|Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.|Ohh that’s nice.
Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!|Wo-women? You mean like old women?
Well kinda old, like 30.|Oh.
And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.|That’s great! Wow man, so Joey must’ve really taught you some stuff huh?
A little.|Yeah?
See? That’s a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera.  You’re changing it!|I can’t help it!
All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?|Borrow money from me?
Okay, first—first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , you’re looking down, keep looking down…|Why is there jelly on your shoe?
I had a donut.|Hi!
Hey!|Hey!
Yeah! That guy’s all right!|Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
What?|Y’know, all the women.
Hey well, you can’t teach someone to be good with women. Y’know, that’s why I never had any luck with Chandler.|I’m right here!
Hey! No-no-no-no, you can’t take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!|I’m still right here!
What?!|I just don’t want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush—And I will get over it. It’s-it’s not like I love him, it’s just physical! But—I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
I know, Monica told me.|Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
I don’t know Rach.|Oh, come on! I’ll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?|I don’t know. You uh, you got something for me?
Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.|Ten. Okay. Now Tag there’s such a thing as to many women.
Really?|Yeah, for you!
Hey! There you are!|There I am!
Are you okay?|Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
What?!|Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
Chandler, what were you thinking?|I don’t know, but don’t worry, don’t worry, because I know how to take a picture now.
Chandler?|
Hi.|Hi.
So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?|Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay—and F.Y.I she must’ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass."
Yeah well, maybe she should’ve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.|Well, I don’t think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that’s just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
You think he’s emotionally unavailable?|I think he can be.
Well, maybe he wouldn’t be she didn’t bring the office home every night!|Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year’s Eve 1997.|I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
We want the last six years back!!|So do we!! So do we!!  I’m sorry you had to see that.
Good morning Rachel.|Hi!  Thanks, hey so uh what’d you do last night?
Went out with Joey.|Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
No. We had a really good talk. I don’t think I’m gonna do that bar scene anymore.|Wow! I did not see that coming.
It’s just not really who I am. Y'know, I’ve always been happier when…Why am I telling you this? You don’t care about this stuff.|Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y’know?
When I’m in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.|Really?
Someone I can spoil, y’know?|Sp-spoil?
Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?|Uh-huh.
Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?|Well, I-I’m startin’ too.
And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?|Yes! Hell yes!
All right then, it’s settled.|Okay.
I’m gettin’ back together with my ex-girlfriend.|I’d love to!
What?|Yeah!
My God!|Oh, I’m sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how’s Whitney?
Well maybe she wouldn’t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!|Oh he knows!  For the most part.
Wh-what’s up?|Well, I went over to Kyle’s last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing…
Oh just say it Kyle!|We’re gonna give it another try.
Y’know, he hums when he pees!|I do know.
It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.|We’re so sorry.
That’s all right, we-we don’t need you. In fact, hey I’m over it already.|Yeah, and y’know what? I don’t give a tiny rat’s ass.
I’m sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y’know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.|Oh. Y’know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
Yeah, were better off without them.|And y’know, even if they break up again, you’d better not let him in your sad men’s club!
Divorced men’s club.|Potato, Potaato.
Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!|Ooh, let’s see it!
Okay.|Oh yeah, that looks good.
Yeah, we really do!|Okay.
Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!|Y’know, we don’t have to imagine.
Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.|Oh my God! This is it!  I really hope it’s you!
First of all um, I love you both so much and you’re both so important to me…|Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!
Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine…|Yes!!! Oh!!
If Phoebe were my maid of honor…|Uh-hmm.
Rachel would be Phoebe’s, I would be Rachel’s, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.|Yeah that’s actually a pretty good idea.
Well that’s the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!|Wh-why is that the best part?
Because then I don’t have to!|Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing , my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people that…
I’m really not deciding!|Fine!
Yeah that’s right.|Huh, good luck!
Die Hard still great!|Yep. Hey, what do you say we make it a double feature?
What’d you rent?|Die Hard 2.
Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.|Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!
Yeah, I just got uh, got plans.|Well, John McLane had plans!
No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch.|What are you talking about? Bitch.
Hey Rachel?|Yeah?
Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?|Really?!
Uh-hmm.|Oh my God Phoebe! I mean I’m just—Wait a minute. If I’m your maid of honor that means you are Monica’s.
Oh! Well, if that’s what you want…|Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monica’s!
But why does it even matter?!|Why does it matter so much to you?!
Because this one is now! And-and it’s two of our best friends! Who knows what you’re gonna marry!|What-what if I marry Ross—Or Joey?
You wouldn’t! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-I’ve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know you’ve done it at least twice!|Yeah but Phoebe…
And no, oh please, oh please let me finish.  Oh I guess that was it.|Okay. Okay. It’s—since you’ve never done it before you can be Monica’s made of honor.
Oh, thank you so much!  Okay.|I’m gonna marry someone good y’know.
Oh I know.|Better than Chandler.
What happened?!!|Well, I don’t know!!
We fell asleep! That is all.|Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, I’d better go.
I think that would be best.|Yeah. All right, I’ll talk to you later.
Okay. But not about this!|No! Never! Never!  Bye.
Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then she…she wished me good luck.|That’s sweet.
No, it’s more like a  good luck.|So uh, what did this woman look like?
She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.|Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?
Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?|No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractive…  Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.
What are you doing?|Well, let’s see…
Oh my God yes! Who is she?|Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.
Did you break up with her?|No, we’re still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.
Why?|Well, ‘cause she came back the third summer and she’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow…
Fat?!|I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-ow…"
You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!|Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?
Well, apparently she does.|Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget.  Seriously, good luck marrying me.
Hey! What’s going on?|Phoebe is gonna be Monica’s maid of honor!
Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember?|You have been maid of honor before?!!
Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you’d handle maid of honor type situations.|What are you talking about?
Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if I’m the best of the people they see, they give me the part.|Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?
Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.|Well, it’s better than us deciding.
Hi.|Just uh, brought back your videos.
Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.|No! No we don’t!
Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!|I… I don’t know what you are talking about.
Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!|I’ve had better.
Okay! When?!|All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!
Uh-huh!|I’ve said it! Okay?! But it’s over Joey!
I want to do it again.|We can’t do it again.
Why not?|Because it’s weird!
Fine! Do you want something to drink?|Sure, what do you got?
Chandler!  Chandler! I just figured out who you are!|Can you figure out what I’m doing?
You’re Lewis Posin.|Who?
Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?|Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
No! But because he thought I was to faaaaa….  And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Y’know, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.|What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
No, I know. But y’know what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.|Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!
Okay, all right, this is how it’s going to work. We’re gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.|No, 10 is the highest.
Why is 10 the highest?|Because it’s the highest.
I don’t want to marry Chandler!|Okay, uh…
I’ve got cold feet.|…it’s gonna be okay!
No, one man for the rest of my life? I don’t know if I can do it! This means I’ll never get to sleep with Joey!|Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y’know, it’s-it’s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don’t get to keep the gifts.
Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!|Thanks!
Okay, Phoebe…|Yes! Your honor?
We’re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!|—Ooh!! Ow! Very good!
Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!|Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!
Wow.  Good speech.|Yeah, it really was!
Yeah.|Okay, I can’t believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked.
Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.|Hello Skidmark.
It’s a nickname, I’ll explain later.|It’s pretty clear.
Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.|That’s why you broke up with me?
All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for Rachel—Damnit!|Really?! I won!
Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.|Yeah?
Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.|Why-why would I care about that?
As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.|Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.
I would really love it if could do both.|All right, I…I have to ask.
What?|Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?
What?!|Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?
A hundred and forty-five pounds.|In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That’s not the point.
Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!|Well… That’s not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.
Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.|How?
You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!|What if I have babies, okay? I mean I’m gonna look different. I’m okay with that, but I’m not sure that you are!
Look you have to realize I don’t think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.  See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you’re Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.|Keep going.
So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.|Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?
I’d carry you around in my pocket.|I love you.
Hi Pheebs.|Hi!
Hi! I just want to apologize. I’m really sorry I was a baby.|That’s ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once.  Oh, you mean today.
Yeah. Yeah, and y’know you-you deserve to win. And-and y’know I was thinking about it, if-if you’re Monica’s maid of honor that means I get to be yours.|Oh yeah!
Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, y’know just in case…|Oh that’s so sweet thanks.
Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride.  Y’know I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.|Ohh.
And umm, vintage handkerchiefs y’know ‘cause, people cry at weddings.  I’m just gonna grab a couple of these.|This stuff is great!
Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monica’s something borrowed and it’s blue.  Yeah…|Y’know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica’s made of honor.
You do? Why?|Because I think it means more to you.
But Pheebs, y’know you earned it.|Its fine. I mean, this is something that you’ve been thinking about since you were what, 14?
No, I was ten. I just developed early.|Man alive!
Hey!|Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.
Great nap.|It really was.
|
Morning!|Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
Pretty good.|Oh good.
Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I’m late for work.|What-what?! You’re gonna leave this person with me?!
Yeah—Hey, don’t worry, she’s a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I’m not looking for a serious relationship; that’d be great.|Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
Just casually slip it in, y’know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I’m a loner—No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn’t want to get mixed up with the likes of me.|Y’know what? That’s a lot to remember, can’t I just tell her you’re a pig?
Hey, I’m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He’d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he’d make extras and leave ‘em for me.|Well forget it, I’m not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
Fine!|Hi!
…Come on! Why are we here?!|Okay, okay take a guess.
The hot chicks?|Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y’know-y’know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It’s here! Yeah, it’s right-it’s right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
Wow that’s actually pretty cool.|What is that?
Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.|I’m so sorry!
She sent the chicken back again?!|She says it’s to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!|OH…MY…GAWD!!!!
Janice.|How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
I’m fine.|Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I’m blind!
Oh… Uh…|So, who’s the lucky guy?
OH…MY…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn’t tell her we were getting married, did you?|Well, she saw the ring.
Did she freak out?|Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
Right.|Well, she actually has a boyfriend y’know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
You said no right?|Huh?
You said no right?!|Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can’t wait to read your book Ross!!|Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won’t be so bad.
What do you think she’s just gonna sit there quietly? You don’t think she’s gonna want to make a toast? You don’t think she’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!|Oh my God, she’s not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
Y’know what? It’s gonna be okay. Y’know what? She’s probably not gonna even want to come.|Really?
No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?|So-so you would’ve just lied?
Yes!!|Would it really have been that easy?
Yes!!!|Good, so do it Saturday night because we’re going to dinner with her and Clark.
Hey! What’s up?|Hey!
Hey-hey, who’s your friend?  Hey!!|Hey Joey!
Erin! Still here!|Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!
Why wouldn’t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there’s you guys.|Ohh, listen. I’ve got to get going. Today was great, thanks!
Yeah. I’ll uh, I’ll call ya.|Oh and I’ll call ya too!
Okay, good to see you again.|Bye.
Bye-bye.|Bye!
So, system kinda broke down huh?!|Oh Joey, I’m sorry I just couldn’t tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And y’know we got to talking and I…
What?!!|She is so amazing! You have no idea.
No idea? Who do you think brought her here?|Cupid.
Man, do you know what guys want!|Look Joey, come on she’s so perfect for you! I mean she’s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
My beers?! Look you guys, she’s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just—I don’t see it going anywhere.|Yeah, but you always say that.
Look I’m sorry you guys, I-I just don’t think so.|Whatever.
Hey, don’t start judging me!  Huh? And you, you’re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!|Phoebe!
People are doing it in front of my book!|I’m sorry?
My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin’ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!|Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.|Yeah, there was. It was—there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read—Yes, there was.
Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it’s like uh-a thing!|Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
Oh for cryin’ out loud!|All right, so we should go catch our movie.
Excuse me. Hi, I’m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?|Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!|How can I help you?
Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.|We are aware of the problem you are referring too.  But as far as increasing security, I’m afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can’t help you.
Hey.|Hey!
Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!|Yay!! Oh so, you’re not, you’re not mad at us anymore?
No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y’know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.|Didn’t you sleep together?
Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that’s a…|Oh, please don’t get married before I do.
Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!|He might still show up.
Oh, what are you, stupid? It’s been three hours.|Is that all?
I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don’t you tell about your lovely wedding?|Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We’re not even sure why we’re having it.
How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!|What about Benitez?
What about Game 1 of the Series?|What about shut up?
You shut up!  I’ll be right back.|Okay.
Hey! You wanna go?|Yeah, let’s go.
Okay. See you guys later.|Bye guys.
|Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?|Yeah, we were…we were just looking around.
Oh-oh, you’re-you’re fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps,  perhaps Dr. Chester Stock’s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?|Uhh….
Ah… Ah…Get out of here!  Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion’s views on evolution?|Uh, actually I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.
I find Marion’s views far to progressionist.|I’m sorry, who are you?
I’m a professor here uh, Ross…Geller.|Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It’s uh—Wait!  Did you write this?
Yes! You’re the person who checked out my book?!|Y’know, you look nothing like I would’ve thought. You’re…you’re so young.
Hey!|Hey!
Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still… And guess what, I’m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.|Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
No-no-no-no-no! It’s a surprise, but it’s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.|Oh no, yeah.
Where are you gettin’ this?|Well, she told me. She said she’s kinda a loner.
Oh. Oh.|Joey…
No hey Rach, it’s cool okay? Y’know I’m a loner too!  Right?|Hey Joey, y’know what? You are way to good for her.
No! No. Don’t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.|Well that too.  Joey?
Yeah?|Do you want some pancakes?
What are we gonna do?|I say we go with Careless Whisper.
Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?|Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn’t really be alone tonight.  I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren’t they?|Please, it’s because otherwise I really don’t know what I might do.
Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.|Okay!
We’ll just…we’ll just let her stay.|No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
Kinda like your Barca lounger.|Is that what you’re thinking about right now?
I never stop thinking about it.|Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!|Why?
Because Chandler still has feelings for you!|He does?
That’s right. That’s right. And that is why you can’t stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn’t come to the wedding.|Feelings, such strong feelings.
I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.|Oh…my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I’ll go.
—Okay, see you later.|I just wanted to show Monica your book.
Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!|No, no, no. No-no-no.
What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?|No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.
What? That's like insanely easy!|Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .
What? You forgot fourteen states?|Nobody cares about the Dakotas.
Oh, okay, time's up!|All right, I got 48.
Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?|Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.
Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead in…vegetables, Joey?|Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.
Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!|Does South Oregon have a sports-team?  There you go.
How come we have one extra place setting?|'Cause you invited your assistant.
Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.|Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.
Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.|Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake,  but I still do.
Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.|Phoebe, why is your bag moving?
Oh, it's not!|Seriously, it's moving!
Ross’s apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?|I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
That's my pie!|Which smells delicious!
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!|What?
Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?|Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?
I'm sorry, who's this?|Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!
No, there's no dog here?|Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monica’s apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.
Oh my god! Where are you?|I'll be right there!
They're here already? How are they doing this?|Hi Tag! What are you doing here?
Huh! Where is the dog?!|What dog? There-there's no dog here.
Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!|No that's just me coughing!  Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.
What is it doing here?|Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait.  Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?
Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!|That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days
Really?|Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?
Well, it still has to go, right?|Why?
Okay, it's um…|Don't do it!
Okay, I hate dogs.|What?
They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.|Right, they are scary.  Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!
Is there a puppy here?|You don't like puppies?
Okay, you are new!|Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin’ ice cream.
Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.|It hurts my teeth.
How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.|1250.
Damn, I forgot you were here.|All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross’s. We'll be back in a minute.
Hey!|Hey.
How are you holding up?|Not bad.
Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.|Thanks.
So were you guys together a long time?|A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.
Now that she broke up with you?|Yeah.
Yeah. Hmmmm.|It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?
No…Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it…it has to work out.|Why?
Because, uh—it has to.|You have all the answers, don't you?
Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.|Hey, thanks for talking to me.
Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!|All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!
What did Joey say? I like you back?|Uh, yeah, well, see, he… Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and…you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!
Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.|No?  All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.
Wow.|Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.
|What?
Right there! That's my car!  Hey!!|Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?
I can't believe this!|
Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.|Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.
Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.|Yeah, okay.
Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica!  Oooh, I can't leave her!|You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.
That's not gonna work.|I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.
Hey! I didn't know either.|Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?
Where's Chandler?|Here I am.
Wash your hands!!!|How did you…know?
Hey! What's she doing back here?|Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!
Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...|No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.
Yeah, but, but look what I'm...|See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.
Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.|Why not?
Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.|Well, I, I should go in there.
No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.|Why not?
Because you sent away the dog!|This is ridiculous.
Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend…Phyllis…take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.|What's the matter?
From you?  Yes, please!|First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!
Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.|Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth?  Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out
Hey, is Chandler here?|No, no he went for a walk.
Hi!|Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!
Hi, honey.|Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.
What? Why, why would...|Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.
That's right, she came back all by herself.|It's a Thanksgiving miracle!
Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.|It's up to you.
Oh, hi! How are you doing?|I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
Oh.|Thanks for having me over, you guys.
Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.|Okay.
Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?|Um, I'm not.
Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.|No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.
Really?|Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.
Delaware!  Delaware!|All right.
I want my turkey now!|You got it.  You got Nevada twice.
I know.|Yeah.
I’m ready!|You sure?
Uh-huh!|Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
Thanks daddy.|No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it’s all yours.
Hey! What are you guys doing?|Hey.
I’m sorry, who?|I’m gonna hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
But we don’t know the neighbors.|I do. There’s uh, let’s see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I’ve Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
Wouldn’t it be easier if we just moved?|Gooood morning!!
Eh, somebody’s in a good mood!|Well, why shouldn’t I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?|Yes, at 4:00.
Okay, thank you. That’ll be all.|I’d better get back to my desk.
Okay, you hard worker! I’ll remember to put that in your evaluation.|My what?
Well, you’ve been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y’know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.|Are you serious?
The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!|Well, either that or uh…
Joey!!|Yeah?
Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!|Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
They love my candy? Oh man!!! I’ve gotta go make more!!|Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might’ve happened to a huge chunk of it.
Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!|Mine stole my newspaper! It’s like a crime wave!!  Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
Who is that?!|Don’t worry, I’m brave! I am brave! I…I am brave!  Can you tell me who is there please?
Hi. Do you know what time it is?|It’s candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
Oh please!  Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.|4:00 A.M.
Umm, listen I am sorry, but I’ll put some out first thing in the morning.|Well okay, I’ll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
Um-hmm.|Mm! Seems like I would’ve remembered you!
So did you read your evaluation yet?|No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
Okay please, you’re kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!|A joke they would appreciate?
I’m thinkin’ no.|What did you say?!
Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.|No, not my touchie.
Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.|Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
Oh yeah! I saw her walkin’ it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.|Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin’ it by the park.
Hey Pheebs?|Oh hi!
See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs.  Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!|What happened? I’m just eating candy.
I’m sorry, I can’t help you. See?  Rules are rules.|Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell ‘em?|I told ‘em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
Some people have been saying its y’know little drops of heaven, but whatever.|Please, can’t you help me out?
All right, I’ll do it just this once! But you can’t tell anybody!|Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
It’s unbelievable! I-I can’t believe that sign didn’t work!|Y’know what would work?
Hmm?|Stop making candy!
But they like it!|You mean they like you.
Maybe.|Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you’ll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready…Set…|Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat—or a beanbag chair!
Phoebe, you can’t get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!|Why? Why do I have to learn?
Well…In-in case of emergency.|What kind of an emergency?
Well let there—what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I’ll sh…I’ll shoot you."|Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and—Hey! I’ll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?|You won’t let go?
No!|Swear?!
I swear!|Okay.
Come on.|All right.
All right. Feel good?|Well…
All right, try pedaling.|Okay.
That’s it, your doing great.|Okay.
Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!|Weee!!!
Yes!! Yes!!!|Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
I-I just thought you were doing so well. I…|I am shocked! Shocked!!
Hey, there’s uh, some people outside, askin’ about candy.|Well, they’re just gonna have to wait aren’t they? I’ve only got two hands!!
Need some help?|No! You don’t know the system! There’ll be nobody messing with the system!
Oh, hello liar.|Look, I-I’m really sorry I let go of the bike.
I could’ve been killed I hope you know!|I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
Well, I would love to but…the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.|Phoebe.
What?!  What the hell?!|All right, y’know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I’m sorry, I’m just gonna have to take it back.
What?! Why?!|Because! Because, it-it-it’s… It’d be like you having this guitar  The bike is dying.
All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.|Great! Great!  You’re making the bike very happy.
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we’re gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner’s office. Now, he doesn’t get in until 10, so he’s no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.|That’s kinda sad.
Yeah, well Betty’s kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates.  Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.|Got it!
Let’s roll!|Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
|Uh actually, I’d like to speak with both of you.
Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?|Umm, no. Thanks, but I’ll give these to Betty.  So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
what would happen exactly.|Well, I’d be forced to file a report. I’d have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
Well…|Uh Mr. Zelner, I’m the one who filled in that evaluation.
Oh no-no-no…|Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
You’re lookin’ at it upside down—y’know what?  It doesn’t matter.|Yeah, it’s not like I don’t have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there’s a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now?
Whoa! I can’t believe you did that. That was really sweet.|No, don’t worry about it.
No, you could’ve lost your job.|Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I’d find work.
Thank you! You’re great!|Y’know what?
What?|I feel great.  What?
I… It just—it took me so long to get that desk organized.|Oh, I’m sorry.
What is going on?|We’re waiting for the candy.  Bring out the candy!
Joey!|What’s up buddy?
What are you doing?|Waiting for candy.
Get in here!  Merry Christmas.|Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down!  What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I’ll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?|Candy Lady?
No not  Candy Lady.|Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
All right, y’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You’ve ruined it! Go home! You’ve ruined it! You’ve ruined it!|That’s right, it’s all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
You’re welcome.|Did you smoke?
No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh—are you okay?|I’m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
I can’t believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I’d be able to do that! Thank you Ross.|Oh hey, don’t thank me, thank yourself. You’re the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
Buh-bye.  I just got us reservations at Michelle’s and tickets to the Musicman to celebrate our first holiday season as a betroughed couple.|Betrothed…
…betrothed couple.|Hey!
Hey!|Hi!
Pheebs?|Huh?
Skull?|Oh, yeah, it's my mom's.
How long have we been home?|About a half an hour.
Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?|No.
Why not?|Bing's weird.
Hey!|Hey!
Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?|Yeah, why not?
Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him.|Why do you think, she's having so much fun living with Joey?
No reason, except…she…told…me.|Really? So she said, she didn’t wanna live with me anymore?
No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.|Phoebe, don't worry about it. I'm sure she wants to live with you.
Hey!|Hey! Great, you’re home! Guess what Phoebe got me for Christmas!
Drums?|No! Drums!
|I'm sorry. But not that sorry, 'cause you don't have to live with it. Um, we have a reservation under the name Chandler Bing.
Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.|I'm sorry. Christmas is a very busy time, sir.
Is this because of the burrito thing?|You need to give him money.
Give him money? It was a joke!|No, to get a table! Places like are always shakin’ you down. Everybody wants to be paid off.
Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money.|You've got to be smooth about it.
Hey, I can be smooth.|Of course, sir.
Okay.|How did it go?
Wooooooo, hehehe. Hey, ahh, you don't feel like you're gonna throw up, do ya?|No.
Well, I do, so let's...  So, Ben, you uh, you know what holiday is coming up, don't ya?|Christmas.
Yep, and you know what other holiday is coming up?|Christmas eve.
Yes, but also  Hanukkah! See, you're part Jewish, and-and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.|Santa has reindeers that can fly!
Right, um, but, on Hanukkah, Hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle. See, years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees.|Jingle bells, jingle bells...
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made you out of clay.|Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer...
Okay, it's not a contest.|When is Santa coming?
Well, how about this year, instead of Santa, we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?|No Santa? Was I bad?
No! Oh, no-no-no. Hey, you weren't bad, you've been very good, Ben.|Santa's mad at me.
No, hey-hey, come on,  Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay? Hey, you're-you're his favorite little guy!|So Santa's coming?
It's easy! Just keep it casual! Give him a kind word, shake his hand and give him the money!|How do you know so much about this?
I don't know.|Richard used to do it, didn't he?
We'd be eating our soup right now.|Mustached bastard…
Okay, those people just left, come on! Quick! Give him the money and get their table!|Excuse me...
|
Ha!|So you like the drums! That's, that's great! Y’know, I was worried, that, you know, they would maybe an unbearable living situation. All right, okay, well, apparently not! So, yay!
Tequila!!|That's fun.
Here you go.|Thank you Gunther, put it there.  Thank you.
Joey, y’know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.|What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?
What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?|Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!
Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.|
What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?|Our apartment is ready.
And that makes you angry because…|Because you would rather live here with Joey.
Where did you get that?|Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.
Phoebe?|Hm?
Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!|Fish!
It wouldn't have mattered anyway, Phoebe, you and I are, are gonna live together, we're roommates; that's the deal.|Yes, but I wanted you to want to live with me, but okay, if you're having so much fun over here…
Oh, it's so much more fun with you.|We did have fun, didn't we?
We did!|Oh, anyway, they say, if we want, we can see it tonight.
Oh, I would love to!|Yay, okay!
Good, good, good, good, good.|Great, all right, okay, and Monica ask me to make the drumming stop.
Hey!|Hello, Sir. You're here to return those pants?
No, these are my pants.|Oh. Okay! How can I help you?
Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?|Two days before Christmas? Sorry, man.
I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a Merry Christmas!|What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?
Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.|Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from…Texas.
Wow! Thanks!|You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!
Are you for Hanukkah, too? Because I'm part-Jewish.|You are? Me, too!
Cool!|Yeah!
Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...|Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
What are you doing here, Santa?|Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird…turtle-man?
I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?|What?
What are you doing?|You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.|Why?
Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you’re wrecking it.|But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.|Fine, I'll give the suit back.
|Santa? Really?
Yes, is that okay?|Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
No.|Then it's okay!
Oh wow! Look at this place!|Oh, this is terrible. Oh, they’ve made so many changes I can’t even feel my grandmother’s presence anymore—Ooh! New sconces!
Oh my God!|What?
Okay, remember uh, remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms?|Yeah?
And remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down?|Yeah?
Do you really not know where I’m going with this?  It left! It’s one huge room!|Oh no!  Oh! Wow!!!
See?|Well, I guess we’ll just have to put the wall back up.
You can’t, because of the new skylight!|There’s a skylight?!  Wow!!
So what should we do? Should we start looking for a new place?|Y’know I’m-I’m sensing that um, my grandmother would not be comfortable with that.
Oh yeah? Startin’ to feel her again there are we?|A little bit, yeah.
Pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?|You heard her too?! You have the gift!
Phoebe, it’s okay. I like living with Joey.|Are you sure?
Oh please, I hate packing, it’s closer to work, and we do have fun. Although, I’m really gonna miss living with you.|Oh me too.
I know.  Oh-oh, wait did you hear that-hear that? Listen, I’m gettin’ something from your grandmother, she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give Rachel the purple chair?|No, I do not hear that.
…and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should’ve just lasted just one day, burned for…|Eight whole days.
That’s right, and that’s why we celebrate Hanukkah today. The end.|Awesome!
Yeah?|My favorite part was when Superman flew all the Jews out of Egypt.
The Armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part! Okay Ben, it’s time to light the Hanukkah candles!|Hey!
Come on, come on, we’re-we’re-we’re lighting the candles!|Oh.
I got it!|Is it back in the cage?
Its back in cage!|Cage closed?
Ohh. Mmm.|Hi.
Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.|Oh, y’know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I—
It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.|Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.  Thief.
I—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.|Why, why not?
Because it's too delicious.|Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate,  I feel terrible, I’m a horrible, horrible, horrible person.|Oh, I’m sorry what?
All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y’know I’m in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I’m not brain dead.|So…
Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it’s just not my character that’s not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?|Absolutely!
I’ll see you at 8:00.|Okay.
Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!|Umm, I think he’s still out. What’s wrong?
Well, I’ll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.|Big Daddy?
Oh that’s a nickname we were trying out.|Hey, y’know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
Oh! Here’s Joseph Francis!|Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
So what?! That doesn’t give you the right to ditch me!|Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
I don’t accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can’t just be a way to kill time ‘til you meet someone better! Y’know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this  is for life!|Wow! I’m so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
Well, it does.|Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I’m sorry.  How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I’ll pay for myself!
Okay, you wore me down.|Hey Joe, while you’re over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
Hi!|Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
So just bring it back downstairs, what’s the problem?|I can’t seem to say goodbye.
Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?|Well I’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling…  Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!|Y’know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
Yeah and we’ll drop it off downstairs so that we’re not tempted.|Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
Awww! Mel Torme died.|Joey, that paper’s like a year old!
Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody’s sale is over?!|Hey.
Hey.|Hey.
Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross’s behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y’know, since she has a chance to get on broad back…|Not broad backed!
Aww that’s nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.|We’ll see.
Well, thank you for lunch.|What? Wait a minute, I didn’t pay, I thought you paid!
So apparently we just don’t pay for food anymore.  Do you see what I see?|
Mrs. Braverman must be out.|She could be out of town. Maybe she’ll be gone for months.
By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake.|No that could kill her.
Well, we don’t want that.|No so we’re protecting her.
But we should take it.|But we should move quick.
Why?|Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
Oh my God! That’s David!|David who?
David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!|Oh my God!
Oh, you say someone’s name enough, they turn around.|Phoebe?
David!  What-what are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be in Russia?|Yeah, I’m just, I’m just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
Well… Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?|Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
Yeah.|Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make…
Uh-huh.|Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn’t know whether I should call or not, y’know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y’know, I didn’t want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and—but I didn’t know if you wanted to see me.
Well, of course I would want to see you. I…I think about you all the time.|Really? Because I think about you all the time.
Really?|I mean, there’s a statue in Minsk…
Uh-huh.|That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it’s actually of Lenin. But, y’know at certain angles…
Yeah.|Umm, anyway…Do you want to have dinner tonight?
Yes! Oh no!|Oh. Uh, what?
I can’t. I can’t believe I have plans, I can’t. Can you do it tomorrow night though?|Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y’know, next time you’re in Minsk umm…
Uh-huh.|What are you doing?
Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.|So! He’ll understand!
No he won’t. And that’s not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y’know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don’t have my principles, I don’t have anything!|God, you are so strong.
Oh my God! That is so good!|I’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I’ll regret it.
Hey!|What do you got there?
Oh it’s umm, it’s tofu cake. Do you want some?|What are you doing tonight?
Oh here, I think this is us.  Yeah.|Limited seating my ass. Let’s see who made the cut.  Hi!
Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.|So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
Hey!|Hey!
Are you guys ready?|Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water’s fine.
Okay.|Okay.
And for you sir?|Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin’ here?
It’s uh, it’s already been roasted.|Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
Actually we’re out of the lobster ravioli.|Oh well, that changes everything!  Y’know what Pheebs?
Any progress?|Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
Hey!|Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn’t think you were coming.
Oh, I wouldn’t miss this.|Well, I’m very glad you’re here.
Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!|
I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now.  How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!|Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
Y’know what? I don’t trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I’m takin’ it back!|What?! What?!
Oh yes!|Wait a minute!
Oh yes! Oh yes!|You think I trust you with it?! No! We’re gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
Well that’s not fair, you’ve already had some!|What? Oh, well then y’know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
What do we use to split it?|Okay!  All right, pick a half.
Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh… There’s more crust on this side. Y’know? So, maybe if I measured…|Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
All right, I’ll pick that one.|That’s also the smaller piece.  Oh!!!!
Ohhh!|Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
Ross, sweetheart!|Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can’t miss my flight.|Are you sure? I’ll bet there’s another flight to Minsk in like…
July. Umm,|That’s really beautiful. What does it mean?
Please, clean my beakers. I don’t get out of the lab much.|That’s good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
Yeah, I… Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn’t because y’know, I…have to leave.|You’re right! You’re right. Don’t say it.
I-I do though.|I do too.
Bye Phoebe.|Okay, now’s not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!|Stick to your side!
Hey, come on now!|
Oh wait I forgot my wrap.|What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
Ross, when’s this comet thing start?|Well, technically it seven billion years ago…
Okay, we’ve been out here for two hours and we haven’t seen any stupid comets. Can we go now? I mean, Chandler’s getting chilly.|No, I’m not!
Monica!|She’s sleeping.
I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?|Deep Impact was the one with Robert Duval, Armageddon is what’s going to happen to you if you wake me up.
Sorry, I just…can’t sleep. Ooh!|It is in the living room where there is also a light! And no one will kick you in the shin.
How could you be beeping?! I just disconnected you! I took out your battery! How can…|Beep!
Rachel!! Monica!!|Come on!
I can’t believe this!!|All right well, y’know…I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
Help us! Please help us! We’re stuck up on the roof and we can’t get down!!!|Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
Shhhhhhhhh!!!  I’m sorry, I thought maybe I’d make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.|With a wok?  I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!|Here, let me make the milk, I’m up anyway.
Hey, y’know what we can do? Y’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y’know like we did when we were first going out. It’d be fun!|Okay that does sound like fun.
Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?|The second sister dies?!
No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.|The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
You wanna go in the bedroom? It’s a little more comfortable.|Sure.
Okay.  Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?|If this is your idea of sexy talk?
No seriously, y’know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?|What contracts?
Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don’t get.|Like what?
Y’know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?  Tag! I’m serious! This isn’t funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!|Rach, I’m sorry, but you didn’t give me any contracts!
Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn’t want to seem to bossy.|I’m telling you, you never gave them to me.
Y’know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.|No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!|You wanna go down to the office right now?
No! Come on its late, we’re not gonna go down to the office.|Okay I understand.  I wouldn’t want to be proved wrong either.
All right, it won’t go down any further. It’s stuck.|Ugh. Well, we’re just gonna have to jump.  Yeah. Now, we’re gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there…you go up to the roof and you let me in.
Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!|Yeah! Oh yeah, you’ll be fine! It-it’ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y’know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won’t.
What if I smack my head on the concrete?|Well, I’m gonna lie to you Joey, it’s a possibility.
I don’t know Ross! I-I tell you what, let’s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?|Oh, all right.  Can you-can you see what it is?
No.|Okay. Well, you be careful.
What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I’m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can’t go if I break my leg.|Well I’m jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won’t have a father if-if I die!
Okay, here’s your milk. What do you want to talk about?|What? What? What?
Okay! Feel free to look, but I’m telling you those contracts are not on this desk.|Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I’m talking about! You have to be organized! You’ve got newspapers! You’ve got magazines! You got—Ohh!  And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
It’s my sister.|Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y’know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?|In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it  that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
It’s not here.|Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don’t you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
How could I have left them in the copy room?|I don’t know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It’s not a perfect world! Just go please.
Fine.|Thank you.  I still don’t get it.
Are you still awake?|Yeah! You?
You do know that was me who just said that right?  Hey. As long as we’re both up…|I hope you’re not thinking about cleaning the living room.
Man, I’m starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!|Y’know, y’know I’m lookin’ and I don’t think anyone’s home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y’know explain later.
Yeah? Really? No one’s home?|I don’t think so. Hello?
What?! What are you doing?!|Do you know what just happened?
Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.|No. We were in the middle of sex…and you fell asleep.
Nooo! No, that’s not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!|Monica?
What?!|I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
Okay. Okay, I’m ready. Come on big fella!|Okay.
Give me the good stuff.|Yeah!  And I probably won’t spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh…  …fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?|Still no luck.
Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!|Do you want me to check again?
Well yeah, I wish that you would.|Well, it’s not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
|Any luck?
Can I see you in my office for a minute?|Y’know what? I’m not even going to gloat. I’m just really relived this whole thing is over.
You put these on my desk!|I did not!
Oh really? So you’re saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!|How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
Oh my God! How did you get back here?!|Phoebe Buffay?!
Oh! Hi, officer—fireman, can-can I help you?|We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
That’s not mine.|Yes it is.
How do you know?|The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don’t wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
Okay do you—Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!|Please reattach this, it’s against the law to disconnect them.
Fine!  But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!|There’s a reset button under the plastic cover.
Okay, do-do you have a good grip?|Yeah!
Okay, I’m going to start climb down you now.|All right! Just hurry up!
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.|I think face to face.
I would say that.|Face to face, yeah!
Okay, here I go.|All right.
I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.|Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.
So what do you want me to do?|Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
Hi.|Hi.
M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.|Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
It’s still looks pretty far!|It’s not that far! Just drop!
Do not rush me!!|Ross, you should know that my pants are startin’ to come down and I’m not wearing any underwear!
That really was some of your best work.|Hm-hmm, I told you!  I can’t believe that I’ve only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
I have to be up in seven minutes.|Well, you’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes…
Really?!|Do you wanna?
Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I’ll get the furniture polish!|Brian Buckner & Sebastian Jones
Hey.|Hey.
What are you doing?|Well, y’know I was thinking of moving the couch over here.
Why would you want to do that?|So that there will be a decent place for me to sit.
Rach, there is a decent place to…|And your lap does not count! Okay? Come on help me move this.
No. No. No.|No?
No. Rosita does not move.|I’m sorry, Rosita? As in…
As in Rosita does not move.|Joey, it’s just a chair! What’s the big deal?
The big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it’s at the perfect angle so you don’t get any glare coming of off Stevie.|Stevie the TV?
Is there a problem?|No!  You bitch!
Hey, y’know what’s weird? After you guys get married, when you introduce me to people you’re gonna have to say, "This is my brother-in-law Ross." Not, "My friend Ross," "brother-in-law Ross." That’s weird isn’t it?|Couldn’t I just say, "This is Ross?"
Sure, do whatever you want.|Hey Ross! So, I was checking out the uh, real estate section…
Yeah?|Look at this.
Oh, it looks like mom and dad’s house. Oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh, the window in the attic is…Oh my God!!|What? What happened to the window in the attic?!
I can’t believe they-they didn’t even tell us!|I can’t believe I still don’t know what happened to the window in the attic!
Who did you leave a message with?|
Joey, Joey I am so sorry.|I told you not to move it! Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said don’t, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?
Okay, come on—Joey, I’ll buy you a new one! All right? We’ll go down to the store right now and we’ll-we’ll get you a new chair.|She’s not even cold yet!
But don’t you think Rosita would’ve wanted you to move on? I mean y’know, she did always put…your comfort first.|That’s true.
Okay? You ready?|Yeah, I…  I don’t want Stevie to see her like this.
I can’t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in. Man, some-some stranger’s gonna be living in my room.|Well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you, it’s time the velvet ropes came down.
They kept your room for a while.|Oh please! Dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after I moved out! I gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of Victoria’s Secret catalogues, not a gym!
Come on, you know they love you.|As much as they love you?
I was their first born! They thought she was barren! It’s not my fault.|Hey.
Hey.|Hey!
What’s wrong with this year?|Well okay, it’s already February and I’ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world!
Hey, y’know if you want to pick up some extra cash? Some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing.|Oh that’s a great idea. You’re really good on the phone.
What?|Oh yeah, like you never called!
So basically this is very easy. You read from the script and try to sell as much toner as you possibly can.|Okay, I can do that! Oh, by the way, I love my office.
Why don’t we do a trial run.|Oh okay. Umm, all right.  Hi, this is Phoebe from Empire Office Supplies, can I speak to your supply manager please?
I’m the supply manager.|Umm, okay I would like to talk to you about your toner needs.
We don’t need any toner.|Oh okay, well I’m sorry to bother you. Bye-bye.  Yeah you’re right, this is easy.
Okay, what was wrong with that call?|Oh well, all right…um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.
They’re always going to tell you they don’t need toner, but that’s okay because whatever they say, you can find the answer to it here in this script.|Oh.
So, I think you’re ready to sell toner, do you have any last questions?|No.  Oh wait yes! I do, I do have one question. What is toner?
Dad?|I’m here!
Hey!|Hi. God, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.
Dad, we-we can’t believe you’re selling the house.|Well, it’s time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.
Let’s grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.|I’m sorry we can’t store your childhood things anymore.
Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.|Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies!
Wow! Great!  Wait, dad who-who’s cigarettes are these?|I don’t know. They-they must be your mother’s, but please, please don’t ask her. I’ll throw these away.
Cool! Dad! My report cards! Hey, check this out dad,  Oooh, my rock polisher!|Oh look, look there’s your old makeup kit!
It’s a clown kit! Clown kit!|Well, the white seems to be untouched.  Uh-oh.
What?|Y’know how the garage floods every Spring?
How are you ever going to sell this place?|I think I accidentally used Monica’s boxes to keep the water away from the Porsche.
Oh no. Dad! Dad! What… Oh God…everything’s ruined! Dad, she’s gonna be crushed!|You don’t secretly smoke do you?
No!|So it’s just your mother then.
I don’t need any toner.|I’m hearing what you’re saying, but at our prices everyone needs toner.
Not me.|May I ask why?
You wanna know why. You wanna know why?|I surely do!
Okay, I don’t need any toner because I’m going to kill myself.|Umm, is-is that because you’re out of toner?
Okay, so…no toner today. Thanks anyway, bye-bye.|No-no wait-wait! I can’t just let you hang up! Just please talk to me.
Well…I only have one thing to do today.  I guess I could push it back.|Yeah! Now, why do you want to kill yourself?
It’s just that I uh, have been working for ten years now at this meaningless, dead-end job and nobody here even knows I exist!|Chandler?
I-I’m sorry?|No look, I-I’m sure that people know you exist!
My chair. Now, if anybody asks, your name is Rosita!|You will like it!
Well, she’ll understand right? It’s not like I did it on purpose.|Dad that won’t matter to her. Look, all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is-is, is growing new stuff! See, this is exactly the kind of thing that makes her think you guys love me more than you love her.
Oh my God, does she really thinks that?|Well, can you blame her?
Well I don’t know, I-I suppose we may have favored you unconsciously, you were a medical marvel! The doctor said your mother could…|Dad, dad I don’t want to hear about it.
Really?|Well, not right now. Okay look, Monica came here for some memories and damnit, we’re gonna give her some! Okay, grab…grab some empty boxes. Okay? We’ll-we’ll take stuff from mine and whatever we can pass off as hers we’ll-we’ll put ‘em in their.
Great!|Like uh y’know like this! This!  She-she could’ve made this!
Sure!|Right? And this!  She-she could’ve won this!
This could’ve been hers!|Sure! Ooh-ooh, what about this?
I am so psyched I kept this chair for myself!|Yeah, me too.
Hey, how’s…how’s the uh, miracle chair?|Fine.
Yeah? Wow! Y’know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest!|No. Really?
Yeah! You can hook it up to your TV and you get radio!|My chair heels itself.
Earl, you’re not hearing me! All I’m saying is that you’re not alone all right? Everybody hates the people they work with!|Hey guy!
Wait, what was that? That sounded like someone being nice to you.|No! That’s just the "Hey Guy" guy. He says that to everybody! He’s the worst! I’d like to take him with me!
All right so Earl, let’s just forget about the people at the office, okay? There-there’s gotta be someone else in your life worth sticking around for! What about-what about your family, your friends, or maybe your girlfriend?|Yeah! Right!
Oh sorry, boyfriend!|Oh no.
No, whatever! Anything!|Hey guy!
Yeah, he’s gotta go.|Okay, I should, I should probably be getting back to my thing now. See ya.
No! I’m not finished yet! Don’t! Don’t you dare hang up on me!!!|The new girl’s good.
Hey guys! Hey!|Hey.
Hey, I just whipped us up some Easy Bake treats, they should be ready in about three days.|That’s a good one! Do you hear that Ross? Three days!
Okay. So, which boxes are mine?|Well, these. These are yours right here.
Okay.|Yeah. Yeah, oh you loved that thing. You always had it with you. You never went anywhere without-without that coloring book.
Really? Wow! It looks like I had some trouble staying inside the lines.|Nu-uh!
Oh, an old glove?|Oh, yeah you loved that glove! You took it every place you went. You never went any place without that glove.
Wow! Look at this!|Oh, I don’t know how that got in there.
These are your boxes! Where are my boxes?|Umm, your boxes are umm…
What?|Dad?
Just mine?|I’m afraid so.
So why-why wasn’t Ross’s stuff ruined?  And if you say the words medical marvel I’m going to Easy Bake your head!|Well, I used your boxes to divert water away from the Porsche.
So wait, Ross’s stuff is fine, but I have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water!!!|There was also leaves and guk and stuff.
I can’t believe this!|
Hey Chandler!|Hey!
How would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines, has a rolling massage, and speakers in the head rest?|Yeah, I’d love to but I’ve tried that so many times they won’t even let me in the store anymore.
Well what if I told you, you can do it in my apartment?|Are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete? The chair that Sit magazine called the Chair of the Year?
I just purchased the La-Z-Boy E-cliner 3000.|That’s awesome! That’s great! What made you do it?!
Well, it’s a long story, but umm I broke Joey’s chair…|Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke Joey’s chair?
Yeah.|I thought I broke Joey’s chair! That’s why I replaced it with mine!
Ohhhhh. That’s how it got fixed!|Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?
Noo!  Angels.|I’m gettin’ my chair back!
What? Wh-hey!|Well, it looks like it wasn’t heeled after all! Yeah! So, I guess this chair is mine now!
Yeah, he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs!|So, there was no miracle?!
No Joe, no miracle.|Oh no this is devastating! My faith is shaken. I’m so glad I have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life.
Uh-huh! Nice try, but you don’t get that chair anymore! All right? That is my chair now! You can sit on my lap!  No I take that back!|I think I should get the chair!
No-no-no! This chair’s not going anywhere.|Well, where’s the logic in that?!
The logic is, that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half!|So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
Excuse me! Can you tell me where I can find Earl? He’s the supply manager around here.|Sorry, I don’t know any Earl.
Earl! I’m Phoebe.|Phoebe? The lady who sells toner?
Umm, look it, you-you can’t kill yourself.|Look, um I really appreciate your coming down…
No-no I can’t! I can’t let you do it!|Why?!
Because it was fate that made me call you today!|I thought it was toner.
No! Think about it okay? This isn’t even my regular job! Okay? And my first day on the job, you’re my first call! And-and somebody else might’ve hung up on you, but I wouldn’t do that because I know about this stuff. My mom killed herself.|Really?!
Yes.|How?
I’m not gonna give you tips! Look don’t you see that this-this…this all came together so that I could stop you from doing this.|Couldn’t it just be a coincidence?
No, it’s fate!|It doesn’t really seem like enough to be fate.
Oh. Well umm, okay here’s a weird thing. My mother was also a supply manager.|I’m actually the office manager.
Oh my God! So was she! And! Get this, okay? Your-your name is Earl, right? Her name was Pearl, P-Earl.|Well, was there anything else?!
Sure!  Umm, where are you from?|Philadelphia.
Oh my God! So was she! Oh, I’ve got-I’ve got goose bumps.|Really?
Well, y’know I’m wearing layers and it’s warm.|Yeah-yeah.
But if—no look, okay. These jerks might not care about you, but the universe does! And that says a lot!|I really wished they’d care just a little bit though.
Y’know, I don’t-I don’t think it’s you. This is a freaky place.  Oh no, it’s you.|Yeah.
Oh, this terrible! Everything is destroyed! Look at this.  What do you think this is?|All right. I think it was a mouse.
How do you think I am?! You’ve wrecked all my childhood memories. You love Ross more than me. And I just rubbed a dead mouse on my face!|Sweetheart, we love you just as much as Ross! Now, I’m sorry about everything that happened and I’d probably never be able to make it up to you, but here’s a start.
What’s this?|It’s the key to my Porsche. Well, the key to your Porsche.
What?!|What?!!!
Wait, you’re giving me your Porsche, you’re kidding me right?!|Well w-w-w-w-wait, w-wait, wait, wait a minute! I mean a couple of stupid boxes get wet and she gets a Porsche?!
All right!|Well, what about me?! I’m a medical marvel!!
Oh yeah.|Ahhhh….
Ahhh……  Eh?|Uh-huh.
Hey!|Do you guys know what happened to Chandler’s barca lounger?
Happy birthday!!!|Happy birthday!!!
We’ve got presents!|Good ones?
Y’know, I’m still 29 in Guam.|Hey, 30 is not that old! Do you know how old the Earth is?
Late thirties? Oh come on you guys! Is it just me? Am I overreacting to this?|No Rach, it’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn’t that much fun.
Rach, you’re in a great place in your life. Come on, you’ve got a great job! Good friends…|Yeah, you’re roommate is a soap opera star.
Come on Phoebe! You can do it Phoebe! Come on!|There you go!
Thirty. Ugh, I mean thirty! Monica, do you remember mean, old Mrs. Kreeger in the fifth grade? She was thirty!|Come on, let’s have some fun. Huh?  What do you want to do today?
Nothing. I don’t want to do anything.|Well, doing nothing on your thirtieth is better than doing something stupid, like Ross.
How hot do I look in this, huh?!|Ross, a sports car? Wouldn’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?
That’s not what this is about okay? I-I am a sports car enthusiast. I have always been into cars.|Hey, what’s the horsepower on this thing?
I don’t know, but-but look how shiny!|I can’t believe you bought this.
Damnit!|Okay, who’s next?
Y’know what? I am going to do something today. I’m not just gonna sit around like some old lady. I’m gonna get something pierced. Like my uh, like my nose or my tongue or something.|Really?! ‘Cause y’know that hurts.
So what?! Y’know what? The way I see it——Ow! Son of a bitch!!|Look Rachel, I know what you’re going through. I’m totally freaked about turning 25.
Get out, get out of my apartment.|All right Rach, for what it’s worth, I think that you’re doing great. I mean y’know let’s face it, no one handles this well.
Would you put that back on?! Monica’s gonna be here any minute!|But it hurt’s my Joey’s Apple.
Okay, for the last time. It’s not named for each individual man.|You’ve done a wonderful job with this party Chandler. Everything looks so lovely.
Oh well, not as lovely as you. I mean, I can’t believe that you would have a thirty-year-old daughter!|It’s older than that. Ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.
Ohh!|Hey! Everybody hide! Hide! I saw her! She’s coming!
Okay! Okay! Everybody down! Everybody down!|Crap.
Okay, everybody stay here. I will find out what’s going on.|Heyyy!! You got the door open!!
Hey-hey are you drunk?|Nooo!  I wanna puke on you later!
Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!|Noo!!!
Yes!|Noo!!
Yes!!|Oh no! My parents have never seen me drunk!  That they know of.
Okay, here’s the thing. We’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that you’re drunk.|Really?! You promise?
Yeah, I’ll take care of it.|Okay. I love you so much.
Okay we have to do something about your breath.|What about your breath?!
That’s still yours. Okay, now remember it’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised.|Okay. I can do that.
Okay.|Surprise!!!
Okay, forward. Forward—Stop!  Okay, forward—Stop! Stop! Stop!|Ross, just forget about it. This guy’s got you totally wedged in.
No-no-no! It’s mine! It’s-it’s mine.|Dude, you soooo need this car.
Happy thirtieth birthday! Here!  It’s for the child in you, and the woman. Happy thirtieth!|Right, why do you keep saying that?
Because it’s our thirtieth birthday.|Yeah, no we’re not thirty. We’re 31. Okay.
Wait!|Oh, it’s you.
Yeah. What?!|Yeah, we’re not thirty, we’re 31.
Nu-uh!|Yea-huh! That’s what is says on my birth certificate.
You have your birth certificate?|Yeah, I got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.
Our mom.|
Do you have my birth certificate?|No, I sold it to a Swedish runaway.
Oh my God! Oh my God, we are 31.|Yeah.
I just lost a whole year of my life.|Okay.
Your middle name is Pamela?|Yes.
Well, I never knew mine. Do you remember what it is?|Yes! Phoebe.
That’s my first name.|Right, okay, then no.
Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress.|Yay!
See?|Happy birthday, sweetie! Give us a hug!
Phil.|Phil!
Now, there is a dress laid out on your bed.  you’re doing great. You’re doing great. You’re doing fine.|Hey, what’s going on?
Monica’s a little drunk.|Yay! I love drunk Monica!
She doesn’t want her parents to know she’s drunk.|Ohh! All right! All right. Here’s what we’ll do, I’ll get twice as drunk as Monica and then no one’s will even notice her.
Monica’s wasted.|Maybe that will liven up this party.
Okay, will you just go help her change please!|Okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for Joey.
This one’s from me.|Ahh!
It wasn’t on your list, but hopefully you’ll think it’s really fun.|
Hey! Look who’s back! It’s the birthday girl! How’s the birthday girl feeling?|Well, I feel fine, but I think you’re bumming out the rest of the kids.
What?|Okay! Y’know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids…
Which is fine! Because you just turned——twenty-eight!|No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!
I’m telling you it’s like watching Bambi learn how to walk.|You’re drunk! Mom and dad are gonna be maaaaadd! Maybe I’m a little drunk.
I lost a whole year! I can’t believe it! This is so unfair!|Oh, I don’t know Pheebs. It’ll be okay.
Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?|That’s not gonna happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!
Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I…I haven’t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!|Like what?
Like okay I-I-I, I haven’t met any Portuguese people! I, I haven’t had the perfect kiss! And I haven’t been to sniper’s school!|Phoebe, y’know why don’t we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?
No, I just feel like being by myself for a while. All right? I’ll see you guys later. Thanks.|Hey.  Oh, poor Pheebs.
Pheebs! Wait up!  Maybe that’s one thing you can cross off your list.|Oh yeah.
Oh, and plus I’m 1/16th Portuguese.|Oh!
Okay, is everybody clear? We’re gonna pick it up…and move it. Now all we need is teamwork, okay? We’re gonna lift the car…and slide it out. Lift and slide!|Ross, I really don’t think…
Lift!! And slide!|Okay, here we go.
Hey Joey, can I…|Oh, come on Rach! My turn just started!
Actually, I just wanna talk to Tag.|Oh. Okay. Hey, can I ride this outside?
Whatever! Okay, I’m not your mother.|Okay!
Not in the street!!|Yes!
Hi.|Hey.
Hey.|How are you doing? Are you feeling any better?
Yeah, I’m doing okay. I’m um…let’s talk.|Okay.
Umm…|What’s up?
Ohh Tag, umm…you’re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but I don’t-I don’t…|Wait! I think I see where you’re going, but before you say anything else, can I just say one more thing?
Well said. And a uh good example of the fun I was referring to uhh, but I just think I’m past the point where I think I can y’know, just have fun.|Rachel, don’t do this. This is just because you’re turning thirty.
Yeah, it is! But you’re just a kid! I mean you’re 25!|Twenty-four actually.
Oh God! Y’know what I wish? I wish you were six years older. Well actually, if I’m wishin’ for stuff, I actually wish I was six years younger.|Me too.
Hey! How’d it go?|Oh, if I only want two kids, can I keep him for another year?
Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds.|God, do you realize in ten years we’re gonna be 40?
Yes! My baby’s finally free!|All-all right!  Start it up! Let’s go!
Woohoo!|How hot are we?
You wanna buy a car?|No.
I’m glad you’re here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.|Ohh…
Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.|Oh! I would love to read a poem.
Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.|Ohhh…
Do you mind telling us what it is?|Sorry, I’m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
What is DOOL?|Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you’re not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
Who are they killing off?|Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
She’s my favorite character on DOOL.|Nice.
And the way she slaps all the time!|Oh!
Wouldn’t you love to do it just once?!|Don’t do it.
Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?|Well, I'd have to say gay.
Yeah? Why?|Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.|Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
|All right, straight, and not subtle.
Ohh, he left his cell phone.|Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.|What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
Yeah… That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.|What? Wait! Why…why do you get the story?
I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.|Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
That wasn’t a date! That was, that was just friends getting together… having sex.|Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.|Yeah!  And until now, I didn’t think I’d love again.
Nice try.|Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
I don’t know.|Well umm, maybe we could uhh…  Ah-ha! Too slow!!
I’m going to keep dating him Mother, and there’s nothing you can do about it!|Oh yes there is!
What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!|That was an accident! And so were you.
Well, at least I’m not a murderer!|
Can I get some ice here?!|Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that’s not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don’t we, why don’t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.|Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
I don’t think so.|Fine all right, but I’d bet you’d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.|Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.|Did I use that already today? I’m sorry.
Yes okay.  Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat’s a steak house!|Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that’s one for you.
Oh, I win! He’s got Barney’s on his speed dial.|So you don’t know that’s Barney’s the store! That can be y’know his friend’s house, or a bar. Who has Barney’s the store on their speed dial?
What is that?|I think it’s the dying cat parade.
It sounds like it’s coming from across the street.|Oh my God!
What?|Y’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You’re half Scottish right?"
Nooo!!|Yes!!
No, there is no way! It can not be Ross!  Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!|Why is your family Ross?!
He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It’s not even a song!|If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
Hi Pheebs!|Hi!
How are ya?|Good.
Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy’s cell phone?|Yeah.
And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?|Yeah!
And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!|Ooh, now you lost me.
You stole the phone!|No I didn’t!
No? So you’re saying that if I called it, it wouldn’t ring?|No.
Phoebe!|That is a different phone.
Oh is it?!  It’s for me!|That is damning evidence.
Oh my God! I bet that’s him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh  Would you stop doing that?!|Yes, I’m the one who found your phone.
Phoebe! You can’t do th…|
You do know that I will be here when he comes over.|Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
You just said it!|Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just…be alone y’know to think about my mom and her suicide.
Oh Phoebe!|What?! That’s the first time today!
So you like the nachos uh? Myself I’m partial to…|I’m 16.
See you in 2003.|You’re absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don’t know exactly when it’s going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that’s it.
I’m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.|Yeah, thanks.
No I mean it! I can’t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!|Oh you’re right. Thank you! What’s your name again?
Joey.|Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye—l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I’m really nervous about-about being you. Y’know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y’know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?|All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
Oh that’s great! Oh thank you so much!|You’re so welcome.
Hey! Now, I’ve been watching some tapes, how’s this?  "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"|Is that supposed to be me?
Yeah.|Yeah but Jessica doesn’t have an English accent.
Well, I feel like a snack!|Do you want some shortbread? Eh that’s Scottish like you are.
Oh no thanks. I don’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.|What?!
Well it’s just my entire family was run out of Scotland by…Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.|Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
We heard you play all the way from your apartment!|Were you the ones called the cops?!
That’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.|Why not?
Because we hate them.|Come on that’s not fair! I mean you haven’t even heard me play!
We have heard you play.|No, you’ve heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I’m not going to tell you what song I’m gonna play either. But uh, let’s just say when it’s over I’ll bet there will be a we bit o’ celebration.
So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room.  You try.|Okay!  All right!
No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He’s not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.|Okay. Okay.
Right. He’s not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!!  Oh well, I’m gonna miss this woman so much. I don’t know what I’m going to do! I mean, it’s been 20 years of my life.|Oh well—Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y’know? It’ll-it’ll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You’re so talented.
I am. I am, but I don’t know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.|Hey that’s not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb—Angelina Jolie!
I probably should’ve just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y’know I just got so comfy here! And… Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!|Like-like what?
Well, let’s just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!|Wow!
But… Well now, now’s a different time for me.|Oh hey come on, don’t-don’t-don’t do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I’m thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!"  Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
You think I’m hot?|You own the room.  We should probably get-get uh…
Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the…|Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that ‘cause she’s so passionate?
No! It’s because that way the camera only sees her!  Do you wanna try it?|Yeah! Okay.
Hey! Hey!|Who is it?
Well why shouldn’t I?!|Because it’s my apartment!
Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.|Okay. All right.  Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
You’re not the man who left the cell phone.|No that’s my assistant.
Is-is he coming?|Umm, no.
We’ll be right back sir.|Sure.
I don’t know!|Can you believe this?  We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
I know!  What?!|Hmm, they just don’t make ‘em like that anymore!
No-no they do but, you just have to wait.|Rachel, listen—I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!|Yeah! You’re such a great friend!
Ohh…|So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
Well, you certainly own that room.|Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
Well, it’s nice to know that you…|
Oh that explains all the women’s underwear.|Sure. Yep.
Certainly.|Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
I’d love to, but my lawyer said I can’t do that anymore.|God. You seem really, really nice.
I really can’t slap you.|You are so beautiful.
Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I’m used to it, don’t worry about it.|Oh my God!
What?|They sent me today’s script! They never send the script!
They don’t?|Well no, I’m just in a coma. This must mean I have lines!  Oh…
How does it happen?|Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!|Yeah well, I’m guessing after this she’s not going to be crazy about electricity either.
…now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.|I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
Do you wanna start telling secrets?|No!
So?|No!
Loosening the saddle on mother’s horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.|Thank you sweetheart.
I can’t believe she’s really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.|I don’t think so.
Who are you?!|What’s the matter Dina? Don’t you recognize your own  mother?!
You know the song! Sing along!|Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
Hi.|Hi! Hi Ben!
Hi, we have a little bathroom emergency.|Oh, yeah go ahead.
Uh, before we do uh, are any of Joey’s special romance magazines in there?|No. No.
Okay! All clear!|Thanks Phoebe!
Everything okay in there?|Don’t talk to me now!
Hey listen can you do me a big favor? The dean’s office just called and said there was an urgent meeting. Can you watch Ben for like an hour?|What-what about Monica?
Oh, she isn’t home.|So it would just be, me alone?
Well, Ben would be there.|Huh umm…
What’s the matter?|Well that—y’know it’s just uh, I’ve never done that before. Me and him alone.
Rach, he’s not an ex-con.|Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh, what do I, what do I do with him?
I don’t know! Just-just talk to him-entertain him and keep him alive.|Okay.
Okay.  Ben? Come here. All right, I’m gonna leave you here with Aunt Rachel for about an hour. Okay? Are you gonna be okay?|Yeah I think so.
I wasn’t talking to you.|I’ll be okay.
Okay, I’ll see you soon buddy.  Be back in an hour.|Bye dad.
What about the second minister we meet with? I kinda liked him.|You mean the spitter?
Come on! It wasn’t that bad!|Easy for you to say; you’ll be wearing a veil.
All right, what about the third guy?|You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
Can you blame him?|Sorry, I just don’t like the idea of when I say, "I do," he’s thinking, "Yeah, I’d do her too!"
Well then we still have a problem.|Yeah!
Well, we’re trying to find someone to perform our wedding and they’re all either boring or annoying or y’know, can’t stop staring at the ladies.|Oo! You should have one of us do it!
Phoebe, we’re getting married, married; not sixth grade married.|No! No! It’s-it’s uh a real thing! Anyone can get ordained on the Internet and perform like weddings and stuff!
Are you serious?|Yes! A friend of mine did it and it’s totally legal!
Ben y’know when uh, when you were a baby, you and I used to hang out all the time. ‘Cause I was, I was your daddy’s girlfriend.|But you’re not anymore!
No, I’m not.|‘Cause you guys were on a break.
Hey! We were not on a—Okay. That’s fine! Fine. Y’know what Ben? One day when you are a lot older I am going to tell you that entire story over a pitcher of real margaritas, okay?|When’s my daddy coming back?
So no-no brothers and sisters, huh? That must be nice. You don’t have to share stuff.|Sharing is good.
Oh, you’re one of those. But y’know what? I have two sisters of my own and we just-just tortured each other.|Really? Like how?
Well y’know, we would umm, repeat everything the other said, or uh, we’d jump out of closets to scare each other, or switch the sugar for the salt so they’d put salt on their cereal.|That’s a good one.
Yeah? You like that one?|Yeah, you’re funny.
I’m funny? Oh thank God! Well hey, I’ve got a ton of these! Umm, oh hear—Do you want a good one? Here’s a good one. Umm, you uh, you take a quarter, take a quarter and, and you blacken the edge. Right?  And then you say to person, I bet you can’t roll this quarter from your forehead to your chin without it leaving your face. And then when they do it, they’re left with a big black pencil line right down the center of their face.|Can I do it to you?
So, did you uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?|No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together.
Well then let me do it!|Joe…
No-no-no! Look, I’ve been thinking about it. I’m an actor right? So I won’t get nervous talking in front of people.|Joey look it’s really sweet…
No-no-no-no look no! I won’t spit, and I won’t stare at Monica’s breasts! Y’know? Everyone knows I’m an ass man!|That is true.
Yeah and the most important thing is that it won’t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It’ll be me! And I swear I’ll do a really good job. Plus, y’know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.|Y’know, we haven’t found anybody else.
So I can do it?|Yeah you can do it.
All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?|Yeah.
Okay.|Hey Pheebs, how’s it going?
Coming.|I have a bone to pick with you.
Uh-oh.|Yes! Ben learned a little trick.
Oh yeah? Did he pull the old…|That’s right! That’s right! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat so the pee goes everywhere!
Oh that.|Yeah that! You know I hate practical jokes! They’re mean and they’re stupid and-and I don’t want my son learning them!
Oh, come on! Saran Wrap on the toilet seat, you don’t think that’s just a little funny?!|I was barefoot. Now tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him right?
It’s amazing! My headache is completely gone! What are those pills called?|Hexadrin.
Oh, I love you Hexadrin!|No Phoebe, those are like the side affects and stuff.
Say what?|Y’know, the possible side affects.
Oh my God!  Dizziness, nervousness, drowsiness, facial swelling, nausea, headache—Headache. Vomiting, stomach bleeding, liver damage! Now okay, I don’t recall any of this coming up when you gave me these little death capsules! Oh I’m sorry, extra strength death capsules!|Phoebe, relax none of that stuff ever happens! They just put it on there for legal reasons!
Why?|In case it happens.
I have liver damage. Ow! Oh!|Phoebe, your liver is right here.
Okay, then I must be disoriented.|Anyway, I started working on what I’m going to say for the ceremony, do you wanna hear it?
Hey Rachel!|Hi!
What a nice surprise! What are you doing here?|Well y’know I was just in the neighborhood and I passed by your building and I thought to myself, "What’s up with Carol and sweet, little Ben?"
Can I ask what—Come on in.|Okay.
Umm uh, I’ll make some coffee and we can uh, chat.|I’d love that. I would loooove…  So uh, so where is sweet little Ben? I would love to have a little...
Rach, do you want some sugar in your coffee?|Yes oh— Okay, do you remember all that stuff I taught you yesterday?
I feel like my face is swelling.  Is my face swelling?|Phoebe, your face is fine! Come on, none of this stuff is going to happen to you! Stop being such a baby!
Oh, interesting you should call me that! Now that I may never have one!|Okay you guys, I got a little more written. Are you ready?
Did you ever feed him a poison capsule that made him bleed from the eyes?|It doesn’t say that!
Oh! Suddenly somebody knows all about the side affects!|See Joe, we want you to tell stories but y’know, romantic stories. Nice stories.
Hey!|Cute PJ’s! You’re really livin’ it up here in London huh?
Well I was… I was exactly expecting company after… 9:15.|Is Joey here?
Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the bride’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, you’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?|Wouldn’t you be?
Well, look it’s been a really emotional time y’know, and you’ve had a lot to drink. And you’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!|Really?
You kidding? You’re the most beautiful woman in most rooms…  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What’s going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?|Well, not anymore.
But we don’t do that.|I know, I just thought it would be fun.
How drunk are you?|Drunk enough to know that I want to do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
That’s the perfect amount!|Okay!
What?|This doesn’t feel weird!
I know.|You’re a really good kisser.
Well, I have kissed over four women.  Do you wanna get under the covers?|Hm-hmm!
Okay!|Wow! You are really fast!
It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.|We’re gonna see each other naked.
Yep!|Do you wanna do it at the same time?
Count of three?|One!
Two!|Two!
Well I think it’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.|Eh, we weren’t that close anyway!
Joey! Joey! Joey! J-J-Joey-Joey-J-Joey!|Hey!
Hey Joe! I was just watching a movie-e-e…|Oh, dude I’m so sorry!
No! No! No!|Hey no-no-no-no! It’s cool! It’s cool! I-I’ll only be a second, I’m still with my bride’s maid, I just—Where are those condoms you brought?
They’re in my bag over there.|Ah.
Uh, could you leave me one?|For just you?
Yeah.|Hey listen, why don’t you come downstairs with me? There’s some really nice girls down there.
No I-I-I’m fine.|All right, here you go buddy.
That’s what that was?! ‘Cause that other thing? I thought you were on to something, but it did nothing for me.|Okay, can we change the topic? Because it’s really doing nothing for me.
Oh…  Can you imagine if I hadn’t left you that last one? You two might’ve never gotten together. Ooh-ooh! Could you imagine if I sent that hooker up to the room like I was gonna?! It’s like it was in the stars!|Yeah, it’s totally meant to be.  Tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.
So you came to the room looking for Joey? Did you ever in-intend on telling me about this?|No because it-it didn’t seem important.
Oh, it’s not important? It’s not important?! If it wasn’t for a bride’s maid you’d be marrying him  not me!|Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!
I don’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and I’m runner up.|Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!
Look there is no way you’re doing this wedding now. Okay?|What?! That’s not fair! It’s not my fault! I was off with my bride’s maid! And who’s to say I would’ve even said yes?!  I mean I would’ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!
Okay, it’s just weird! Okay? I don’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I need…I don’t know what I need. I need a walk.|Wait Chandler come on, let’s—it’s not a big deal!
It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin.|This is crazy.
So now what have we agreed?|No more pranks.
And-and what else?|That you and daddy were not on a break.
Very good.|Rachel! What are you doing here?
I’m just visiting my good friend Carol.|Your good friend?
Yeah!|What’s her last name?
Carol…Lesbian?|Nice. And by the way that uh, that line down my face?
What line?|Wh-wh-what line? The line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh,  "Dude, don’t you ever was your face?"
All right, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you but you were so mad already!|Of course I was mad! I told you I-I hate this stuff! Okay? It-it’s not funny!
Okay, maybe they are not funny to you…|Oh my God!
Or Carol! But they’re funny to kids and who is it hurting?!|Uh, y’know what? I’ll tell you who it hurts! It hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal’s office wearing nothing but a catcher’s mitt!
That was you?! We heard about you in Junior High! Did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout, "I will be revenged?!"|I will be! Listen, I don’t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore. Okay?
Fine. Fine, but I’ll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel. And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I’ll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that’s what you want!|No that’s not what I want. Uh, I’m glad you guys were bonding but I…
Look he doesn’t have any brothers or sisters, somebody’s gonna have to teach him this stuff! And I haven’t taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn’t know anyway!|Crap!!
Hey.|Hey. Do you want this scone?  It came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you!
Chandler, come on nothing even happened!|Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding…
No-hey-no! If you don’t want me to do it, I except that. I don’t care about that. I just…I don’t want you to be upset.|How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
Yeah for like a half an hour one night! Chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life! You’re so lucky! Look what I missed out on by not being there! Although you know what? It could never have worked like you guys did, ‘cause you guys are perfect for each other. Y’know, we look at you and-and we see you together and it just…it-it fits. Y’know? And you just know it’s gonna last forever.|That’s what you should say.
What?|When you’re marrying us; that’s what you should say.
Really? I can do it?|I’d love it if you would do it.
Hey!|But those are the words! Those exact words!
Hey I’m sorry to do this to you again but uh, is there any way you can look after Ben for a little bit? I-I’ve got this meeting at school. And-and he-he asked for his uh, ‘Fun Aunt’ Rachel, so…|Ohhh! Well of course I will watch him! We have fun, don’t we Ben?
Okay, I’ll see you later pal.|Ohh, okay.  Wait a minute. Uh Ben, I can’t do it.
What?|I can’t let him go out that way, he’s got a meeting.  You’ve got something here on your back.
What?  What did we just finish talking about Ben?!|Oh I…
All right, that’s it!  Come—you—no! You are in big trouble young man!|No! Wait! Come on!
Wait! No! Ben, come here! I am not kidding!|No you guys…
I-I-am—|EHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! My God!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my God!!!!!!!
Hey!|Hey-hey.
So are guys doing okay?|Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important.
Honey! Dinner’s ready!|What’s my little chef got for me tonight?
Your favorite!|Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!
Yep! And lot’s of it!|Thanks sweetheart. Give me a little sugar here.  Okay.
Okay, in we go.|Here we go! Here we go! Here we go!  How you doin’?
Here you go.|That’s it! I’m out of the woods! Ohh! What a relief!
Good for you!|Oh, it’s like huge weight has been lifted! ‘Cause look,  no hair loss, not a rash, no hives, I’m just so happy! Because no shortness of breath, no temporary euphoria—Oh.
So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.|Food? Uh-huh gimme!
Chandler.|Gap commercial.  So did you book them? Did you call?
I will.|Do you want me to call?
No, I’ll do it. You just stick to your job.|What is your job?
There were only twelve.|Oh yeah, I added three.
What are peanut butter fingers?!|Oh yeah…
Well hello! She’s cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?|Sure! That’s one of the great things about being engaged. I’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
Uh yeah! Let me, let me get that for you.|It-it’s really heavy.
|I-I am Kristen.
Kristen, hi. Are you uh, new to the area, ‘cause if you are…I’d love to show you around sometime.|I…I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
Ah.|But-but this block is like a whole other world.
Y’know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.|Smooth.
Umm, say you’re gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?|Oh I’d like that.
Yeah?|Yeah.
Great! Uh, let me take this up for you.|After you.
Am I crazy or does this totally go?!|Oh my God! You look so beautiful!
Thank you Rachel but, look at Monica!|This is it. Yeah, this is the one. I can’t believe I found it!
Ooh, is that spelled with a ‘C’ or a ‘K’? Oh my God! It doesn’t matter; they’re both great!|Oh y’know what? Y’know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman’s and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.
Hi! You uh, movin’ in or movin’ out?|I’m moving in.
Oh uh, can I give you a hand?|Oh okay. But y’know what? Be careful. Because a guy was helping me before had to leave because he hurt his back.
Boyfriend?|No.
I’m Joey.|Kristen.
Oh wow, what a beautiful name!  What is it again?|Kristen.
Got it!  So…|So uh, do you live around here?
Yeah! Yeah! Right down there.  or you can wake up with your shoes gone.|I’ll remember that.
Okay. Yeah. Listen would you uh, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?|Oh I, I have plans tonight.
Oh.|But how about tomorrow?
Sounds great! Okay all right, well where does this go?|You look strong, why don’t I take that and you grab one of the boxes.
What is taking so long?! I mean whatever!|So this is Brooklyn.
Here he comes! Hurry!|Oh they’re pushing! They’re pushing!!
Let’s go!!|Hey! Rachel! Come on!!!!
Megan!|Monica!
You came?!|Yeah!
This is my dress!|No!
Yes it is! You saw me wearing it!|And now you’ll see me buying it.
What? You freak! You wouldn’t even have known about this place if it wasn’t for me!|Look, you don’t want to fight me.
|Hey!
Did you find the dress?|No! You gotta get me out of here Phoebe! These bargain shoppers are crazy!
I—We gotta get Monica.|No! You gotta hold my hand!!
Oh my God!!|Go! Go! Go!
So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?|Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she’d like to go out again.
Huh.|Yeah in fact, I’m gonna go call her right now. And I’ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says…
Hey!|Listen, sorry I didn’t stop by last night but I had a date.
Uh Joe, when it’s one o’clock in the morning and you don’t come by? That’s okay!|Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!
Really? Right across the street?|Yeah!
When’d you meet her?|Two days ago.
Excellent! Y’know Ross met somebody too!|Oh yeah?
Hi! How’d it go?|Oh great! We’re going out again Saturday. But I just found she’s also seeing some other guy.
Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross’s situation?|Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I’m dating this girl who’s also seeing another guy. But, I don’t know, I’m not to worried about it.
So this is nice! I wish I didn’t have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to.  Oh uh, by the way, what’s the name the girl you’re dating?|Kristen Lang.
Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.|Obviously! So, how do we decide?
Well now let’s-let’s look at this objectively, I think I should date her…|Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I’m the one who dates her.
That’s interesting, but check this out. I date her…|Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction…
Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.|Yeah well we should order some food then.
No Joey! Look why don’t, why don’t we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we’ll each go out with her one more time. And-and we’ll see who she likes best.|That sounds fair.
Maybe I’ll take her to that new French restaurant down the street…|Ah yeah—wait a second now! Look we’re gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don’t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
Well sorry, that’s what I do on dates.|All right, well I guess I’ll just have to do what I do on dates.
So let’s decide on the spending limit…|Yeah. Uh, …six dollars?
I was thinking more like a hundred.|Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
Oh…|I know. Hand me a tissue.
Hello?|What?!
That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn’t have them back unless I gave her the dress!|Does that mean Carcass is available?
What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh…Chandler wants the band. What do I do?|Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
How?|You’re out of toilet paper!
Hey!|Hey! What’s up?
I just wanted to come by and y’know, wish you good luck on your date.|Oh thanks!
Yeah. What time are you meeting her?|We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
Wow, that’s in like 20 minutes. You’d better get dressed.|I am dressed.
Oh. Well good!  What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?|I have an oily T-zone!
Okay dude!  Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.|That’s right.
You spent a hundred dollars. That’s the limit. You’re screwed!|Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn’t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
Oh-oh! So that’s the way it’s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y’know!|Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
I don’t know.|Why am I not surprised?
Y’know what Ross? I’m not gonna let you get away with this!|I don’t think you have much choice.
Well we’ll see!|Bye-bye!
Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?|Yes. Yes. Just here .
Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!|Yeah, swing music is so out.
What are you guys talking about?|Well umm, we were just talking about the y’know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y’know, they were the right way to go.
But I love swing music!|Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y’know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts—They just stop living.
Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there’s another reason too.|Well, what is the other reason?
I don’t want to say.|Well you have to because maybe it’s stupid.
Well it’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was…the first time I knew that…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.|Oh crap!
So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.|Oh great!
Yeah.|Is your back feeling better?
Oh yeah it’s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.|Kristen?
Hi.  It’s nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don’t anymore.|Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
Yeah. So…|Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?|Well Joey doesn’t like to talk about it but, he’s one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
That’s right! That’s right, don’t you play a woman?|A woman in a man’s body.
Much better.|So y’know Ross it’s funny ‘cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I’ve been married and how I have a son.|Yeah, little Eric.
That’s right! Wait no, Ben.|So you’ve just married the one time then?
Well umm…|You’ve been married twice?
Yes. And another time after that. Boy I’m getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?|You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?|Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
Hey you leave Marcel out of this!|Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!|Monkey lover!
Hi, honey! I’m home!|Don’t come in here!
Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?|No! We only mess around at his place!
Y’know it’s funny I started it but, now it’s scary me. So could you come out here please?|No, I’m wearing a wedding dress.
Oh you got a wedding dress? That’s great!|Yeah but I’m not keeping it.
Well then why can’t I see it?|Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can’t like it.
Okay I promise. I’ll-I’ll hate it.  Wow! You-you look…hideous.|Really?
Yeah, that’s like the most ugliest dress I’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?|Oh because it doesn’t…really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
Oh that’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it’s like yuck! It’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!|Okay! But you can’t rip it. Well, maybe a little.
Guys?|I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.|Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we’re gonna have younger looking skin!
Hey! You guys! You’re not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent…|Oh my God!  I’m sorry, too soon. You go.
Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!|Joey!
No-no.|Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
No! I’m up for a Soapie!|Honey? Is that something you’re making up?
No, no, no! It’s real! And it has been since 1998.  Hey Rach! Rach! I’m up for a Soapie!|Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I’m taking to the awards.|Oh, stop that! Don’t kid about that!  Will all the stars be there?
Many are scheduled to appear.|Oh my God! Oh my God! I can’t go! I’m gonna be too nervous!
…and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it’s collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it’s predator.  Yes Mr. Lewis?|What kinda noise?
Just a high pitched intimidating noise.|But like how?
Well we-we don’t know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this.  Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?|Yes sir.
Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I’m afraid I-I had to fail you.|Why?!
Well you need 60% to pass…|What’d I get?
Seven.|That’s not so good.
No-no it’s not. What-what happened there Ned?|Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I’m sort of in love.
Well I’m sorry but, that-that’s really not my problem.|I’m in love with you.
Well that brings me in the loop a little.|You see, that’s why I did so bad on this test. I’m having a hard time concentrating. When you’re up there  You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater…
Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!|Really?  My God, he’s really cute.
Go for it.|Phoebe, I’m engaged!
I’m just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can’t perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.|Hi!
my parents, who’ve always been there for me. I’d also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel…|I’m fourth!  Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
Yeah may-maybe you don’t tell anyone about this.|What? No! It’s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
Really?|Yeah.
What award are you practicing for?|Grammy, Best New Artist.
Oh, hey listen! The Soapie’s called today and I also get to present an award.|Ohh that’s great!
Yeah!|So you’ll definitely get onstage, even if you don’t win.
What you-you don’t think I’m gonna win?|Well of course I do! But y’know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you’re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it’s just…I’ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.|Well Joey, you’ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y’know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y’know? So it’s sorta like…
Hey!|Y’know?
You practice losing the Grammies too?|Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
Oh hey!|Hey! How’d your date go with Jake?
Oh, great! We couldn’t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y’know, he’d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.|Okay, stop it Phoebe, you’re getting me all tingly.
All I could think of was y’know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"|And did he?
I’m a lady Monica, I don’t kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.|Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
I just like him so much that I just feel like I’ve had 10 drinks today and I’ve only had six.|Oh, I haven’t had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I’m never gonna have that feeling again am I?
You sound like a guy.|No, a guy would be saying, "I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I’m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I’ve been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I’d be giving up! I mean, I…I’m never gonna have a first kiss again.
Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?|Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
There’s this kid in my class who said he’s in love with me.|Whoa!
I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There’s a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.|Really?
Yeah! I don’t know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of…sexy professor vibe?|Not right now.
It-it—The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.|Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y’know you—I couldn’t concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what’s it’s like to be 19 and in love.
Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.|Yeah.
Bye Phoebe.|Okay bye.
All right. Bye.|Bye!  We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
I miss you already!!|
This is it! This is my category.|I know! My God! Do you have your speech?
Yeah, I got my speech!|Do you got your gracious loser face?
Yeah.|Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!
Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?|On TV?! Yeah!
…in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are: John Wheeler from General Hospital …Gavin Grant from The Young and the Restless!|What the?!
Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.|
Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!|Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
Oh my God you stole her award!|No-no! No, I’m accepting it on her behalf.
Joey I don’t think you know what behalf means.|Sure I do! It’s a verb! As in, "I behalfin’ it!"
Joey, you have got to take this back!|But why?! I should’ve won one and I really want it and she didn’t even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
No! Joey!|Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of ‘em.
Do you really want an award you didn’t win?|No! I want an award I did win! But nobody’s giving me any of those! Plus—Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there  right? When people come over they’ll see it and they’ll think I won it.
Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!|I can scratch that right off.
Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don’t want to win an award this way. You’re very talented. And someday you’re gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.|All right!
All right?  Thank you.|I’ll take it back tomorrow.
Thank you.|
Professor Geller?|Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
I know I didn’t do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.|And why exactly would I do that?
Because I’m in love with you.|What?!
Yeah, I’m all…in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?|No!
Well why not you changed Ned’s grade!|Well that’s different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
No he’s not! He’s totally yanking your chain! He’s done this with three other teachers!|What?
He’s got a girlfriend!|I can’t believe someone would do that for a grade.
Have you seen Chandler?|No. Why?
‘Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I’m not gonna have and it’s freaking me out. I don’t know what to do about it.|Okay, don’t sweat it.
Phoebe! Come on I’m serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.|No that is the last thing you want to do!
Why?|Because you’re marrying him!
You gotta help me out here Pheebs.|All right, I’ve never been engaged and I’ve never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
So I’m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I’m gonna spend the rest of my life with?|That is correct! Yes, you’re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
Your mother told you this?|Yes!
The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?|Oh my God! You’re right! Go!
I cannot believe I’m gonna meet Jessica Ashley!|Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
Okay, I’m totally cool!|Come in.
Hey Jess.|Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
‘Sup?|Uh listen, here’s your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
Absolutely.|Y-y-yeah!
Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?|Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
You’re wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?|Kinda. They’re really big.
Doesn’t it ever just freak you out that-that you’re never gonna be with anybody new again?|What?
Just, I love you so much. Just…It’s just sometimes it bothers me that I’m never gonna have that feeling. Y’know when you meet someone for the first time and it’s new and exciting? Y’know that rush?|No. No, see when I first meet somebody it’s uh it’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
Okay, but all right you’re a guy, does it not freak you that you’re never gonna sleep with anybody else?|Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I’m afraid even more sweating.
Even with me?|I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.  Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
Really?|Well yeah! But now that I know that you’re having these thoughts, I’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh I’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
Come here! Come here!  Sweetie you don’t have to worry. No, besides y’know what? I’m gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid…|Water! Water! Water!
Uh Mr. Morse, can I speak to you for a moment?|That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I’m changing your grade back.|What?! Why?
‘Cause I know what you’re trying to pull here. Okay? It’s not gonna work.|I’m not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
Rach?|I’ll be out in a second.
Oh.  It’s just so unexpected! I…I uh…Boy I’ll tell you it’s just such an honor to be nominated for a Nobel Prize and y’know to win one for a massage. Especially after having just won a Tony award for best actress in…|Honey, we have to go. Our reservations are at 8:00.
…in Reservations at 8:00 by Neil Simon.|Okay honey, you can finish this later we’re gonna be late. We gotta go.
Oh hey! How was your audition?|I’m sorry, do I know you?
What are you doing?|Nothing, I’m just practicing blowing you off because I’m gonna be a big movie star!
Oh! You got it?!|Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
The next, next?|Yeah, there’s this guy from Chicago who’s supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy’s right after him.  Hello!
What’s the matter?|They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?|Yeah. But a part of me also can’t wait ‘til it’s over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
Sure.|I gotta make up the guest bedroom.  Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
Hey!|Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
Yeah!|Subtle guys!
What?!|I know you’re planning my surprise bridal shower.
Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?|I don’t know! It’s not like it’s porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y’know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
That’s what you say about porn.|You’re right. Maybe I shouldn’t even go on the call back.
No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!|Well that’s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character’s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It’s really sweet and-and tender.
Well when can we have this shower?|She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday…
Well that’s only two days away. What is the other option?|Yesterday!
Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We’re done!|Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can’t do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There’s just too much to do! It’s impossible! We can’t do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
Rachel, calm down!|Okay. I’m sorry. You’re right, you’re right.
Just calm down woman!|Phoebe, I already, I already did.
Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.|Okay. Okay.  I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
Uh, here. What time?|4 o’clock. Food?
Finger sandwiches and tea.|Ooh great! Very Monica.
And chili!|Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
Both!|We’re paying for this y’know.
Neither.|Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
Lusts of the flesh.|What?
Hey!|Hey!
Y’know I’m-I’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.|Oh boy me too!
Y’know I was thinking if we had a…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours…|Yeah?
Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!|The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
That’s me! Come on!|Okay.  But wait, we can’t. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we’re supposed to have lunch.
Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.|Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
Hi! Nice to meet you!|Nice to meet you too.
Cassie needs to stay at your place.|What—why?
Because Purvry Perverson over here can’t stop staring at her.|What?! Chandler she’s our cousin!
You were staring about eight inches south of there.|Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.|Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
Hey, I’m back!|Hi-hi Joey.
Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?|Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn’t need to come down here today.
Oh great! Y’know I would’ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y’know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!|Wait Joey! You didn’t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
And scene! Huh? Wasn’t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?|Well, the director thinks you’re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
Wow! Sure! That’s great!|Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it’s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.|Terrific! Well uh, there’s one more thing. Uhh, uh it’s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she’s never seen a naked man who wasn’t Jewish. So…
So…What?|So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I’m saying?
Yes!|Okay.
No. What?|An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be…
So to get this part you can’t be?|Nope.
But you are?|Yep.
But you told them you weren’t?|That’s right.
Wow! Wow! And it’s definitely all gone? There’s nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?|I don’t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell ‘em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to…grow a turtleneck!|I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!|I just have to call my agent and tell her I can’t do the part.
Unless!|Unless what?
Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.|Like what?
Hey! I’ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone’s names in them and inside is everyone’s individual birth stone.|Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don’t have a guest list.
Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that’s coming? Me. Are you?|Hey!
Hey!|Hey! What’s up Mon?
Okay but look! Look at what I got! It’s her address book!  We have a guest list!|Oh my God you’re amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
Cassie?!|Hey Ross!
Hey!|It’s been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
Oh. Oh, that’s right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn’t.|Ah yeah, sorry about that.
It’s okay. Come, come on in.|Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica’s place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
Oh.|Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.|Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
Cassie, how you-how you doin’ on that…hot dog.|I’m all done.
Thank God.|I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you ‘til you cried?  We’re probably too old to do that now.|I’ll always remember that summer, because it’s when I got all of these freckles.
Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I’ll always remember that summer because that’s when I realized that we are related.|It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
Hi!|Hi!
How are you?  Hi, thanks for coming.|Oh thank you.
Thank you.  Oh, it’s so nice to see you.|No.
Okay.  Hey Rach?|Yeah?
Who the hell are all these people?|Well, I don’t know. I called all the people in Monica’s phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
Hmm, y’know there’s another word for people like that. Losers!|Hi! I’m Rachel. This is Phoebe. I’m the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
You were supposed to tell her!|No I wasn’t! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
Fine, I’ll go call her.|Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.|Wow! This looks great!
Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.|And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
Oh, just until the glue dries.|Thank God!
Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.|Ah.
Okay?  Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it’s gonna shrink.|Well maybe we just take that one away.
I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that’s really just for me.  Okay. So, why don’t you go into your room and try these on and we’ll see—get a better idea of what’s gonna work.|Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
Toothpick?|Yeah.
What are you trying on now?|The fruit roll up.
And?|Delicious.
Joey!|Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
What?! Which one?!|The Silly Putty! It’s not so silly anymore!
Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I’m going in.|Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
Phoebe! Rachel! It’s Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice!  Oh.|Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
For what?|Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
You al-you already had it?|Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
Well no wait a minute that’s not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.|What do you, what do you mean?
Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents  without having to talk to people I don’t even like!|Surprise…
And what’s cool is, the character is from Naples, right?|Yeah.
My whole family’s from Naples!|Oh that’s great! Okay, well I’ve heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie…
Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?|Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
Oh! No problem! I…|What?
Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?|Probably Monica and Chandler.
Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don’t think I have the energy for this.|
Melissa!|You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters, what’s up with you?!
Wh—|So last I heard you were gonna get married.  Oh poor Ray-ray.
Oh no-no, no! It’s good! It’s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph Lauren!|Shut up!
I will not! I’m the divisional head of men’s sportswear!|Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?
Oh please…|Are you?!
No.|Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow night?
Oh tomorrow, oh I don’t know. Um…|You do now. You’re having dinner with me.
Shut up.|I-I’ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray!
Oh, wow thanks!  Oh you’re in real estate!|Oh no, that’s-that’s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.
Wow! What do you do now?|
Okay!|Hey guys! Look who’s back! It’s Ray-ray!
Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.|She seems really, really fun!
She’s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.|Wait a minute, she isn’t… She’s not the one who you…
Yes.|Wow!
It’s not a big deal!|They were lovers.
No we weren’t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y’know, ended up…kissing for a bit.|So that’s two of my wives.
|Oh wow. Why don’t we just take me  These pins aren’t for playing are they?
Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are yours.|This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.
Chandler, relax it’s not a contest.  Certainly not a close one.|Hello!
Okay, I think that’s it. The seating chart is done. This is our wedding. They all look like they’re having fun don’t they?|Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?
Oh!  you’re parents will be at home in Queens.|What they’re not invited?! Oh no, that’s terrible! They’re gonna be crushed!
Why would they think they’re invited?|You got me. I don’t…
Joey!|Well, I’m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y’know? Your parents are comin’! Chandler’s parents are comin’! Ross’s parents are comin’!
Ross’s parents are my parents!|Well-well—see? Parents are comin’!
Oh please, you just want more blue pins.|Well this is just sad!
All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!|That is not a problem.
But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.|Well, thanks a lot for hookin’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.
I’m Monica’s maid of honor. Okay? Don’t try to blue pin me!|Well, what’s the deal with these? These-these look nice.
Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then when they’re done with them they just send ‘em back.|You mean like for award shows?
Some of them.|You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"
Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little less E!?|Okay, who wore those?
Umm, well let’s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.|Not bad.
This one is uh Paul O’Neil.|Who’s that?
He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while, have it on in the background.  Ooh, this one was Pierce Brosnan!|Pierce Brosnan?
Uh-huh.|Are you serious?
Yeah.|007?! This is James Bond’s tux?!
It’s a pretty cool tux.|Oh, it’s not just that, I would be England’s most powerful weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty’s secret service. A man who fears no one; with a license to kill.  Would Monica let me wear this?
We should really learn how to play the real way.|I like our way. Oh!  Chess!
Nice move.|Yeah.
Hey!|Hey!
No, I’m performing the ceremony. I’m not wearing a tux.|Well, what are you going to wear?
Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.|Huh. Does Monica know about this?
I don’t think so.|Can I please be there when you tell her?
Can I come?! I won’t even talk! You’ll just hear the noise from my video camera.|What is this? What’s going on?
Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!|Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey’s lewd version?
Okay…|Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid mistake of telling Joey that one time…she and I y’know…kissed a little bit.
Hey.  It happened!|Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes!
Why are you taking this away from me?|Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!
Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding!|A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman’s tux!|What?
That’s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the hit film…that Batman film he was in.|You can’t wear that! I’m wearing the famous tux! James Bond’s tux!
So?|So—If you wear that you’ll make mine less special.
Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.|Please, don’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!
Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.|Look, it’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you.
When I got married you slept with my sister.|That was pretty 007.
Hey.|Hey. Oh good-good you’re here! All right, I figured it out. I’m gonna take two tables of eight, I’m gonna add your parents, and I’m gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two extra meals, we are good to go!
Yeah, they’re not coming.|What?!
Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They…feel a little unwanted.|Oh that’s too bad. It’s true, but too bad.
Look Mon, if you could just call my mom…|Oh Joey!
Come on! Look just-just tell—let her know that you really want them to be there. Let’s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years.|No she hasn’t.
Is it her fault that some of them didn’t make it to you?|Well, what am I going to say?
I don’t know. Just uh, just tell ‘em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or—No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don’t think you can blame it on them so…|
…anyway, his name is Allan and we’ve been going out for three years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for his girlfriend at the time. Oh well.  And he was Theta Beta Pi at Syracuse.|Oh. Oh, that’s great!
Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?|Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.
What one?|Yeah! Y’know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.
Oh, isn’t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?|Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh, tellin’ Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I uh, we made out.
What?|Remember?! We—come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the coconut bikini tops…
Yeah?|…we went back the house and we got really silly and we…we made out.
Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you’re talking about.|Really?!
Ross is Batman!|Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.
Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!|What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!
Batman has a utility belt!|007 has a fancy car!
Batman has the Batmobile!|007 gets all the ladies.
Batman has Robin!  We get ESPN right?|How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I’ll make you a nice martini.
Actually, I don’t like martinis.|How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?
Ooh, yum!|Hey.
How can you not remember us kissing?!|I don’t know. I don’t remember a lot of things that never happened.
Wh… Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We couldn’t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin’ together?|Oh, somewhere Joey’s head is exploding.
Yeah—but come on—Listen, I’m sorry I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn’t believe me.|I’m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it. Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.
No!!|Rachel, it’s okay. You don’t have to do this. I believe you. All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.
Thank you Phoebe.|She didn’t.
Hey!|You just carry that around?
Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece.|Between you and…
Gunther.  Hey-hey! Why don’t we put them on? Y’know get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.|I would but mine doesn’t fit. The pants are a little tight.
Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes together.|Well, does that mean that you’re not going to wearing yours?
What are you kidding? It’s Batman’s tux!!|Let me try it on!
Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin’ in there.|What’s this?
What?|An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didn’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
Let me see that!  Oh man!|The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
It happened! I am telling you it happened!|Okay.  Take care you guys.
What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute!|My God! You love me!
What?|Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can still hear the coconuts knockin’ together I…
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!|Aww, look who’s being suddenly shy. You can’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.
I-I-I-I’m just…I’m just a good kisser!|Shut up!
I’m sorry!|
What the hell was that?!|I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
And?|I’ve had better.
All right! I found one that fits!|Well y’know what they say, the 23rd time’s the charm.  Aww, look at you all handsome!
Whose is it?|Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.
Oh, come on! I don’t care! Come on! Whose is it?|Diane Keeton.
Do you realize that four weeks from today we’re getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!|Do you realize you get louder each week?
There’s still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?|I figured I’d buy those. Pat, I’d like to buy a vow.
Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.|Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
No! But I know exactly what I’m going to say.|Do you happen to know what I’m going to say?
|Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What’s wrong with me? Ooh, don’t open that door.
There are no words! This should not be this hard!|All right, uh…  Oh hey, you’ve done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
Monica what?|What?!
What is the emergency?!|You have to help me! I’m supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.|Thank you.
Well, why don’t you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.|Yeah, I’m not sure I can do that.
...everyone, this is Chandler!|Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
All right, there’s a nuclear holocaust, I’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?|Ennnh.
Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!|Well maybe you don’t talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y’know all the things that he’s taught you. Like…  Or all the things you taught him.
Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. , five, six, and seven!|That’s one?
It’s kind of an important one!|Oh, y’know-y’know what, I was looking at it upside down.
Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica…|Monica…
"…when I look back over our time together…"|Yeah?
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.|No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
|
Nice try.|Wait, wait, wait!
Look, Monica…|Look!
This is not going to work.|I bet this will work!
You are so great! I love you!|What?
Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!|You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
No I didn't!|Yes, you did!
Y’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?|Then all your stuff would be here.
Well, what if all my stuff was here?|Then you’d be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn’t make any sense.
You wanted it to be a surprise.|Oh my God.
Chandler… In all my life… I never thought I would be so lucky.  As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!|Okay!  Monica, will you marry me?
Yes.|Can we come it yet?! We’re dying out here!
Hey!|Hey!
How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?|How’s Monica coming along with her vows?
Has it been that long?!|Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!|I've had a very long, hard day.
Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?|Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
Okay.|Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
I don’t know why they didn’t just tell us.|I know! I mean it’s not like we weren’t cool about it.
And-and you?!|Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
How?! When?!|It happened in London.
IN LONDON!!!|The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!|No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
I can't wait to be with you!  I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.|
Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big…|Arghh!!
Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!|What?!
Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!|Oh my God!
CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!|OH MY GOD!!!
OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!|Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!|I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
YOU KNOW?!!!|Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?|Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.|Bye!
Phoebe knows about us!|Well I didn't tell them!
I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye!  Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!|Are you kidding?!
No!|I can not believe he would do that to Mon—Whoa!  Joey, do they know that we know?
God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey, you can't say anything!|I couldn't even if I wanted too.
Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!|She's bluffing!
He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.|Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
Joey!  Wow, you didn’t rip off any buttons.|It's not my first time.
You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!|Okay, give me a second!  Did you clean up in here?
Oh, you're-you're going?|Umm, not without you, lover.  So, this is my bra.
It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.|You should be. I'm very bendy.  I'm gonna kiss you now.
Not if I kiss you first.|Ooh.
Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.|Here it comes. Our first kiss.
Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!|And why not?!
Because I'm in love with Monica!!|You're-you're what?!
Love her! That's right, I…LOVE…HER!!! I love her!!  I love you, Monica.|I love you too Chandler.
Y’know, you’re friend’s getting married, it’s gotta change things.|You really think it would be that different?
How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they’re gonna be having kids, and then they’re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they’re gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.|Well, things change.
Hey, who's this little naked guy?|That little naked guy would be me.
Aww, look at the little thing.|Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?|Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
Hey, you guys!|Hey.
Oh that’s so sweet.|So we both finished our vows.
Yeah, I don’t hear Chandler’s and he doesn’t hear mine.|Okay.
Chandler!!|Don’t worry honey, we’ll make yours funnier.
Okay, what do you guys think?|Dude!
You really like it?|Dude! How-how did you write this?
I stole Monica’s and changed the name.|You can’t do that!
Hey!|Hey!
Hey uh Mon, I saw the Porsche parked out front, can I get the keys? Thought I’d take that bad boy out for a little spin.|Wait a minute!  You let Ross drive the Porsche and when I ask you, you say you’re the only one who’s allowed to drive it.
It’s a car Monica! Not a rocket ship!|Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you’re done.
Hey!|Hey!
Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I’ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.|Yeah, you got a couple hours?
Whew! That was a brisk ride!|Take the top down did ya?
Only way to fly.|Come on Ross give me the keys! Monica does not know what she’s talking about! I am an excellent driver!
You’re fast and irresponsible. That adds up to a bad driver.|Well in High School, that added up to head cheerleader.
Did you see the look that girl just gave me? Huh? She must’ve seen me cruising in the bad boy.|I think she’s checking out your beehive Ross.
What?!  Give-give me a brush.|Gimme the keys!
No way!|Well no brush!
Fine! Y’know what? It doesn’t matter, because, if I remember correctly, there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom.|
Chandler, we still haven’t gotten an RSVP from your dad.|Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that’s because I didn’t send him an invitation.
Chandler! He’s your father; he should be at the wedding.|I don’t even know the man. Okay? We’re not the close. I haven’t seen him in years.
Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn’t even asked?!|Well he doesn’t have to know! It’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas.
So what! As long as he’s not wearing a white dress and a veil I don’t care.|Okay, I think I need to do some shopping.
My God!|What do you think you’re doing?!
Just washing the windshield.|There is no way I am letting you drive this car! So why don’t you just hand over the keys?
Oh.|No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car!
Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!|With you?! Yeah right!
All right.|
What are you doing?! Get in the front!|In the death seat?!!
Hey guys!|Hey!
Ready to go?|Yeah! Sure! Ooh, I left my purse up at Monica’s. I’ll be right back.
Wait a minute!|What?
Over a month.|Wow! Maybe uh, maybe you and I ought to get to know each other a little better.
Sure, I’d like that.|So uh, what’s your name?
Its Jake.|Joey.  Hey Jake, do you like the Knicks?
Here!|What’s this?
It’s your suitcase. We’re going to Las Vegas.|Are you serious?! I mean like eloping?! No more stupid wedding stuff?! No more these flowers or these flowers or these flowers—Think of the money we’ll save!!  We’re not eloping. I love the flowers. Can our wedding be bigger please?
We’re going to Las Vegas to see your dad. It’s time you two talked, and I want to get to know my father-in-law.|Y’know we already went over this and I won!
No you didn’t. Oh and honey just so you know, now that you’re marrying me, you don’t get to win anymore.|Look forget it okay? I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. I don’t wanna.
Chandler, look I-I know that your dad embarrassed you. I know…|No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, you’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. Y’know it’s hard enough to be fourteen. You’re skinny. You’re wearing speedoes—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and there’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!
Hey, the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on! Okay? That’s a, that’s a pretty great dad.|He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
Who’s Mr. Girabaldi?|Does it matter?!
Chandler, you’re not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it’s time that you let that stuff go. If your father’s not at your wedding…you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.|Yeah o-okay, but I’m just doing this for you.
Yes!|So I really never get to win anymore?
Pheebs!|Hey!
Listen, you know how uh, when you’re wearing pants and you lean forward I check out your underwear?|Yeah!
Well, when Jake did it I saw that…he was wearing women’s underwear!|I know. They were mine.
Oh.  No! No wait, that’s weird!|No, it’s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.
That’s weird!|I’m wearing his briefs right now.
That’s…kinda hot.|I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.
Yeah, I wouldn’t know about that.|And! Y’know what Jake says? That women’s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.
Yeah well next thing you know, he’ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!|There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I’m thinking even more than you.
Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.|I’m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women’s underwear! I don’t think you could ever do that.
Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.|Okay whatever.
God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have got to get my license renewed.|You don’t have a valid driver’s license—Okay that is it! Pull over right now!
Oh Ross you’re so tense! You just gotta relax okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax…|What-what are you doing?! Are you—Okay that’s not funny! Just stop horsing around!
Uh-oh.|Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble.
Really? You think so?|I was talking to myself! You’re going down!
Has someone taken your order yet?|Uh oh yeah, she did. Uh, he did.  I’m-I’m sorry I’m new. I don’t…
Okay. Switch places with me! Switch places with me! Come on! I’ll go under, you go over!|Yeah, I’ll get right on that.
Oh come on Ross!!|No Rach! Come on! No-no! Yeah, I’m sure we won’t get arrested for this.
Hi officer, was I going a little too fast?|Oh my God.
Oh yes, absolutely! Y’know, it’s weird uh, but I had a dream last night where I was stopped by a policeman. And then he uh…well I probably shouldn’t tell you the rest.|Your license?
Yes. Here you go Officer uh, Handsome.|That’s Hanson.
Oops sorry, my mistake.|Dear Lord!!
Really?! You think so? Y’know, I had just rolled out of bed.|Yeah? Well you look phenomenal.
Y’know you’re-you’re probably wondering about the old date on there.|Yes I am.
Yeah.|You’re an Aquarius, huh?
I bet you’re a Gemini.|Nope.
Taurus?|Nope.
Virgo?|Nope.
Sagittarius?|Yep.
I knew it! I knew it, ahh….|Well I tell you what…
Yeah?|You’re not gonna speed anymore right?
I won’t speed.|And you promise you’ll get this taken care of right away?
I promise.|And in the meantime you better let him drive. Does he have a license?
Yeah!|Can he handle the stick?
Oh well…|I can handle the stick!!
I feel pretty. Oh so pretty. I feel pretty and witty and…|Gay!
|He’s coming into the audience. He’s coming into the audience.
Where are you from?|Bakersfield.
I’m sorry?|Bakersfield!
No-no I heard! I’m just sorry.|It can’t happen like this. Okay? I’ll meet you back at the hotel.
|Can we have our drinks please?! Waiter—Uh, tress!
Hey Pheebs!|Hey!
Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!|Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
Y’know, I’m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.|Uh-huh.
The silk? Feels really good!|Huh.
Yeah! And-and things aren’t as…smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.|That’s great Joe!
Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men’s underwear!|Uh-huh.
Bikini, French cut, thong! And-and the fabrics! You’ve got cotton, silk, lace! And y’know what I’ve always wondered about?|Hmm?
Pantyhose! Y’know? They way they start at your toe and go all the way up to here…  I should go take these off shouldn’t I?|I think it’s important that you do.
So what’s your name?|
Chandler? What an unusual name! You must’ve had terribly fascinating parents.|Oh, they’re a hoot.
And who is your friend?|I’m-I’m Monica.
Monica! Where are you from?|New York.
I’m not very fond of New York. Queens I like.  Honey! Huh?|Actually Monica and I are engaged.
Really?! Congratulations. When’s the big day?|In…in two weeks.
So you’re bald?|Wait! Wait! We’d really love it if you could be there.
We?|I know it would make me happy, ma’am.
Well I wouldn’t miss it for the world. Oh! I’m getting all misty here! You’d think I was having my legs waxed or something.|You okay?
Before we go on with the show, I just want to say to the bride and groom how lucky they are to have found each other. In every life, a little rain must fall. Fortunately, in my life…  It’s raining men!|Hallelujah!
It’s raining men!|Amen!
Remind me to introduce you to someone!|Who?
Fourth gear!!|What?! What does he want?! I wasn’t doing anything!
Well maybe he saw your hand slip briefly from the ten and two o’clock position.|Maybe it’s uh Sergeant Sagittarius coming back to flirt some more!
It’s a different guy!|Good evening officer.
Oh my God!|Your license please.
You have a son!|I know. I know.
Feel better?|Yeah! Much! Listen uh, not that I’m y’know insecure about my manhood or anything y’know, but I think I need to hook up with a woman like right now.
Yeah, I understand.|Yeah! Okay!  Hey! Hi!
Do you realize this is probably the last time we’ll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?|Why?! What’s happening to the coffee house?!
Old?|The young hot ball and chain.
That’s much better.|
We’re gonna pick up the wedding dress then we’re gonna have lunch with mom.|Ah. Joey you’re-you’re having lunch with my mom?
What ‘cha doing Mon?|I’m making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
Hey! Those are all the things I’m responsible for!|I had to go with the odds Rach.
The commercial?|No!
Oh that’s great!|Wait! Wait! Wait! You can’t start today! Today’s the rehearsal dinner!
Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.|Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I?
You’re gonna be late! Go! Go!|Who did we fight in World War I?
Mexico?|Yes! Very good.
Hey Joey! We’re ready.|Yeah! Me too.
Joey Tribbiani? This is Richard Crosby he’s playing Vincent.|I’m doing my scenes with you?
Honey, we gotta go!|Okay. Here’s a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
I don’t have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.|Yes, include more people in this.
Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we’ll be getting married?|Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
I just, I can’t believe that we made it!|Well you don’t have to sound so surprised.
I’m sorry but…nothing.|What?
Well…honestly ever since we got engaged I have been waiting for something to, to flip you out.|Honestly? Me too.
Really?|Yeah. Y’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and I’ll go all…Chandler. But nothing has.
Ohh, I’m so glad. Thank you so much for staying so calm during this. I mean it’s really, it’s made me stay calm.  I coulda been worse!|Okay. I’ll be right there.
Hey Maureen!  Gosh! Hey uh, Chandler? This is my cousin Maureen.|We’re the Bings.
What is that?|Well I…I told him that if he ever hurt you I would hunt him down and kick his ass!
Mrs. Bing? Here, these are my parents umm, Judy and Jack Geller.|It’s lovely to meet you.
Dad! There’s Ross , why don’t you go talk to him?|I didn’t even have a chance to act as though I’m okay with it!
Hi Mr.…Bing.|Nora!
It-it’s so great to see you both here.|Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren’t you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
…of course you can kick his ass son.|You could kick anyone’s ass you want too.
Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler’s dad and try to keep him away from Chandler’s mom?|Yeah! But I don’t know what he looks like!
He is the man in the black dress.|Man in the black dress…  Hi! I’m Rachel! I’m a friend of Monica and Chandler’s!
All right, I’m gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?|I’ll do it.
Who wants it? Anybody?|I said I’ll do it!
Nobody wants to do it? All right, I’ll do it myself.|Monica! I’m not gonna screw it up!
Y’know what? You’re right, I’m sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.|Well of course that is what I’m here for!
Okay. Sorry.|Ugh!  What grandmother?
Hey! Where have you been?|Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
Oh.|What? Are you going back to work?
Yeah.|Nice shades.
Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won’t get spit in the eyes, y’know?|And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
Great! All right. I’ll see you later.|Hey, where’s Chandler?
Uh, I think he’s in Rachel’s room. See ya.|
Hey!|Hi!
Is uh, is Monica here?|She’s steaming her dress, why? What’s up?
I think Chandler’s gone.|What?!
He left that.|Tell Monica I’m sorry.
Oh my God! Chandler just left though!|Yeah but, maybe it’s not what we think. Maybe it’s tell Monica I’m sorry I…drank the last of the milk.
Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he’s changed his name, y’know? Tell Monica I’m sorry.|I think it means he freaked out and left!
Don’t be so negative! Good God! Isn’t it possible that Sorry is sitting in there  right now?!|Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
Okay but if you don’t find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!|I will, I will find him.
Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?|Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
Just the last two pages.|All right.
I found the picture!|Picture? What picture?
Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.|Okay uh, look I know you’re a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff…
Oh, thanks.|But you’re spittin’ all over me man!
Well of course I am!|You know you’ve been spitting on me?!
That’s what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!|Wow! Didn’t know that.
Great!|Thanks! Okay-okay check it out!  Eh?
Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?|No. No, I haven’t seen him.
Oh damn!|He’s getting married tomorrow right?
Yes. Yes. Don’t worry. Everything’s fine. We’ll uh, we’ll see you tomorrow at the wedding.|I wasn’t invited.
Well then we’ll-we’ll see you the day after tomorrow.  What-what…what you guys doing here?!|Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we’d see what all the fuss is about.
Why?!|The sexy blonde behind the counter.
Gunther?!|Your mother just added him to her list.
What? Your-your list?|Yeah, the list that—of people we’re allowed to sleep…
Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I’m looking for him?|And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I’m looking for her.
Action!|I found the picture!
Cut! Wonderful!|Great scene yeah?
Ross said there’s still no word from Chandler.|Oh man.
Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.|Okay. Well there’s one down.
God! Don’t—We can’t let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she’ll be in the gown and then he won’t show up and then she’s gonna have to take off the gown…|Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can’t do this here!
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s just…It’s just so sad!|Yeah, but you’ve got to pull yourself together! Monica can’t see you like this! Then she’ll know something’s wrong!
I know. I know. Oh God.  There’s no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?|Yeah.  Oh, that’s gone too. This is Monica’s bathroom right?!
Oh!|No-no! I-I…I found one.
Oh thank you!  Can I have another one?|
Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn’t show up!|Oh here’s a whole bunch.
Oh, I mean she’s gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y’know? Then she’ll have to come back here and live all alone.|Oh my God!
What?|There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it’s positive. Monica’s pregnant.  So I guess she won’t be totally alone.
Oh my God!|I know! Monica’s gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.|Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I’m still holding this.
Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.|Right.
Okay?|Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
No. Why?|Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
Anything?|No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn’t heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler’s parents again!
All right, we’ve got to tell her he’s gone.|No! Hey! Hey! We can’t!
Ross, she’s gonna start getting ready soon!|Well, can’t you at least stall her a little? I’ll-I’ll go back to some of the places I went last night.
All right, well how much time do you need?|Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
One hour.|Give me two.
Then why do you ask?!|Okay, wish me luck.
All right, I’ll see you guys later.|Okay. Wait, do you know how you’re going to stall her?
I’ll figure something out.|All right. Good luck.
Thanks.|Hey! Okay, so I thought we’d start with my make up and then do my hair.
Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.|About what?
Umm… I’m never gonna getting married!|Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
No Monica! I’m serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.|Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.|Rachel! You okay?
Excuse me, Aaron?  Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn’t supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It’s my best friend’s, and I’m officiating so I really can’t work past four.|Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can’t stop filming just for you. It’s not like it’s your wedding.
I’m having surgery!|What?!
Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn’t want you to worry about me. But, I’m having surgery today.|What kind of surgery?!
Transplant.|But you’re supposed to work on Monday.
Hair transplant.|But you’re not bald.
It’s not on my head.|Look Joey, there’s nothing I can do. Besides, you’re probably gonna be out by four anyway. We’ve just got one short scene. It’s just you and Richard, and God knows he’s a pro. You’ll be fine.  Morning Richard.
Hey! You’re here! Great! Great! Great! Let’s get going buddy, we’ve got a scene to shoot!|I’m wearing two belts.
Are you drunk?|No!
Yes you are!|All right.
We are never gonna find him! He’s one guy in a huge city!|Oh my God! Is that him?
That is an old, Chinese woman!|He could be in disguise, y’know.
So this is your office?|How did you guys find me? I knew I should’ve hid at the gym!
She’s fine. She doesn’t know you’re gone. And she doesn’t have to know, okay? Now come on, we’re going home.|No! No! No! I can’t do that!
What’s wrong with being the Bings?|The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?|No.
Then you are neither of your parents!|It’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don’t race cars! I don’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
Y’know, okay. You’re right. It is huge. So why don’t we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?|Well yeah, but then…
Yeah—No-but-but-but-but! We’re just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that’s not scary right?|Depends on what you mean by we.
The nights are the hardest.  But then the day comes! And that’s every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again…|The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I’m sorry! I have to start getting ready! I’m getting married today!
I know. At dusk. That’s such a hard time for me.|
Okay. But wait!|What?!
Let’s go to lunch.|I can’t go to lunch!!
Oh good God! I’ve fallen down!|What’s going on?
Okay. All right.  Honey listen. When I tell you what I’m about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.|Okay, you’re-you’re really freaking me out.
We can’t find Chandler…—‘s vest. We can’t find Chandler’s vest.|How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
Oh!|Oh wow! Okay. Don’t scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!|That can be arranged.
What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!|Let’s take it from there.
Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I’m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?|Of course! I’m-I’m sorry. I-I’d hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
Thank you. Thank you.|Still rolling, annnnd action!
I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!|Now, that can be arranged!  Slippery little bugger!
So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?|Here comes the bride.
Oh my God Monica!|I wanna wear this everyday.
There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn’t so scary, was it?|No.
I’m telling you, just a little bit at a time.|Yeah okay. Well, what’s the next little bit?
Getting married.  Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you’ve done everything else!|Yeah. You’re right. Hey I-I can do that.
Yeah.|Okay, excuse me for a minute.
Wh—Hey—Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!|Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
Okay.|Okay.
Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It’s a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?|I don’t know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
Hi!  Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?|I thought he was with you.
He-he was with me umm, we’re playing a little game, y’know? Hide and seek.|You can’t ask us son, that’s cheating.
You’re right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.|Well, he better not come by here. He can’t see the bride in the wedding dress.
Oh my God! Monica!|I know! Hey, how’s Chandler doin’?
Great. He’s doing great. Don’t you worry about Chandler.|Are you okay?
Uh-huh.|Well, you’re-you’re sweating.
These-these are beads of joy.|Oh that’s sweet. Don’t touch me.
Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?|Yeah!
Chandler’s gone again!|Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy’s hammered!|I’m sorry Joey, as long as he’s here and he’s conscious we’re still shooting.
So I uh, I just talked to the director. That’s it, we’re done for the day.|Well have we finished the scene?
Yeah! You…you were wonderful.|As were you.
So I got your car, it’s right outside.|Why? Are we done for the day?
That’s what you told me.|Oh, thank you. You’re welcome.
No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.|Is that my ass?
There he is!!|What?
You’re not getting away this time mister! Unless you want that ass kicking we talked about!|Ross!
Hiiii-Ya!!  I’m serious! You’re not walking out on my sister!|That’s right! I’m not!
Then where the hell have you been?!|I know about Monica.
What?|Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking.
What?! What?! Talking about what?!|You don’t know?
Know what—If somebody doesn’t tell me what’s going on right now…|What? You’ll hi-ya?
Oh my God. Oh my God! And you’re-you’re…you’re not freaking out?|Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes…
Dude.|Way to go son! I knew you’d find him!
Our little boy is getting married.|Oh look at you! So handsome!
Oh and they’re gonna have a baby.|Uh-huh.
The Stuff You’ve Never Seen|Conan O’Brien
It’s a tradition here on Friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys,  talk down the episode umm… The point of this whole thing is what people see in America is: they see Friends, they love the show, it looks like a smooth running machine, but behind the scenes there’s deceit, mistrust, and hate. And I thought, I thought we’d actually take a look at uh, y’know some of these moments where you guys are—there are mistakes. You make mistakes.|Once and a while.
For example, I don’t have to memorize lines. You guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?|Our energy just comes way up when there’s an audience here and when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesn’t, it just doesn’t work.
Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn’t. I did.|Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh.
Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I don’t know what to do!|It is one of those days!
‘Xcusa seniora, voulez-bere quakay—[Beep]—uck it!|Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?
You still get nervous everybody just before a show?|Absolutely.
Action!|When you were little you slept through-through the Grand Canyon.
Watch again that hand.|This’ll be five/ten takes.
Okay.|Okay. You know it’s gonna happen.
Once again, and action!|
Sorry, let’s go back! ‘Cause you’ve got more to say.|Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that’s your fault. I…say.
Hey and, this is a little extra something for y’know, always being there for me.|Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!
Ahh! Sh——it that hurt!|Are you okay?
It was so wild! We told ‘em we were the Gunderson’s in 16…|I spit on her!
Operation. You had a fun one.|Oh yeah!
With Operation.|It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer.
But le Blanc really doesn’t mess up much.|You don’t verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up.
He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And he——he was afraid he was gonna fall down…|You could actually see him trying not to fall down.
Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out!|Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!
Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something’s naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?|I don’t necessarily like to juice things…
Oh! Ooh-ooh!|What are you doing?!
You’re still a tiny bit on fire there.|Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!
It was great seeing you the other night.|Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.|What the fu——ck are you doing?!
Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with a monkey…|That damn monkey.
Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That’s Dr. Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There—|Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here—Katie!  Very good.
No y’know, I don’t want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!|Well at Monica’s you can eat—
Ready?|Yeah.
And then it just builds on itself and there’s no doing the scene after. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it.|For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when—I mean when…
You bastard.|Yeah, what did I do?
Mornin’|Mornin’
I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can’t even say, "Hmm, noodle soup?"|That’s a good one?
Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross.|No! No! No!
I’m doing my brother.|That’s…gross.
You uh, you’ve worked with—They always say a performer should never work with pets or children.|Aww, the kids.
Action.|Okay. Now—What is my first line?
The good thing about the young kids though, they’re completely unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one story…|Oh little Ben.
Hi! We’re visiting!|Yay!
It’s Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y’know, you might as well say it because I told your…|Da…Da.
Can you say Da-Da? See, I’m gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try…|Da…Da.
Huh?|Da…Da.
And then sometimes during the show y’know but you’re like, the scene’s going one way but you’re just tempted to say something another time. Like, do you remember that one where Monica’s baking cookies in our old apartment?|She’s trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.
What do I smell?|
What are you guys doing?|Nothing.
So that you will intentionally do something that—they’ll-they’ll intentionally screw it up?|Yeah!
That tastes like feet!|It tastes like  feet!
Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and you’ll—we’ll be rehearsing during the week and you just—whatever-whatever the joke is; it’s so funny we can’t get through it in rehearsal and just…|You just know.
Are you saying that you don’t want to get with this?|You see, I don’t say—
Whoa! She’s purty!|Oh yeah, and she’s really nice too! She taught me about y’know, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.
When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be; there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a scene.|Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a stair—a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably…I-I think it was the hardest I’ve-I’ve laughed in my life period.
Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!|Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
You’ve done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80 years from now you’ll be thinking about?|It is when we’re able to crack each other up.
Monica’s gotta have the phone in the right place and—|We are fixing it.
Okay Friends gang, thanks for doing it.|Well thank you so much.
Oh what are doing?!|You’re still a tiny bit on fire there!
I think you got it!|I’m sorry, I messed up.
No-no! I’ll-I’ll…|That is too much!
Great.  Great! Just give me a sec to change film.|Okay.
Now why don’t we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.|Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
Well then why don’t we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.|Okay.  Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren’t pregnant?
Why don’t we have Monica step away and we’ll get Chandler and the bridemaids.|How about just the bridemaids?
Smile ladies.|Oh!  Oh by the way?
Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!|Before we go out there I’ve got a present for ya.
So, are you ready to talk about it?|No.
Now?|No!
Okay, we’ll talk about something else then.|Thank you.
Who’s the father?!|Ugh! Look honey y’know what? I haven’t told him yet, so until I do I don’t think I should tell anybody else.
Yeah. That’s fine. That’s fair. Is it Tag?|Phoebe!!
Okay, I’m sorry. I’ll stop.|Okay.
Is it Ross? It’s Ross isn’t it—Oh my God, it’s Joey!|Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
Oh sweet Lord.|I’m sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it’s either this or a bathrobe! Look, what’s more important, the way I’m dressed or me being with you on your special day?
Hi. I’m uh, I’m Ross. I don’t, I don’t believe we’ve met. I’m Monica’s older brother.|Oh hi, I’m, I’m Mona from her restaurant.
Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant.  Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.|You think so? I’ve always kinda hated it.
Aw come on, Mona Lisa?|Uh-huh.
Mona umm…Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she’s uh—well she’s dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.|Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
Linda Clickclocken.  Oh, uh me too.|Oh good. Now there’ll be someone there who likes my name.
Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I’d like you to meet Dennis Phillips.|Congratulations.
Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.|Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.|I don’t believe we’ve met, Joey Tribbiani.
Well, it’s a funny story.|Funny: ha-ha or funny:
Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.|Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? ‘Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would’ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that’s just for ugly people.|What size shoes do you wear?
Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.|Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
Uh, I don’t even really know where I left those. Sorry.|Those aren’t eleven and a half.
Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!|Oh y’know what honey? Let’s not talk about that right now?
This is so huge.|Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
Of course not nothing is. Between me and you…|Yeah.
…in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?|Hey! Y’know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they’re supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!
How?|I don’t know! Maybe they have tools.
Well I-I talked to and uh, she’s definitely going to have this baby. Y’know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.|Well, maybe that’s, maybe that’s really brave.
Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it’s gonna be.|Maybe she hasn’t really thought it through that well.
Well, there’s a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she’s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?|I don’t know.
Are you okay?|Uh-hmm. I’m just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin…|Oh really?!
Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said…|Rachel’s really the one who’s pregnant.
Why bother?|How do you feel?
Calm down. Maybe you’re not pregnant.|What?!
When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.|Yes! Maybe it’s a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
I’m-I’m just saying, don’t freak out until you’re a hundred percent sure.|All right, I’ll-I’ll take it again when I get home.
I’ll run out and get you one.|Oh, you guys are so great.
Oh no, she won’t tell us.|Oh, come on it’s my wedding! That can be my present.
It was the chair again! Okay? I’m not doing it! It what—look, I don’t—y’know what—eh-eh…  Hi.|Hi!
Umm, would you like to dance?|Sure.
Yeah?|Yeah.
Oh great!|Dr. Geller?
I wasn’t farting!  Yes?|Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?
Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, I’m about to dance with this lady.|Okay.
Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldn’t mind letting you go first.|I’d be happy to.  You are very sweet.
Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why don’t we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.|Sure!
Yeah? Hop on.  Is the pretty lady looking?|Uh-huh.
And the world will never know.|Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.|No-no! No! No! You don’t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I’m a soap actor.
But you’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.|Hey!
Thank you.|No-no, thank you Miranda.
Melinda!|All right.
Thank you.|That was very nice Ashley.
So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?|Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
Well, I’d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you’re casting for this new show…|Look umm Joey, I-I don’t think you’re quite right for this project.
Oh, see that’s where you’re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn’t see it up there, just-just try me.|It’s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
Well I’m not proud of this, but…|Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don’t-don’t-don’t!
Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?|Did it turn into sand?
Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you’ll be fine.|No. No, I won’t. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn’t want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me.  There you go.|Chandler, I’m gonna have you arrested.
How much longer?|30 seconds.
30 seconds, okay.|Rachel, I-I want you to know that, if it’s positive, we’re gonna…
Oh I know. I know.|It’s time.
Oh wait! Y’know what? I can’t, I can’t look at it. I can’t. Somebody else tell me, somebody tell me.|Okay.
Okay.|Umm, it’s negative.
What?|It’s negative.
Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew!  God.|Well… Well, great.
Thanks.  How could I be upset over something I never had? It’s negative?|No, it’s positive.
What?!|It’s-it’s not negative, it’s positive.
Are you sure?|Well yeah, I lied before.
Oh!|Oh God…
Oh-oh, that’s a risky little game!|Are you really gonna do this?
Yeah. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby. I’m gonna have a baby!|With who?
I just didn’t see the fast song coming.|Shh. Shh. Don’t try to talk, we’ll get you up to your room, we’ll soak your feet, you’ll be okay.
Oh, thank you.|That is so sweet!
Wait a minute! No! I’m the nice one! I’m the one who danced with the kids all night! How…How small are your feet?!|David Schwimmer
Listen y’know what sir? For the last time, I don’t care what the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!|Hey!
Are you joking? Check out is not ‘til noon and he has a good  eleven minutes left.|Oh.
Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y’know, he screamed out Radisson at the end.|Okay, well I’m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed.
Hi.|Hey.  Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?
Why not? It’s built into the price of the room.|Yeah but you don’t need——What is this?
Thread!|Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
What disposable cameras?|The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
No you didn’t.|Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said…
Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?"  Yeah, then you did that.|So you don’t have the cameras?!
No. Sorry man.|So? What? What? They’re gone! Monica’s gonna freak!
Well, I’m sure they’re still somewhere here in the hotel. I’ll-I’ll help you look for them.|Great.
Hey!|Hey!
Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?|No!  even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn’t mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?
A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.|A tiny salt shaker!!!
Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!|Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.
Oh yeah.|Good. Okay, I’m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.
Okay.|Whew. Although y’know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I mean… I guess y’know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?
Well I guess it’s okay to open one more if it’s part of a set. Y’know, it’s probably this one.|Or this one!
Yeah that’s right Chandler does still think I’m pregnant. He hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.  After you of course.|Don’t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, ‘cause I’m going to tell the father today.
Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?|Ew! No!
What?! I think he’s cute.|Well then you have his baby.
Believe me I’m trying.|Wow. Y’know it is so weird. I mean, you’re gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea what’s gonna happen.
Yeah. You’re just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. You’re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.|Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.
Pretty big? It’s huge! God, this guy doesn’t have a clue! He’s just walking down the street thinking, ‘I had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!’ then bam! He’s a father and everything’s different.|Well it’s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I’m not gonna ask him for anything.
Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he’s walking around thinking, ‘Do I want to be a dad?’ and then bam!|What was that bam?
I don’t. He got…he-he-he-he’s hit by a bus.|Hey!
Oh yeah. That’s me.|Oh my God Pheebs! You’re gonna have a baby?
Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I’m gonna have a baby!|Whoa, wait a minute. Who’s the father?
You don’t know him. It’s not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby.|Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? ‘Cause I will track him down and kick his ass!
David Lynn.|David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!!
Chandler?|Hey! Did you find the cameras?
No. Did you?|Yes! And that’s why I’m under the table. Celebrating.
Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-one’s turned them.|Well this is great. Y’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she’s really depressed.
Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?|All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can’t believe I screwed this up!
I’m sorry man.  Here’s a thought. This is the same ballroom. There’s a band. There’s gonna be plenty of dressed up people.|Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
No-no-no, I’m saying we-we buy more of this  at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody else’s faces.|Are you serious?
I’m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?|Marriage advice? Really?!
I’m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren’t these the same flowers?|I don’t know, Monica picked out the flowers.
What about the chairs?|She picked those out too.
How about the place settings?|That was her.
What did you do?|I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?|Not yet.
Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it?  Is it Gunther?|No! Phoebe, it’s not Gunther.
Thank God, ‘cause that hair on a baby…|Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven’t told him yet and I don’t think I can tell him at all now!
Why not?|I don’t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, ‘I’m gonna tell the father today’ and then bam!
Bus?|No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!
Well-well but it is huge.|I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didn’t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.
Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?|No! No! I shouldn’t have even opened these! I mean I—Joey I am out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?
Okay.|Give me one more.
Oh good, uh you’re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got something I want to say.|All right.
Umm, now uh… It’s a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Y’know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so…  Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?|Oh my God! Joey!
Why?! Why can’t she marry me?!|I can and I will!
Oh my God.|Hey!
Who’s the father?|We don’t know.
Ohh… I wonder if that dude.|There’s a dude?
Yeah.|Who? Who is it?
About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn’t see who it was but…|Was that story over?
The guy left this.|
Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?|Oh! Of course.
Uhh… Yeah sure.  Click!|It didn’t click.
Oh yeah. I’ll take, I’ll take your picture.|Uh, your finger was covering the lens.
Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!|What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?
I may play the fool at times, but I’m a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that won’t quit.  I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.|Oh God… Oh, he’s in there right now?
Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?|Uh, let’s rip!
Really? Are you sure?|Oh Phoebe!
Okay, sorry. Yeah.|Hey Rach.
Why don’t you go up on stage. I’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.|Okay. Okay!
Okay, you ready for the last picture?|Yeah.
So, what’s this about?|Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.
No.  This is my red sweater.|Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or…poison? No? Just for me? Okay.
What’s going on Rach?|Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y’know you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?
Y’know, I’m actually glad Phoebe called.  I know we broke up because you thought I wasn’t mature enough, but I’ve really grown up and think we should get back together.|Oh, it’s just not the right time.
It is the right time.|Okay.
I’m ready for more.|Tag…
Come on Rach, let’s give it another try.|I’m having a baby.
Oh.|You can go.
I don’t know how any of these got opened?!|You opened them all?
I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!|Oh hey! You got my parent’s gift!
Yeah. What is that?|Well, I don’t know. I think it does something to salami.
Hey! How’d it go?|Yeah. What-what did Tag say?
So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?|No, I will. I’m just not up for it tonight.
What?!|What?!!
Great! We’re hangin’ in the kitchen!  Let’s stay in the kitchen!|It’s picture time.
Wow! That is a great picture!|Eh?
Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!|Huh, didn’t see that coming.
That would be a good idea.|Okay.  You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!
You kissed another woman!|Call it even?!
Okay!|Well, I’m gonna go get these  in some water.
Hey! How you doing?|Good! Good, long time no see.
Yeah.|Like your sweater.
Oh hey, right back at ya.|Oh, it’s crazy about Rachel huh?
Yeah. She—Well, she’s one crazy lady?|So whose is it?
Umm, I don’t some Italian guy. Come on, read your own label. See you later.|Okay.
Hey! Babe! Aren’t you excited we’re going on our honeymoon?|Yeah I am!
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama…|That’s right. Get it out of your system while we’re alone.
I’d better go pack.|Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn’t find though was your Speedo.
A Speedo? Uh, I don’t have a Speedo. I’m gonna go pack my regular long bathing suit.|Oh good you’re still here!
Hey, what was that all about?|Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are gonna have a baby.
Why am I talking like this?!|I didn’t think you could keep it a secret.
I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.|What secrets?
Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.|You’ll tell me later?
Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.|Y’know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a baby. Maybe you and I should do something.
All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.|I don’t have a key, they took mine to give to you.
What?! They took mine to give to you!|Why would they take away our keys?
Maybe they don’t trust us.|No that’s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.
You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monica’s guest towels?|Hey, I washed those!
No you didn’t.|Yeah that didn’t sound like me.
Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!|Yeah, I have stuff in there too.
What stuff?|Monica’s chicken parm! I’ll take care of it.
Did Rachel find you?|No why?
Oh she was looking for you.|Oh well, I guess I’ll catch up with her later.
Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.|Yeah, it seemed pretty important.
What?|I think I might know what this is about.
And?|Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.
Oh sorry.  And?!|Well, we-we said we’d just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.
Maybe it’s something you ate?|Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.
Next?|They’re kissing let’s just go around them.
Oh, let me see what I can do.  There are some first class seats available.|Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let’s act like we’re on our honeymoon.
Next?|Hi, sorry. I almost didn’t hear you, because y’know I’m just so in love with my new husband. We’re on our honeymoon.
Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you’ll be in 25J and Mrs. Bing you’ll be in 25K.|Oh no, you see we’re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your little thing and bump us up to first class?
I’m sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple got the last two.|You see, if we’d gone around them like I said, we—She would’ve given us those tickets. Damnit!
I still can’t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.|Of course I do! And I’m gonna give it back to you as soon as they’re done with it at the key shining place.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?|You said there was a gas leak in here.
Look at that! Look at that! They’re going into the first class lounge! Do you know what they have in there?|No.
Me neither! We have to get in!|Just act like you belong.
Oh my God! Oranges!|Shh!
Hi!|Hi.
Hi.  Umm, I think there’s something that we really need to talk about.|Look uh, I know why you’re here.
You do?|Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first.
Okay.|Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That’s been one heck of a see-saw hasn’t it?
What?|I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and…and certainly passionate, but don’t you think it’s better if we just stayed friends?
Seriously. What?!|Okay. Okay. Y’know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean I’d-I’d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.
Okay, y’know what? Can I, can I talk now?|Oh sure.
Can I get you some water?|I’m good. I’m good.
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as you want.|Yeah, I need uh… I’m just—I don’t know—I don’t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.
I know. I know, but y’know condoms only work like 97% of the time.|What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!
They do!|No they don’t!!!  Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!
Okay Ross come on let’s just forget about the condoms.|Oh well I may as well have!
Listen, y’know what? I was really freaked out too when I found out…|Freaked out? Hey no, I’m not freaked out! I’m indignant! As a consumer!
Y’know what? Let’s, let’s talk later.|No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I—In fact,  I am going to talk to the president of the condom company!
Okay, y’know maybe I should come back…|Shh! Shh! Shh!
Okay.|
I’ve looked everywhere. There’s no gas leak.|
Anyway uh, I’ll get moving on that new door.|Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? ‘Cause y’know umm, they don’t-they don’t have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.
Well I’m gonna have to put on a new lock, they’ll find out anyway.|Oh no.
Hey Ross!|Hi.
Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?|Sure.
Namaste.|Namaste.
I can’t believe we’re here.|Oh you’ve got to be kidding me.
What?|As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.
No!! You have been screwing us all day!|Who are you?
Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you’re not the only ones on your honeymoon!|Well you can have the suite if you want. We don’t care about where we stay. We’re here to celebrate our love together. We don’t have to get free stuff. We just want to be together.
Hey Monica it’s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin’ from your apartment.|What? Are you serious?!  Joey smells gas!
Yeah and we’d go check it out, but you took away our keys.|Well do something! Get in there!
How? I guess I could break down your door.|Yeah! Do that!
And-and you won’t blame us for any damage?|No!  Are you doing it?! I don’t hear anything! Come on!
Uh, okay I’ll-I’ll-I’ll break it down.|Oh hey hi, he’s doing it. He’s breaking down the door.
Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?|If I said I was, would you judge me?
The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.|Okay.  Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery Barn…
Hi.|Hey!
Oh, everything went great.|Good.
Oh no, I know I couldn’t see it either at first, but it’s right umm…  Ross, I lost it again.|Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I can’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.|You’re really sticking with the shell necklace huh?
They’re terrific, and they live right here in the city.|Yeah, can we go call them? Is it too soon to call? I wanna call.
I’m sorry, we’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with.|I know.
Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance…|Y’know what? Why don’t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?
We really…didn’t get a chance to…|You have got to be kidding me!
Hi!|Hey!
Welcome home.|So, how was the honeymoon?
Oh! Look! I have a sonogram picture!|Oh great!
Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there ‘cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.|You’re welcome buddy.
And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.|Umm that’s…that’s a little misleading.
What is?|The lie you just told.
That-that you came on to me?|There’s the one!
But you did! I mean, let’s be honest.|Yes let’s. Y’know what? Uh, it’s-it’s not important. What is important is that, is that we’re having a baby. And it’s not—Doesn’t matter who came on to who.
You know you kissed me first.|What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!
I was sending you signals?|Yeah!
Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands.|Y’know what?! It doesn’t matter! It doesn’t matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!
Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, ‘cause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?|Y’know what? Y’know what? Rachel, just-just drop it.
No please, show me how I begged you!|I can show you, I have it on videotape!  It’s an expression.
I can’t believe he taped the two of them having sex!|Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake.
Greg and Jenny?|Do you still wanna call ‘em? I wanna call ‘em.
You got fake numbered.|What?! People don’t do that!
Excuse me, I don’t want Greg and Jenny’s rejects.|Rachel won’t talk to me! She won’t even open the door!
Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!|Okay, listen I am not a pervert!
That’s like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!|Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, here’s what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.
Hey!|Hey.
Do you have a minute? I’d like to talk to you about something I’m, I’m really uncomfortable talking about.|Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?
I actually had a topic in mind! I’m, I’m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.|Whoa, for like months?
Five to be lying, six.|Six months? Whoa that’s rough.
Well, I mean it’s not all bad. I’m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.|The sky’s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!
Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay—I’m scared for my health!|Okay. Okay. Umm…Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It’s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they’re like putty.
Really? Well then tell it to me.|Okay. Now you’re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.
I’ll try to control myself.|Okay.  Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe…
You were backpacking across Western Europe?|Have a nice six more months Ross!
Okay! Okay! Okay. I’m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?|I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around.  And across the lake I saw…a beautiful woman…bathing herself…but she was crying…
Umm, this is great wine.|It’s from France…In Europe…Western Europe. Y’know umm, a few years ago I actually was backpacking across Western Europe.
Really?|Uh-hmm—Wait! It gets better. Um, yeah I was in Barcelona.
I studied for a year in Barcelona.|Anyway, umm so I was um, I was hiking…
I love hiking!|Oh that’s great! I was hiking along the foothills of Mount Tibidaybo…
I think its Tibidabo.|Okay! Do you wanna tell the story?!
Whoa! What are you doing here? How did your date go?|Great! I’m across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!
Hey! Look, if it didn’t work it’s because you didn’t tell it right! Show me how you did it.|No! No, I don’t…don’t want to.
How long since you’ve seen a girl naked?|I was backpacking across Western Europe.
I’m not feeling it.|I was just outside Barcelona, hiking…
No! No! No Ross! I’m not hot! Are you hot?|It’s been six months! I’m always hot!
Well you’re not selling the story! It’s like; it’s like you don’t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I’m preparing for an audition. Okay? I’ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you’re doing wrong.|I’ll try that.
All right now… All right, you’re all set up. You’re good to go. Just hit record. All right?|Thanks.
Good luck.|Thanks. And-and hey Joe?
Yeah?|Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I’ll help you out.
|Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?  Rachel!
Y’know what? This is not fair to her. Let’s just forget the tape!|Thank you.  No!
You’re right.|Joey! No!
I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.|Y’know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn’t give you real names either.
Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don’t give out fake names.|Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.
I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.|I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
|Well maybe it was all of your questions.
What about my questions?|The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!
Oh, I’m sorry. Was that another joke?|Was that another question?
Hell yeah!!!|I am not gonna show you this!
There I am.|You’re gonna get pregnant.
I screwed up so bad, I told Monica that I would stuff and send all these wedding invitations like weeks ago and I-I…|You didn’t do it?
I-I know—I had put them in…in-in my desk at work and I completely forgot about them until today.|Sweetie okay. It’s okay. Everybody made it to the wedding. I’m fine.
Kinda hurtin’ my hand though.|I know.
Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh…oh-oh-oh…|Did you do it on our invitations?!
Can you believe this is already happening? I mean it seems like yesterday they just got engaged.|I know. Hey remember…remember the night they got engaged? How uh, you and I almost…
Oh, I remember how we almost. Do you think we would’ve gone through with it? Y’know, if we hadn’t gotten caught. Do you think we would’ve done it?|I mean I…I know I wanted to. I just, I just wasn’t sure if you wanted to.
Oh I wanted to.|So we…we both wanted to.
Interesting.|Anyway umm, it probably worked out for the best.
Okay, in about ten seconds you’re gonna see him kiss me.|And in about five seconds you’re gonna see why.
Okay, get ready to see some beggin’!|Oh, you came on to Ross!
What?!|Now I’m so happy.
What are you talking about?!|You used the Europe story!
How do you know about that story?!|How do you know about that story?!
I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!|
No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams.|Ken Adams!!
Hi.|So uh, apparently people are familiar with the Europe story?
Yeah. Listen about that, the whole uh, who came on to who thing really doesn’t matter. I mean, I think it would’ve happened either way. I mean if you hadn’t initiated it I-I-I know I would’ve.|It was an amazing night.
It was. It was an amazing night.|You think it looked amazing?
I uh… I don’t know. I mean I…I honestly didn’t watch it.|Yeah, me neither. Yet…
Uhhhhhh…that-that may be weird.|Yeah, it would be really weird.
Good luck.|Good luck to you.
Mind if I mute?|Oh please.
Oh, oh there go the clothes.|You are undressing very quickly.
Six months Rachel, six months.|Ah.  Oh.
Hey. We-we look…we look pretty good.|That’s what I was gonna say.
Oh nice tan!|Thank you! I had just gone to the beach that weekend.
Ah….|Have you been working out?
I have been working out.|Really? Wow, this is so much better than I…
Oh that’s not pretty.|Oh! Oh!
No!|Oh God!
Oh no!|Oh, make it stop!
Oh no!!|Make it stop!!
No!!|Have to make it stop!!
That is their old number! Jenny’s been giving it out since they moved!|Jenny! That is so Jenny!
Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go!  Hey Phoebe!|Hey!
Hey how was dinner?!|Dinner was good!
Okay!|I’m just saying hi! Now I’m gonna go!
Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.|Oh, so you're Monica’s boss?
Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?|Yeah.
All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.|I like your necklace.
Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.|You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
You’re a joker Bing.|What’s funny about that?
Drake, I’ve discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.|What is it?
Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica’s brain.|Is it serious?
Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.|Well that sounds simple enough, let’s just do that.
We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica’s body, it was gone.|Cut! Very nice people!
Hey good scene man.|Hey you too!
Alright.|What? You weren’t in it.
Ooh Monica!|Hi!
Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can’t wait to get sous-neath him.|I…I have to fire him.
But why?!|Because he’s terrible! Okay, he’s slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
Well maybe he was just nervous, y’know you can be very intimidating. And besides I’ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.|Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?|All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
That’s fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.|I paid to have this done.
Hey!|Hi!
Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.|I thought I was a complete idiot.
Hey, I’m with you. He even asked me if I thought you’d go out with him.|Oh! Oh, I think I’m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
I said no.|What?!
What? I…I just figured since you’re pregnant you’re not gonna be seeing people.|Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
I didn’t tell him. I didn’t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.|Good-good, don’t tell him. Don’t tell him. Just have him call me okay?
Rach look, I really don’t think that’s such a great…|Okay, you go do it! I’ll come back to that set! I’ll meet more actors! I’ll meet ‘em all!
Hey Bob.|Hey! How’s my pal Toby doing today?
If I see him, I’ll ask.|Toby!
Yeah!|Oh then you know each other.
We’re on a semi-first name basis.|What do you think of adding him to our team?
Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don’t know if he has what it takes.|Really? They love him down on six.
But this is eleven. It’s almost twice as hard up here.|Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
I think it’s best sir.|But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I’ve got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
Y’know what you should do, just toss ‘em in the shedder and claim you never got ‘em.|
Hey!|Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
But…|No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
Okay. Okay, but you can’t fire him today.|Why not?!
Because I’m dumping him today.|What?! You said he was sweet!
He is sweet. He’s too sweet. He calls me all the time.  "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"|Just don’t pick up your phone.
Then he comes over!  "I’m so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!|What? So now I’m not allowed to fire him?
You can’t fire him and dump him the same day, he’ll kill himself.|Okay well then, I’ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I’ll kill myself!|Okay well, then we’ll both do it today and he’ll just have to deal with it!
Okay. But the question is who’s gonna go first. ‘Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.|What do you mean?
Come on! The boss that fires a guy that’s just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that’s just been fired, blond bitch!|I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
Hey Toby, you got a sec?|Sure, what’s up?
Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I’m not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’m a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I’m still a little drunk?"|Hey!
Hi!|Hey!
Oh no, I can’t. I got a date.|A date?
Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?|Why no, it’s the opposite of weird. It’s-it’s uh, regular. It’s-it’s uh, it’s mundane. It’s actually uh, a little dull.
Yeah—Ooh! Earrings!|A date?! She’s-she’s got a date?! With who?
Hey guys do you think this is too slutty—Hi Kash!|Hey Rachel! You ready to go?
Yeah! All right, I’ll see you guys later.|Okay. Have a great time you guys.
Thank you.|Thank you.
|Hi.
Oh, I’m so glad you called. I feel like it’s always me calling you. So, what’s up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?|It will be…in a minute. Listen, Tim you’re a really great guy.
It’s because I’m with you.|Aw.  I’m just—I’m in a place in my life right now where I…I…
Whoops. Sorry.|Oh-oh no she doesn’t! I know what that is. You can stay.
So what movie do you want to see—And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.|Books?
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it’s like enough!|Well, I tell you what. Why don’t we uh, why don’t we just stay here? Let’s not see a movie, we’ll just hang.
And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?|Hey, if that’s what you want to do I’m not gonna say no.
Dude! What is going on?!|I just…I have to find out how it went.
Why?|This guy could be my baby’s stepfather!
They go on one date and you’re worried about them getting married?! He’s not you!|I just—I-I can’t believe she’s-she’s dating?!
Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?|I don’t know! I guess I just can’t believe any of this is happening.
What do you mean?|It’s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan’s, it’s like—It breaks my heart a little. I mean I’ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y’know? Maybe fight over the science section.
That’s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!|No! No I can’t. I mean Rachel’s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?|It used to be. Now she doesn’t really have a face. Smokin’ body though.
Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn’t Rachel.|No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
I know, but I don’t think that’s what she wants.|No, it’s not what I want either. I mean I-I can’t force myself to fall in love with her again now.
That’s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It’s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there’s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?|Yeah.
Hey, I tell you what. Let’s you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!|We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
Hey Toby!|Hey Bobby.
It’s Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing’s office is?|Uhh yeah. Yeah, it’s  Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.|Okay Bob listen uhh, I’m the reason you didn’t get the job up here.
Toby don’t.|Bob!
Toby! I’m not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!|Well that puts me in a difficult position.
Hey.|I got your page, is everything okay?
Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?|Oh it’s great! It’s great! Thank you so much for introducing us!
Oh my pleasure. Okay, I’m afraid I’ve got some bad news.  Phoebe!|Monica!
You’re fired!|I’m breaking up with you!
You’re fired.|Why?
Yeah and-and I’m sorry too. But, well I just—I like things done a certain way and the chemistry’s just not right.|Oh that’s good, the chemistry thing for us too.
Tim wait!|Yeah?
Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there’s a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.|Really?
Yeah.|Thank you so much! ‘Cause I-I know I can do better!
Okay.|And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
Hello.|Hi!
Well, how was the date?|Well I’m alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
Uh-huh. What happened?|I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
Ah, he didn’t uh, take it so well?|Well better than you, but y’know still not what you want.
Oh?|He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
He sounds swell.|Doesn’t he?
Hey, wanna…wanna a little cheering up?|Yes.
Sit down.|Okay.
Guess whose middle name is Muriel.|Chandler M. Bing?
Yeah-ha!|Oh my God.
I’m sorry about your date.|Oh it’s all right. I’m guess I’m just done with the whole dating thing. It’s one more thing in my life that’s suddenly completely different. This is hard.
Yeah I know.  On the other hand in um, in about seven months you’re gonna have something that you’re gonna love more than any guy you’ve ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.|Thanks sweetie.
You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?|Oh no, I think I’m gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
Hey, I thought I cheered you up.|Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
Right. Good night.|Good night.
Ross?|Yeah?
Hey it’s Mona! From the wedding.|Oh hi!
Hi!|Wow! Uh…how are you?
I’m good except umm, you still owe me a dance.|Oh that’s right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
Oh you’re serious. Sure!|Great! Well umm…
I think I might need one more cup of coffee.|Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
What the hell are you doing?!|I just found out this is Chandler’s office! Come on Toby, give me a hand!
Hey you guys?|What?
I know it’s last minute, but we decided to have a Halloween party.|Oh good!
And everybody has to wear costumes.  Come on! It’ll be fun!|Well, I’ll-I’ll be there. I mean I have to wear a costume to all my classes that day anyway so…
You have to!|No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you’re not…
So Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?|Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.
Ursula!  Wait! Err-err, it’s me! Phoebe!|Oh, I thought there was a mirror there. Okay, bye-bye.
Wait a second! So, what’s new with you?|Umm, nothing. I mean, I’m getting married next week.
What?!|Yeah! Yeah, it’s gonna be a small ceremony. Just family.  His.
Huh. Okay. Well, I’m really happy for you.|Wait! If umm, if you want to come, I guess that’d be okay.
Really?|Sure! Why not? You could be my sister for the day.
Yeah. Okay. Umm, y’know, my friends are having a Halloween party tonight at my old apartment so, you could come. Maybe I could meet the guy you’re marrying.|Huh. Well, I’m supposed to be working at the restaurant tonight. I’m supposed to be working right now, so who cares.
By the way, it’s a costume party.|Oh! Okay, so that’s why you’re…
Hi!|Wait! You’re supposed to wear a costume!
I am! I am a woman who spent a lot of money on a dress and she wants to wear it, because soon she won’t be able to fit into it.|Oh.
Ahh!|I’m Catwoman, who wants to borrow the dress when you’re too big for it.
Okay.|Trick or treat!
Oh! Oh! Can I give out the candy? I really want to be with the kids right now. Y’know, ever since I got pregnant I-I have the strongest maternal instincts.|Trick or treat!!
|Thank you.
And you are a very funny clown.|Thank you.
And you are so in style right now. Y’know, I work at Ralph Lauren and the whole fall line has got this like equestrian theme going on. I don’t suppose you saw the cover of British Vogue, but…|Can I just have the candy?
Yeah. Sure.|Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.
Oh, you did this to him?|What?! I thought he’d love it! His favorite kid's book was the Velveteen Rabbit!
Oh!  Well you’re just the prettiest ballerina I’ve ever seen.|Thank you.
Oh wow! That deserves another piece of candy.|Thank you.
Well, I have to say that earns tutu pieces of candy.|I love you!
Ohh… Oh, honey here. Take it all.  Monica! We need more candy?|What?! There’s only been like four kids.
Yeah I know, but one of them just said that she loved me so I just gave her everything.|No wonder your pregnant.
Hey.|What are you supposed to be?
Hey Joey?|Yeah.
You read comic books right?|Exclusively.
Who do you think would win in a fight, Catwoman or Supergirl?|Catwoman, hands down.
Yeah…|But between you and Phoebe, I’d have to give the edge to Phoebe.
What?! Really?!|Are you kiddin’? Phoebe lived on the street. Okay? Plus, she’s got this crazy temper. She—She’s not standing right behind me is she?
No you’re fine.  All right well, do you think I could take Rachel?|I’m not sure.
What?! Come on I am tough! Punch me right here!  As hard as you can!|Will you relax?! What are you taking this so seriously for? It doesn’t matter.
Oh really? Okay? Well what would you say if I told you that, y’know, Ross or Chandler could beat you up?|I would say, "Woman, please!"
Oh my God, Phoebe!|What?
You’re getting a crush on your sister’s fianc�e.|No I’m not! You are!
Okay, here’s a good one for ya. Who do think would win in a fight between Ross and Chandler.|I can’t answer that! Chandler’s my husband.
So Ross?|Yeah.
Hey beautiful.|Hello handsome.  Oh look at you two. So when did you guys meet?
Two weeks ago.|Two weeks? That’s it?
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy, and it’s not like me to do something so impulsive, but she’s just so perfect, and we have so much in common.|Oh really?
We’re both teachers.|Huh?
And we were both in the Peace Corps.|Peace Corps, really?
In fact when we were building houses in Uruguay, we were, we were just two towns apart and we never met.|Yeah. It wasn’t a town when I got there, but it was a town when I left.  Shall we get me really drunk?
Howdy doody.|That’s funny. Yeah. Y’know you’re the funniest man here in a pink bunny costume his wife made him wear.
Oh relax man, relax. You’re looking a little flushed.|Hey-hey-hey, I think we might find out the answer to our question.
What question?|Monica and I were talking about who could kick whose ass in a fight, you or Ross?
There’s no question.|So you think Ross too?
You picked Ross?!|Ross is really strong! Okay, he’s the strongest out of all three of you!  Except for Joey.
I cannot believe you didn’t pick me.|Uh, in her defense, she’s right. I am stronger. I would destroy you.
Oh really?! You think you’re stronger? Why don’t you prove it?|Oh I’ll prove it! I’ll prove it like a theorem!!
You’re going down.|Oh yeah? You’re going further down! Downtown!
Oh Gunther! You brought candy! Thank you so much for picking this up! You are so sweet.|Really?
Honey, someday you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.|Trick or treat!
Gotta go!|My friend Lewis told me you were giving out money.
Oh yeah, we were but umm, now we’ve got candy.|I’d rather have the money.
Well, that-that’s not your choice. Happy Halloween!|This isn’t fair.
Well is it fair that all you did was put on a cape and I gotta give you free stuff?|Shut up!
You shut up!|You can’t tell me to shut up!
Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!|Rach?
Now wait a minute, I’ve got one more thing I have to say to you…oh right! Shut up!|You’re a mean old woman.
Look honey, you don’t have to do this, okay? It’s the strength you have inside that means the most to me. You’re loyal, you’re honest, and you have integrity! That’s the kind of strength that I want in the man that I love!|That means nothing to me.  Come on!
Hi liar!|Hey!
Y’know the only reason he’s marrying you is because he thinks all the things you were saying about yourself were true.|Well they could be true.
But they’re not!|Yeah, it’s a fine line huh?
Why are you lying to him?|I don’t know. He said he did all this stuff and then I said I did it too and he got so excited, it was really fun.
You too. And Ursula?! It was really nice meeting you tonight!!|Oh wait-wait! What does the winner get?
Wow! They’re both really strong.|Or equally weak.
Yay! My hero!|You’re a weird lady.
Hey!|Hey! Well, I had to give the kid fifty bucks to stop crying.
That’s not so bad.|No, I also had to go to a couple houses with him as his girlfriend. Oh, I am just awful with children!
Come on! You’re good with kids. They’re just crazy on Halloween. Y’know, they’re all greedy and hopped up on sugar!|Really? You think that’s all it is?
Look, I wanted to tell I’m-I’m sorry you lost.|Listen, I’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win.
Is that a secret or a lie.|No, I let him win—Ross!
Chandler please!|Oh what’s the matter? Are you scared?
Let’s go big bunny!|Okay. 1…2…3—Go!  I’m gonna kill myself!
Hey.|Hey.
Oh my God! You cleaned!  Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!|Y’know uh, I didn’t actually do this.
Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?|No, it wasn’t you.
Well then who?|I got a maid. Yay!
I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then…|Uh honey, I know you don’t like to relinquish control…
Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!|Look, she’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
Did she really say that?|Yes, I distinctly remember ‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
Fine, I can do it.  Whew.|What’s the matter?
Who’s cell phone is that? It’s just so annoying; everywhere you go.|I think it’s coming from your bag.
Hello?|Hi, it’s Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula’s fianc�e.
Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how’d you get this number?|Oh, I have a friend who’s a cop and he got it for me.
Wow! What an incredible violation—and wonderful surprise.|Uh listen, I just—I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
Oh you did?  He did it! He did it!|Wow! What did he do?
Shhh! I’m talking.|Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who…eats lunch.
Are you asking me out? ‘Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.|Yeah uh…okay. I’m-I’m sorry. Bye.
No! Wait! I was just saying that so you’d think I was a good person. Fight for me.|Uhh, I won’t take no for an answer.
Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.|Great! But wh-wh—How do you know where I live?
I’ve got friends too. Okay, bye.|Bye.
Oh my God! I’m going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can’t make lunch.|So apparently I’m available for lunch.
Yes?|Hi. I’m Ross Geller. I live in the building.
She didn’t pass.|What?
My mother’s still alive.|Oh, thank God!
It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she’s a tough old bird.|Ahh.
Are you close with her?|Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in
You speak Dutch?|Y’know I would it’s just painful.
No, she’s hanging in there.|Hmm. Do you think—Could you tell me if she’s hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where’d you get it?|Oh well umm, I make it myself! It’s two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is…y’know what? We just met.
Okay. Uhh, I’m gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I’ll clean behind the refrigerator.|I love her.
I’ll be back in a minute.|Okay.
Hi!|Come in, I’m so glad you’re here.
Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.|Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
Oh.|Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just…I got so angry just looking at her……face.
Yeah.  Yeah.|I’m sorry. I just…when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
Maybe this is too weird.|No wait! There’s only a problem when I look at you.
No don’t tear out your eyes!!|I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
Oh, yeah try that.  So, is that better?|Not really. You…you’re blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You’re Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe…If I-if I just don’t look at you for a while.  See? It…it works. I’m not, I’m not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.|Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar?
Yeah, we’re done.|Ezel.
Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?|Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
Really?!|No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
Sweet!|All right, well finish your coffee; let’s go.
Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.|To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you’re not gonna be on TV!
No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.|Oh, you’re switching apartments?
It’s not for me, it’s for Rachel.|But Rachel has an apartment.
Yeah, but when the baby comes she’s gonna want to move.|She is?
Yeah, you didn’t expect her to live there with a baby did you?|I guess I didn’t really think about it.
Hey Gunther! You’re an ezel!|Jij hebt seks met ezels.
Nice jeans!|Oh thanks! I like your top.
Oh.  You’re not gettin’ it.|What happened?!
Oh, I fell asleep.|I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That’ll really work up your appetite for lunch.|All right.
Hello.|What’s going on?!
Hey!|Hey!
How was the game?|Oh, okay. I…I ate way too much.
Oh.|Ooh.  So umm, I was talkin’ to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.|I was kinda hoping you’d stay.
Oh but Joey, I have to go. There’s no room for a baby here.|No room? It’s a baby. It’s like this big.
Honey, it’s not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there’s a screaming baby around.|I could use a challenge! It’s getting pretty easy.
Honey, it’s so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can’t do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.|I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn’t have to change.
I know.|Y’know I blame Ross for this.
I do too a little bit.|I’m gonna miss you, you’re the hottest roommate I ever had.
Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.|Oh no, stay here we’ll keep doing this. I’ll pay you.
No, I got in trouble for that before. I’ll see you later.|Absolutely.  I love the way you kiss.
Hi!|Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
How come?|Because I put my head between her legs.
To see her pants?|They’re my pants!
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?|No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?|Fine.  She’s wearing my bra!
Oh dear God!|My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
And yet you don’t recognize that you’re crazy.|Here’s the plan! Okay? I’m going to leave you get a look at Brenda’s bra!
Here’s another plan…No!|I would do it but she thinks I’m attracted to her!
Why?|Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we’re a team! We’re in this together!
I fear a jury will see it the same way!|Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman’s breasts all the time!
You see that?|Do you see this?
All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!|Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you’ll know it’s mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there’s a very noticeable rip.
Hi. How is she?|It’s not looking good.
|That’s so sweet.  Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I’m sure it would mean a lot to her.
Oh I don’t know that it would.|Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
Hey!|Welcome back!
Hey!  Can we pick up where we left off?|I don’t know, I’m still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
Why?|Uh, the sex.
What sex?|Our sex.
We didn’t have sex.|Well if I didn’t have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like…
Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!|Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
You-you…you had sex with Ursula?!|Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and…
You didn’t notice she was wearing different clothes?!|Well I was just so excited to see you.
Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y’know what? This is too weird.|No-no it’s not! I don’t want to lose you! It’s-it’s like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you—Yeah it is too weird.
So I guess this is it.|Yeah.  Maybe it’s for the best. You smell just like her.
What are you doing?|I’m leaning. This is where I lean.
Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.|Brenda a bee!
What?|Yes! It’s flown into your blouse and you’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
I think I know what’s going on here.|You do?
Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it’s wrong. You’re married.|I totally understand.  Can I just see your bra?
Hi!|Where did you get those jeans?!
You gave them to me!|No I didn’t!
All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.|Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
What bra?|The pink one with the flowers?!
You mean the one that you’re wearing?|
What is this?|Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
You’re so sweet.|Ahhhhhhhhhhhh…. That-that-that’s really just to show where the baby would go. Y’know why don’t I hold on to him so that there’s no confusion?
But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it’s going to be loud.|I’m loud!
It’s gonna be up all night!|I’m up all night!
It’s gonna poop!|Hello!
What about all the women you want to bring home?|Look, if I’m bringing home a woman who can’t stand being around a baby, then maybe I don’t want to be with that woman! Or maybe we’ll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
Joey, are you sure?|Yeah! All right—Look, I know sometimes it’ll be hard, okay? But, it’ll also be really…really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
I want me to stay too.|Ohh!
Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It’s so cute!|I know! I found it on the street.
Are you serious—Really?! It’s in such good condition.|Yeah.
Wow! Whoa-whoa what’s under the covers?|I don’t know.
It’s moving.|Ew.
It’s still——It’s got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!|Ooh! Ah! Okay!
Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don’t care,  because you got the apartment. Yes!|Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I’m gonna stay here.
Ezels!!|David Schwimmer
Hey Pheebs?|Huh?
I’m having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?|Sure. Yeah, he’s kinda sexy.
Oh no, no, I’ll be there too.|Okay so, we’ll just come up with some kind of signal if it’s going well you can take off.
No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven’t told him I’m pregnant yet.|Oh. Why not?
‘Cause I know he’s gonna flip out and I hate it when he’s angry.|Oh Rachel, this is all so ‘Papa don’t preach.’
What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he’d make me eat the entire pack.|Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
Thank you.|Gosh. I’m not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.  Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
No you don’t.|Oh my God!!! Monica!! He’s the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
Well you could’ve untied it with your hands.|This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn’t allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?|Oh, I-I don’t eat meat.
It’s chicken.|Yeah, I don’t eat that either.
I’ll never understand you lesbians.  So baby, tell me…what is new with you.|Well actually umm…
’74?! I ordered the ’75! That’s a magnificent wine! The ’74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?!  Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you’re a waiter?|This is why I told the manager I wouldn’t wait on you tonight!
Oh come on! Don’t be such a baby!|In case you didn’t notice, that is a scary man.
I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.|Well… Umm, I got TiVo.
What’s TiVo?|It’s slang for pregnant.
Are you really pregnant?|Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
Who is the father? Oh no! Please don’t tell me it’s her!|No, it’s Ross. It’s Ross. You like Ross.  Oh daddy, I hope you’re okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You’re gonna—This is your first grandchild! You’re gonna be a poppy!
That’s true.|Yeah.
So when is the wedding?|Who?
The wedding! There’s going to be a wedding. Young lady, don’t you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard!  Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!|February 2nd!
So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.|Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y’know take it all in.|Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
So, I gotta get going.|Okay, I-I’ll see you tonight.
Yeah.|Okay, bye.
Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!|My God! You must be good in bed!
I’m sorry I won’t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I’m really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.|I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn’t want him to start yelling at me like I was some ’74 Latour.
It’s Lafite. The ’74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.|All right here he comes. I’m gonna do this, I’m gonna tell him, I’m gonna be strong.
So you uh, nervous about getting married?|What are you doing?
Look, look let’s pretend it’s a real bachelor party. Okay? Y’know? Before your wedding. Come on, it’ll be fun.|Okay. I can’t believe tomorrow’s the big day.
How does it feel knowing you’re never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you’re gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.|You’re right, this is more fun.
That’s her! Okay, come on!|Hi!
Uh, that-that’s-that’s me!|That’s me.
Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.|So is that a bedroom?
Why-why would she go in the bedroom?|I’m waiting.
I love your place! Where is this guy from?|Uh that’s an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
Oh wow! So, you’re more than just dinosaurs.|So much more.
Oh my God! Oh my God! I’m so sorry!|Aw forget it, it’s from Pier One.
So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!|You got Rachel pregnant?!
You did!|Yes. Yes, yes I did.  But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
Oh? Really? That’s what my daughter means to you? Nothing?|No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care—I-I love Rachel.
Oh really? That’s how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?|Hey! I offered to marry her!
Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!|Tramp?!
I can’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!|Wait! Wait! Maybe she’s a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she’s supposed to do.
Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it.  Ma’am, are you also a stripper?|Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that’s gonna cost extra. Okay, here’s the extras, handcuffs, spanking…
That is funny, maybe for my birthday she’ll murder someone.|I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
How could you have kept all of this from me?|I was going to tell you, but…
So, tonight’s the night of the big bachelor party?|Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl’s number.
No problem. So who’s the party for?|My husband.
You hired your husband a hooker?|She’s a stripper.
No, she’s a hooker.|Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
When they’re hookers.|Oh my God Stu! I-I can’t believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she’s a hooker?
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.|Why would she do that?
Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you’re really bad at y’know, sexually?|This is the worst bachelor party ever!
In a minute!|In a minute? What’s gonna happen in a minute?!
All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.|Why me?!
Hey! It’s your bachelor party.|Which is why you should do it.
I don’t want to. You do it!|You do it!
You do it!|All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?
I miss this.|I don’t think we’ve actually done this before!
No, I-I miss hanging out with you.|Well we…we still hang out.
Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y’know now it’s like…things are different.|Well y’know, things are different. I’m…I’m married now.
Oh sure—And hey, don’t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just…I miss…hanging out…just-just us, y’know?|Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we’ll make time to hang out with each other.
You got it. Come here.|Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
So your dad dropped by. He’s a pleasant man!|Oh no…
I don’t care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she’s totally freaked out!|Oh okay, I’ll fix that to. What’s her e-mail address?
Rachel!|All right, I promise. I’ll fix this. I swear. I’ll-I’ll-I’ll-I’ll talk to her.
Okay!|Okay.
Thank you!|That’s it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a break!" "No we weren’t!" What happened to you two?!
Thank you so much for coming back over.|Oh good, you’re here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
Focus.|Okay. Um…But—Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
Yeah.|I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
Trying to date this woman.|Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
Probably shouldn’t touch me.|Y’know, I-I-I just…I don’t want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
Should I leave this open for you too?|I’m not sure yet. Why didn’t you just tell me about all this?
Because what’s going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.|Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel’s father. Look I…I made a mistake, but it’s only because I really, really like you. Really!|Okay, I guess you can…close the door now.
I swear I didn’t know she was a hooker! I mean wh—Did you let her smoke in here?|Her ass print is still on your grandmother’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
Y’know what? I’m gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper|Monica! Wait!
What?|Carry on.
Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I’ll take them off.|Could you not narrate?
…just because you’re not in love with the guy you can’t…|Wow, you told your dad the truth.
|Stupid guy on my phone.
Hey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.|
You fall for it every time!|Hey!
I just want you to say it once in a while.|All right okay, just so you know, I’m not gonna make a turkey this year.
What?!|Well Phoebe doesn’t eat turkey…
Phoebe!|Turkey’s are beautiful, intelligent animals!
No they’re not! They’re ugly and stupid and delicious!|All right! Okay, it’s just Phoebe. Will’s still on a diet, Chandler doesn’t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel’s having her aversion to poultry.
She is?|Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?
Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.|Anyway, it just doesn’t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It’s a lot of work.
But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!|All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just—there’s gonna be a ton left over.
No there won’t! I promise I will finish that turkey!|All right, you’re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?
Hey, isn’t weird to think about how next year at this time they’ll be a little baby at the table?  Rachel’s! But good to know where you’re at!|Hey!
Hey!|Happy Thanksgiving!
You too!|Anything I can do to help?
Actually there is. Chandler usually helps me with this, but he’s really into the game so I don’t want to bother him. Could you help me fold these napkins?|Sure!
I’m gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.|Okay.
No! No! No! No sweetie! No! Not like that! We’re not at a barn dance. You’ve gotta—you wanna fold them like swans. Like I showed you at Christmas time, remember?|Yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.  So how’s the game?
Is your team winning hon?|Yeah! Anderson just scored again!  There’s no Anderson.
Oh, I didn’t know you liked football.|Well normally I don’t, but y’know……Green Bay is playing.
You like Green Bay?|Well it’s only like my favorite bay! {Actually, it’s not bad. It just gets a little cold in winter, but in Wisconsin winter only lasts from August to June. J }
Hey!|Hey!
Aww thanks! God Will I’m so glad that you came! You look great! You must’ve lost like…|150 pounds. Yeah, I’m gonna be in one of those Subway sandwich commercials.
A pie!|Oh right. All right, it’s no fat, it’s no sugar, it’s no dairy…it’s no good. Throw it out.
You wanna meet some people? This is uh; this is my husband Chandler. Chandler, this is Will.|Hey.
This is Phoebe.|Well done.
Wanna give me a hand?|Sure! Monica, I can’t get over how great you look! You look stunning!
Well you look incredible too! You’re just—you’re so fit!|I’m watching the game, but I’m not deaf!
Oh umm, I meant to tell you, Ross is coming.|Ross is coming. Great! I love Ross!
Good. And Rachel Green too.|Oh.
Is there a problem?|Nope. Uh, it’s okay. It’s just uh, God I hated her.
What?|Yeah, I hated her. She was horrible to me in high school. But hey, it was a long time ago, I’m in a good place, it might be actually fun to see her again. You got any cakes or cookies or something?  No Will no!
Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you’ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.|Let me explain to you how the human body works. I have to warm my stomach first. Eatin’ chips is like stretching.
All right.|Don’t worry, Tribbianis never get full.
Will! From high school.|Oh hey!
Joey.|Hello.
Hey sweetie. Oh good.|Rachel Green.
That’s Will from high school!|Oh! I do not remember him! Wow! He's really got that sexy, smoldering thing going on.
Okay, dinner’s ready!|Good game!
Oh, so who won?|Green Bay.
What?|Well the Lions technically won, but it was a moral victory for the Green Bay…Mermen.
|That’s it?! Even if nobody helps me I can eat that no problem. At least give me a challenge!
About nineteen pounds.|It’s like me when I was born.
Apparently you were umm, a little mean to him in high school.|A little mean? You made my life miserable!
Oh Will. But you-you’ve worked so hard…|Yams!!!!
Okay.|Uh Will umm, I just want to say that I’m real sorry for whatever I-I did to you in high school…
So you were in an I Hate Rachel club?|Yes he was.
So who else was in this club?|Uh actually, there-there was also that exchange student from Thailand but I-I don’t think he-he knew what it was.
So Ross, we went out for two years, and you never told me you were in an I Hate Rachel club.|You went out with her?! We had a pact!
Okay Monica, did you know about this?!|I swear I didn’t.  Hey! Is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?
Okay. So what? You guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me?|Well, we did a little more than that.
What rumor?|Oh, come on Will! Just take off your shirt and tell us!
Ross!|It was no big deal. We-we…said that the rumor was…that umm…you had both…male and female reproductive parts.
What?!|That’s right! We said your parents flipped a coin, decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.
Oh my God!|You started that?!
What?! You heard that?!|Everyone at our school heard it!
Oh no!!!! Oh my God!! This is all making so much sense to me now! This is why Adam Carter wouldn’t go out with me! This is why Billy Tratt would just stay in this region!|Actually, Billy Tratt is gay now. So-so that one’s not really our fault.
Monica, how come you never told me this?!|I thought it might be true. And I was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.
Joey stop staring! There’s nothing there! It’s not true!|I’m afraid I’m gonna need proof.
You are my Everest.|Joey, you don’t have to finish that.
Oh yes I do. Otherwise what’s next? Today I’m just a guy who can’t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I’m the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just…I just—I gotta change my pants.|Okay! Okay! Listen to what Sean McMahon wrote in my yearbook senior year, "Dear Rach, you’re such a good person." Not girl! Person!
All right where’s that turkey!|Joey! Those are my maternity pants!
Well that’s it. I’m done. Whew!|Well Joey, we’re all…we’re all very proud of you.
No just, nobody press on my stomach.|You can keep those pants by the way.
Whoa—hey—wh-wh-what do you got there? What is that? Pie?|Yeah, you want some?
Ah, just cut me a little sliver.  What?! Are you afraid you’re gonna run out?! Cut me a real piece!|Brian Buckner & Sebastian Jones
Hey! So what do you think?|New haircut?  Boots!
Yes! Now, they’re a little more than I normally spend on boots…or rent|Oh my God!
I know.|I’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
I’m sorry, they just, they just look so good! And the saleswoman was looking at me like, "Oh, these are way too expensive for you."|She had a point.
Hey.|Oh my God!  Oh Monica! Those boots are amazing!
They’re mine!|Yeah well, too bad we’re gonna have to return them.
Honey, I’m not returning them. Okay? I mean I-I know they cost a lot, but I’m going to wear them all the time. You’ll see. Besides, I love the compliments. I mean, have you ever had something so beautiful everyone wanted it?|I have you.
That’s right, I love you! And-and I’m gonna play with you all the time.|How can you let him talk to your crotch like that?
Bye.|Bye.
Yeah. Why?|Sting has a son that goes there too!
Yeah I know; he’s in Ben’s class.|You knew this and you never said anything?! With all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?!
Fine! No more dinosaur stuff! Can I talk about fossils?|Sting’s son, seven years old and there’s a picture.
What are you reading? The Kidnappers Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?|No, it’s New York magazine. It’s an article about the best schools in the city. So how well do you know Sting?
Uh, I actually haven’t even met him.|Uh-huh, yeah that’s too bad. I really want to go to his concert Friday night, but it’s totally sold out. I know! Why don’t you meet him and get tickets?! If you get two I’ll take you.
Well actually, I’m picking Ben up tomorrow, maybe he’ll be there.|There you go! Oh, you are so lucky! You might actually get to meet Sting tomorrow! That’s why you have kids!
Hey guys!|Hey-hey.
Hey.|Hi boots.
See Chandler? I’m getting a lot of use out of them already! They’re very practical. See, you can wear them with dresses, with skirts, with pants…|You can wear them with shorts on a street corner and earn the money to pay for them.
They hurt so much!|What?!
The guy who made these hates feet and wants to see them die!|Well-well you can give them to me! I haven’t felt my feet in years!
I can’t! I spent so much money on them and I told Chandler that I’d wear them all the time, I just can’t give them away!|Well then get your money back and return them!
I can’t do that either! The soles’ are already a little scuffed up and the insides are filled with my blood.|Hey!
Here she is! Future fashion superstar!|Oh Joey, I’m hardly a…
My little sister Dina!|Right! Hi Dina!
This is so exciting for her. Well, I’ll let you two fash…ists get down to business.|Okay. All right Dina, well let’s talk about the different areas of fashion that you could get involved in. Let’s see, there’s design, but you may need a whole other degree for that. Uh, there’s-there’s sales, which is great because you get to travel…
Ahhhhhhhh!|What’s wrong?
Oh nothing I’m just—just was yawning.|Oh don’t forget, my office holiday party is tonight.
Honey, we don’t really have to go to this thing tonight do we?|Now sweetie, I know you don’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has a…supple leather lining.
I-I don’t-I don’t think that I’m gonna wear the boots tonight.|Why not?
Well y’know, I’m just-I’m just worried that bosses will see them and think they pay you too much money. Or! Or your assistant will see them and-and want a raise!|Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don’t really go with it.|You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!
Fine! If you want me to wear the boots, I’ll wear the boots. In fact, I’ll go into my room right now and y’know try the outfit on.|Okay.
I-I can’t go in there. I can’t tell him!|Honey, it’s going to be okay. He’s been incredibly supportive of me, and if he gets a little upset; that’s what the meatball sub is for.
Thank you.|Okay.
Joe, mom and dad are fine…|Is that a sandwich?!
I’m pregnant.|What?!
Joe, I tried to wait until I was 25 like you did!|What?! Dina…
Bobby Corso, but he’s a real nice guy. I like him a lot. He’s real funny.|You got pregnant for funny?! Dina…if he’s funny…laugh! All right, I’ll be back in a little while! You stay here!
Why? Where are you going?|I can’t look at you right now!
Wow.|I know.
Oh, there you are Ben!|Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?
Well, I heard you’re having a problem with one of the boys in your class. And so I thought I would just come down here and sit you both down, have a little talk and make it all okay. Now umm, the boy’s name is Sting’s son.|Jack? I hate him! He’s a jerk.
Now Ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside, but they have famous fathers.|I have to go. My friend Doug is waiting for me over there.
Him you’re friends with.|Excuse me. Can, can I help you with something?
Yes! Yes you can, I’m looking for Jack’s parents.|Are you with one of the students?
Uh-huh, I’m with Ben.|Are you one of Ben’s mothers?
I am one of Ben’s mothers. I’m a lesbian. It was, it was difficult coming out to my parents.|Well hi, I’m Jenny Boone. I’m the new teacher here.
Oh.|I’ve only met your partner Carol.
Ah! Okay so that would make me Susan.|Right. Are you looking for Jack’s parents to discuss the problems he’s having with Ben?  Yeah. Because I really do think the parents should sit down and have a conversation.
Yeah! Let’s do that!! That-that sounds good. We should sit down and talk, just me, my lover Carol, and the Stings. Umm, how-how will I get in touch with them?|Oh, their number is on the contact sheet.
Y’know, that party wasn’t bad.|Yeah! I didn’t know there would be dancing. That was a fun surprise!
I don’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?|Oh no, we can’t walk!
What honey, it’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. Let’s go.|Hey! Do you think that we can get to the subway right there if we climb down through the manhole cover?
What’s going on?|I can’t walk. Okay? Okay? These boots were a huge mistake!
What?|Okay you were right! All right, I never should have bought them! They’re killing me! One toe at a time!
So I was right. This is what it feels like to be right.  It’s oddly unsettling.|How are we gonna get home? Maybe a piggy-back ride?
Hop on.|Okay. Wait, just give me a second, I need to just get my boots off first.  Ah…Ooh…Oohh…Ohh…Oh God…Ohh…Oh…Ohh…Ohhhh…
Do you ever worry that you’ll be walking and your baby will just like slip out?|What college was that Dina?
Oh my God! Bobby!|Hi Dina. Good to see you.
No!|Oh you’ll take ‘em!
No I won’t!|Hey! You don’t get a say in this!
Yes I do!|Ahhh! I heard "I do", we’re halfway there! Okay!  You!
Wow! This place is incredible!|Hi!
Hi!|I’m Trudie.
Uh-huh.|You must be Ben’s mum.
Why else would I be here?|Do sit down.
Uh-huh.|I gather Jack and Ben haven’t been getting along lately.
Yeah.|I’m told there are two sides to this story, but all I’ve heard is that Ben’s a bit of a poo-poo head.
Umm, I’m sorry. Won’t-won’t Jack’s father be joining us?|Oh I’m sorry, Jack’s father is not available.
Uh-hmm. Okay. Well then, could we reschedule? For say, Friday night perhaps at 8 o’clock?|Oh no, I know that wouldn’t work. My husband’s in concert.
Concert. Yeah. That does put us in…quite a pickle. Because you see I’m very busy before and after the concert, and he’s obviously busy during.|So, I guess you and I should talk about Jack and Ben right now.
Unless! Unless umm, okay I-I would be willing to go to the concert, umm, all the while thinking about the children of course.|Are you here for tickets?
Oh, thank you. Four would be great.|I’m not giving concert tickets to someone who’d use their son like this!
Oh good! Then you’re in luck! Ben’s not my son!|Look, I’ve just pressed a button, triggering a silent alarm. Any minute now, the police will be here!
Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go.|Oh wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Oh I’m sorry! Do you need a break?|My boots in tan! Hey! Can you get a little closer so I can see the price?
I can see it from right here. It’ll cost you one husband.|Okay, I’m sorry. I think I can walk the rest of the way now. Just-just give me my boots.
I don’t have your boots.|Well I don’t have them either. Where are they?
Well, why don’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!|Okay.  God well, we gotta go back and get them!
Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?|Okay, I’m never gonna wear them again. I just didn’t get a chance to say goodbye.
Y’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.|Okay.  All right.
Okay.|
Joey, just because they’re not getting married doesn’t mean this is going to be a disaster. Maybe they have a plan!|Oh? Oh! Okay! Okay! Let’s hear their plan! Now, what’s the future look like for Dina and Bobby?
Hey, now wait a minute! I get when you told people at first that you wanted to be an actor they laughed at you! Now come on Bobby, why don’t you tell us a little bit about your band?|Well it’s just me and my pal Rooster, the band’s name is Numb Nuts.
|Dina, if you’re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, that’s not a compliment!
Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?|No! No! No! It’s different for you. You’re so strong and together. You’re not some dumb kid who doesn’t know what she’s doing.
So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?|Maybe!  Well! Well…so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts—Oh forget it! I can’t!
Okay Bobby, why don’t we just come over here and let them have a little moment.|Come here!
You’re gonna love me so much. I got Sting tickets!!|Oh my God! I do love you! How did you do it?!
Well…let’s just say…  Rosss caaaaan!|Oo, where are the seats?
Uh, middle balcony.|Okay, now would you say that that’s more than 50 yards away from Sting, his wife, or a member of his family?
Yeah.|Then that’s not breaking the law! I’m there!
Phoebe?|Yeah?
Look at that guy by the window, wow!|He’s awfully short and I think he’s talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he’s not that good in bed.
Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it’s like every guy I see—I mean look here.  Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that’s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I’m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.|Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
Yeah.|This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
Really?! So this has happened to you?|Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y’know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa’s lap.|Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
Ah.|Yeah.
Well, y’know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I’ll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.|Yeah. Yeah, that’s what you need a good…pill.
Hey!  Hey!|Hi!
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.|Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!|I’m missin’ picture time?!
Okay. Okay, here’s a good one of us.|Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
Y’know, every year I say I’m gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?|Together? Like-like to people?
Yeah, y’know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It’ll be cute, okay?|Okay.
Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?|Uh sure, sure.
Bye guys.|Bye.
Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!|Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.|I didn’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I’m sorry.
Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!|No leg-chewing for us sir.
Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we’ve got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?|I can’t think of anything we’re doing.  Why can’t I think of anything we’re doing?
Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!|Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow!  I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
Hi!|Hey!
Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?|Huh. Wow, this is great.
Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"|Well, we-we haven’t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
How many did you want? I’m getting a hundred.|A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I’ll take a—Mona, uh…I-I’m not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
Really? Why not?|Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don’t know if we’re really quite there yet.
Oh y’know, I didn’t think of it that way. You’re right. You’re right. So, can I ask you a question?|Yeah.
Where are we?|Huh.
Y’know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?|Hmm…
I mean I love spending time with you, y’know I just—I hope we’re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don’t you think?|Let’s do the card!
What?|The card! I think we’re there!
Okay. I—But I think we should still have this conversation.|Really?! I mean, even with the card?
Hi!|Hi!
Just so you know, Dr. Long can’t be here today, she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.|Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y’know who I’m talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers…
Hi.|Oh hey! So, how did your doctor’s appointment go?
Well, let’s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.|Oh my God.
Okay, even this is turning me on!|Hey!
Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how’s it, how’s it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?|Oh yeah, yeah we’re moving forward. You’ll be getting our card!
Uh Ross? You asked me that.|Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I’m not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I’m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y’know, something that says we’re moving forward without having to talk about it.
Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock.|Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.
Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.|Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.
Oh? Why not?|It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.
What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?|Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.
So why can’t the three of us go out together?|Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.|Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this. Now here’s the plan, grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club.|Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.
Here we go. Mona umm, I think it’s time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.|Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
Aw, we-we are so…|Okay.
I mean, there’s no point in spending time with someone if-if it’s just fun. It’s gotta be, it’s gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going?  Ah! That’s-that’s the real question. And-and the answer is…is it’s going somewhere…fun. Now I-I know what you’re thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y’know, but you’re-you’re not getting any younger. No I mean—No not you, not you, you—you are getting younger. I mean—you-you look like you’re getting younger by the second—What’s your secret?|I’m sorry, so umm, so where are we?
Well, well to sum up, we’re having fun, you look young.|Okay…
But that’s not enough. So… So…here’s a key to my apartment.|Really?!
Really.|You don’t think this is too fast.
You gave her a key to your apartment?!|Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
Hey!|Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
Yeah.|Umm, he’s here to have sex with you.
What?|You’re welcome.
Phoebe no!|It’s okay, he’s a virgin.
No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!|Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?|Oh that’s all right sir, and that’s just one girl.
Bing—What’s this?!|It’s a hand. It’s a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
No, it’s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We’re gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!|Oh no-no-no!
Okay, and oh I’m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.|Hey Ross, what’s going on? You changing the lock?
No. That guy is.|I don’t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
I’m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.|What?
I love you!|Ohh!
Hi honey I’m home.|From the tequila factory?
It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!|Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
Y’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.|I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
Yes. Hi, I’d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch.  I’ll call you back.|Who was that?
It’s just the pizza place.|You hung up on the pizza place? I don’t hang up on your friends.
I’m sorry honey, I’m just having a, having a rough day.|Oh, what’s wrong?
Oh you really, you really just don’t want to hear about it.|Then why did I ask?
Okay, it’s just—and this is really embarrassing—but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I’m just finding myself…how do I put this umm, erotically charged.|Is that college talk for horny?
Yeah. So y’know, I have all of these feelings and I don’t know what to do about them, because I can’t date like a normal person, which is fine because I don’t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y’know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he’s doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so…hard…to find.  So how was your day?|Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
Well, I gotta get up early and it’s almost seven o’clock.|Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
Okay, good night!|Good night.
I didn’t ask you to do it!|You’re Rachel!
You’re Joey!|You’re my friend!
Right back at ya!|But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
And so bad. I don’t even know what you’re talking about because I didn’t ask you to do anything!|I know!
No!|All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
That’s the end of this conversation!|This conversation never happened!
Never happened! Good night!|Good night!
Hi. Listen, I’m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn’t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you’ll really enjoy.|David Schwimmer
Hey! I got you a present!!|Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!|Pheebs you didn’t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang…
It’s a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!|Oh my God!
I didn’t know where to put it so I just left it here for now.|Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
Do you really like it?|Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like—Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
Oh really? What was your first?|Well I-I really don’t remember the name of it.
Hey! Oh, I’m so glad you guys are here. I’ve been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.|Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so….|They made you head of the department!
No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes!|Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm…
No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.|Okay, I’m next.  Don’t! Don’t start another game! I said I’m next! Phoebe!
Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t hear you over all the winning.|Chandler! Phoebe’s hogging the game!
Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.|No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don’t you go home and wait for the thank you card?
Yeah! It’s not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.|Okay. Phoebe that’s it. Come on, get out—out of the chair. Get out!  Oh come…Phoebe!
Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?|No, I’m picking you up for our date. These are for you.
Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they’re my favorite. Thank you.|And, a brownie!  Well, half a brownie. Actually, it’s just bag. It’s been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin’ to feel faint so…
Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I’m going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I’m wearing underwear that goes up to about……there.|Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so…nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
Yeah, actually that’s my roommate’s.|I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
Ah yes, but he’s very protective of me so you’d better watch yourself.|Ah… Hey, so this roommate of yours…is he good looking?
Hm-mmm.|Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
Yeah, but I’m pretty sure he’s gay.|No-no-no-no, he’s not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
…which brings us back, of course, to Greely’s theory of dominance.  Okay, that-that’s all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?|Yeah, it’s the new building on Avenue A.
What?! That-that’s all the way cross town, I’m supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.|Ooh, dude. That’s not gonna happen.
Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?|There’s a side of steamed vegetables.
Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?|Y’know what? Bring her both, and I’ll have the same.
Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date—Oh, I almost forgot. I didn’t pay you the rent check.|Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We’re on a date.
Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?|No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don’t like me for— I’m sorry I couldn’t even get through that.
I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.|Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
Oh my God. And that works?!|Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
Oh, you poor little famous man.|Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you’re so beautiful…I don’t think I can.
Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!|Alright, so…so tell me one of your moves.
Alright. So where’d you grow up?|That’s your move? Boy Rach, you’re lucky you’re hot.
Come on, just answer the question!|Queens.
And so were-were you close to your parents?|Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
Why not?|I don’t know. I guess there’s just always been this distance y’know—I mean we both try to pretend it’s not there, but it is.
It’s gotta be rough.|Yeah, it is. It’s really tough. Y’know sometimes I think—Wow!! Nice move!
Huh?|"Where’d you grow up," it’s so simple!
Thank you! And now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.|Yeah.
And now you’re watching me walk away.|Yes I am! Again so simple!
Hey.|You are not going to believe what I did today!
Well it clearly wasn’t showering or shaving.|I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler.  Although I-I hope they don’t.
Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!|Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!
What is the matter with your hand?|Well I’ve been playing it for like eight hours, it’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they’re dirty words.
Chandler, why would you do that?|Because it’s awesome.
You think this is clever?|Well y’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
Hey wait a minute, this one isn’t dirty.|It is when you put it together with that one.
Ah, well if you don’t clear this off, you won’t be getting one of those from me. But Ben’s coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can’t be there.|Come on, he won’t even know what they mean.
Chandler! He’s seven; he’s not stupid.|Have you talked to him lately?
All right, look I’m just gonna unplug it.|No-no-no, if you unplug it, I’ll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work.  Chip in it or something!
Honey you-you got to beat your scores!|With the claw?!
All right fine. Fine, I’ll do it. I’ve just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.|—My hand is messed up.
I am not gonna answer that!|Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
No one! They are my friends, I wouldn’t punch any of them.|Chandler?
Yeah, but I don’t know why. Look at me, I’m having such a wonderful time!|Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
I know!|I never laughed so hard—Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.|I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.|Huh. Huh.
All right, now don’t judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I’m ripping into this swan.|Ah! Okay, well then you don’t judge me. I’m gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani’s end of the night moves?|Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
How do you do that?|Now you can’t tell anyone, but uh…I put on shiny lip balm.
Oh my God!|Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I’m telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
No, I don’t want to tell you.|Why not?
Because it’s embarrassing.|More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?!  I didn’t say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
Well, when we’re at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn’t sound like anything, but I swear it works.|Yeah. Why—Yeah, that would work for ya…
All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.|Oh.
…you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!|No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
Well, why didn’t you just take a cab?|Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it’ll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
Well you’re not gonna be able to keep doing this.|Well I have to. Okay? If I don’t, they’ll take the class away from me. And…I already put it in my family newsletter.
You what?|You’ve seen it, the Geller Yeller.
Right. Wow!|Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I’m sure I can make it this time. I just…I just can’t be afraid to get a little bit…hit by cars.
Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?|Oh yeah, I still can’t believe you haven’t seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
Relax! It’s not like it’s Citizen Kane!|Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
Yeah I know it’s really boring, but it’s like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.|Oh yeah? All right, let’s do it tonight.
Well don’t you have that big date tonight?|Oh right!
Hey Joey, can I ask you something?|Yeah.
After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?|Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
I don’t know!  I’m-I’m kinda thinking it-it was the lobster…|Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.|Yeah me too, all night.
Really?! How come we didn’t cross paths?|Yeah well that’s because uh…I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don’t want to look in my hamper.
Okay, I got that. I’ll escape over there. I’ll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It’s got—Right— Well, you’re just a little bitch, aren’t you?|—Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
They’re all Chandler.|Chandler sucks! He couldn’t have gotten this good!
But Ben is coming over tonight and he can’t see this.|Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies.  Was it just me?!
Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.|No-no! I’m fine. It’s just… Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you’ve known for a while and then suddenly…suddenly see them a different way?
You mean like from behind?|Yeah. Yeah, that…that’s exactly it. You’re right. Yeah.
Ew, y’know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!|Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I’m talking about.
Totally! Wow!  Would you excuse me for a sec?|Oh yeah, sure.  Ehhh.
Oh my God Phoebe, you’re on fire!|I know!
Don’t touch her!!|All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
Oh God! Thank God you’re home! I’m watching Cujo.|Alone?!
Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!|Hey, did you get to the part where they’re trapped in the car and Cujo’s throwin’ himself at the windshield?
No! No! Seriously, what’s wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?|Oh uh, it didn’t work out.
Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?|Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
Y’know, I never thought I’d say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies.  What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.|Oh sure, yeah, why not?
Okay.  Okay, that’s him! That’s him! That’s Cujo! That’s Cujo!|All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it’ll be okay.
Oh my God….What’s he gonna do now? I can’t watch!  Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren’t you scared?|Terrified.
All right. It’s a new day. All that stuff about Rachel, you don’t feel that now. It was crazy! You’re fine. You’re better than fine! You are, as your friend Tony would say, Grrrreat! Everything’s normal! She’s just your friend Rachel! Your friend Rachel. Your friend! Rachel.|Hi, sweetie.
Hi.|Are you, are you high?
I just had the most amazing bath.|Really? I don’t like baths.
Wait, you like them with me.|Honey, it’s not the bath I enjoy, it’s the wet, naked lady.
Oh, baths are so relaxing!|Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
How dirty do you think I am? I’m telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away.|Honey, it’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and I’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?
Hi! Oh, Ross, don’t forget, we have that doctor’s appointment tomorrow!|Right.
Yep! Happy and healthy! And cute!|And smart!
Popular.|With an aptitude for science.
Oh yeah! I’ve come up with a bunch of ideas!|Really? Me too!
Really?!|Uh huh! If it’s a girl, Phoebe, and if it’s a boy, Phoebo!
Okay! I was thinking if it’s a girl, how about Sandrine? It’s French.|Huh. That’s a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.
Okay fine, what do you have?|Well, OK, it’s for a boy. Well, I know it’s a little out there, but…Darwin.
Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.|Yeah, by Sandrine.
I’m really, really not.|How-how about you each get five vetoes?
All right.|That sounds fair.
Yeah! I don’t think you’re going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it’s a girl, Rain.|Veto.
Why?|Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.
Ross, why do you hate our child?|Fine, you go.
Okay, James.|Huh.
But only if it’s a girl.|Oh, veto. How about—Ooh, I like Ruth! What about Ruth?
Oh! I’m sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?|Veto. Stewart?
Veto. Sawyer?|Veto. Helen?
Veto.|Is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?
Hey.|Boy, do I have a surprise for you!
Sex on the balcony?|No, but someone’s really not going to get over that idea, are they?
What is it?|I drew you a bath!
Honey, I don’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?|Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it’s a boy bath!
Well, this does butch it up a bit.|I swear, if you try it, you will love it!
All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?|Absolutely.
All right, this isn’t so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I’ve got my boat.|So?
Oh my God.|I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!
I don’t think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?|Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!
Uh, no. No, we’re not.|But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it’s a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?
No, no, we want to wait, right?|Right. Right.
What? Rach! Come on, that’s terrible! They’re…uh…they’re babies. They’re-they’re all beautiful.|Third one from the left?
Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I’m talking about it.  Don’t-don’t you—Wh—Wha—Hey!!|What?!
You’re looking!|I didn’t!
I saw you!|Okay fine, I did. But I didn’t see anything, I swear.
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!|Okay, but Ross just listen to me…
No, no, no, no! Don’t tell me! I don’t want to know!|But I couldn’t even if I wanted to, because I don’t know! I swear; I didn’t see anything, and I don’t want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.
Momentary lapse. Don’t-don’t you have any self-control?|Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.
Hello?|I’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there’s something wrong.
You know what? I-I think I’ll wait out here.|I’m in the bathtub.
Oh.  What’s wrong?|I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water’s tepid. The salt didn’t dissolve and is now… lodged places. And the scents I used don’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile—Oh!
What?|The bath salts! They’re starting to effervesce! It’s different.  It’s interesting.
Okay, let’s talk about something else.|Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!
Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and…|I had the exact same conversation.
You did? What was he talking about?|I don’t know! Joey hasn’t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!
That was a long night.|All right, let’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?
Okay, he was talking about rules.|Uh-huh.
Umm, and looking at people differently.|He didn’t say anything about that to me.
What did he tell you?|He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.
Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.|But what did he mean by rules?
Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!|Because he was looking at her differently.
And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!|My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
Just a minute!  That’s Mrs. Tribbiani!|You don’t say anything.
Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?|I’m not going to let you say anything.
You just stay here!|Oh, God!
Oh, you had that?|Uh-huh.
I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.|Oh, just as well, I broke this one.
Nothing.|Okay.
I mean, I-I, I really shouldn’t say. I mean, I’m really not supposed to.|Fine.
It’s a humdinger!|Then it’s really too bad that you can’t tell me.
Somebody likes you!|Is it Chandler?
No!|Well, then tell him to stop staring!
It’s Joey!|Really?! Joey?! You don’t say.
Is it something you’d be interested in?|I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y’know on the other hand… No. No, I can’t. We’re friends. No, oh, no. I don’t want to risk what we have.
I guess that makes sense. So, you think you’re going to talk to him?|Sure, yeah. I mean, it’s Joey. I don’t want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!
Not Chandler, just Joey.|Sure.
Hey.|Hey.
You know what? I’ve been thinking about it. I’m really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.|Rach, I-I can’t tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh… Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we’re never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it’s a boy!
I didn’t see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.|I don’t think so! You’re just giving me Ruth so you’ll get to name it when it’s a boy, and that’s when you’ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
I would—Sequoia?|Veto.
Fine.|Unless…  You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I’m not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!
But Ross, you want the name Ruth!|Not like this!
Hey.|Hey. Well, what’s up?
Umm, Joey, I know.|What?
I knooow.|Whaaat?
I know about your feelings.|Oh my God. You do?
Yes, and I’m sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that’s very rare.|I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it’s Rachel for God sakes.
For God sakes, it’s Rachel!|I know. I know. And she’s not only my friend; she’s my pregnant friend! She’s my pregnant friend who’s Ross’ ex!
Yeah that’s Rachel.  Beat me over the head with it.|What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y’know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don’t like about her. You want to hear it?
Yeah.|She made me switch to light Mayo. That’s it! That’s all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!
Joey, I just think you’re getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.|You think?
Absolutely! Y’know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.|Yeah, just a crush! That’s all this is! It’s a crush! I’m Joey; I don’t get deep feelings.
That’s right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I’ve had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I’m sure you’ve had them for us.|Not really.
So, I uh… I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.|What?
That’s right. The student has become the master.|Ross, I swear, I don’t know.
Oh, come on, you know it’s a girl!|A what?!
You really didn’t know?|We’re having a girl?
No.|That’s what you just said!
Yes. I’m… I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.|I’m not! We’re having a girl! Sometimes I can’t believe it’s with you—But still! We’re having a girl!
I know! I know. You know what? I’m putting Ruth back on the table!|Oh, yes! We’ll have ourselves a little baby Ruth…
Permission to veto.|Yes, please.
Hey.|Do I smell essential oils?
Yeah, I’m going to take a bath. I’m just going to get a magazine.|Okay.
What do you think you’re doing?|L-leaving my troubles behind?
I know that you’re new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.|Oh, it’s so hard to care when you’re this relaxed.
Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you’re just a girl in a tub!|Hey!
She pulled it out of me! She’s like a conversational wizard! How’d it go?|Well, you were wrong, he doesn’t like me!
What?|Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors’ house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn’t like you? How would you feel?
I don’t think I’d care.|Really? Lee Majors is hot!
Oh my God! A friend he’s looking at differently, but it’s wrong. It’s Rachel!|You like Rachel?!
Honey, cover it up with the boat!|Hello?
All right. It’s a new day, and it’s just a crush, that’s all! Just a little crush! All that worrying I was doing, that was crazy. Crazy! Like my friend here the bird would say, "it was cuckoo!" Everything’s going to be fine. It’s just a crush.|Hi, sweetie.
It sure is nice to do this together, isn’t it?|Yeah. And what you’re doing feels so good.
I’m not touching you.|You’re not?
It’s the salts.|Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!
Hey, what’s up?|Well, I left my guitar here again.
Oh, okay. No problem.|Okay.
Okay.|Oh.
Here you go.|Okay.
Okay.|Great! Umm…
What?!|So do you want to hang out or something?
Phoebe! You kinda caught me at a bad time.|Oh are you and Chandler…
Yes! Exactly.|Okay. Do you guys want me to play for you?
|Hey Pheebs, what’s up?
Phoebe, I can explain!|You told me you hate massages!
Well umm, Alexandra has been…|Oh, it has a name?
Phoebe, don’t get upset!|Okay—Oop! Too late! I’m leaving! Come on Chandler let’s go!
Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we’re almost there! We’re almost there!|Oh Joey, I’m so happy things worked out for us that we’re having this baby together. I love you so much.
Oh, I love you too.|And I hope it’s not an inappropriate time to say this but, you’re the best sex I ever had.
That’s always appropriate!  Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!|Oh, here is your beautiful baby. Congratulations!
What? What’s going on?|Come feel this! Come feel my belly!
Aaaah…|Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!
Really?!|Yes!
Oh, y’know what? Maybe uh, you…you should come to me. I’m a not, I’m not wearing any bottoms.|Oh, okay!
Oh my, oh my God!|Aw, it’s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she’s like umm…oh…who’s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?
Mia Hamm?|Mia Hamm!
Oh that’s amazing.|Oh-oh!! One hand on the sheet Joe!
Hey babe.|Hi honey. We just got a wedding gift from Bob and Faye Bing; they don’t like us do they?
Who says you can’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?|No, it doesn’t say where it came from. Where would we return it?
How about to the street say from the balcony?|Why don’t we just find a place for it?
Okay. How about in that cabinet?|No! That’s where we keep the canned goods! Have you completely forgotten everything you learned at orientation?
How about the closet by the bathroom?|Oh, okay. Here, why don’t you let me do it?
Oh no-no-no, I will do it. Honey, you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile.  It’s locked, you have to help me. Why is it locked?|No reason. I-I keep private things in there.
Oh y’know, I’ve been living here a while and I’ve never seen what’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?|Feminine stuff.
Don’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!|Chandler, there is nothing in there that concerns you! If you love me you-you’ll let it go.
Fine.|Thank you!
Love you.|You!
Phoebe if it helps Alexandra has only been massaging Monica for like three years.|Why won’t you let me massage you?
Hey!|Hey Ross! The baby’s kicking!
What?! It is?!|It’s not kicking right now. Although we would love to see you do  that again.
Hey, when-when was it kicking? What happened?|Last night! I just felt it and I went into Joey’s room and he was sleeping…
My God, the baby’s kicking. That’s great. Although I…kinda wish I-I would’ve been there to feel the kicking for the first time y’know.|Well I got stuff going on in here  if you wanna feel.
Look, I-I don’t want to miss anymore baby stuff. So…Here. Here’s my new pager number, okay? Anytime anything pregnancy related happens use it! I’ll be there! Okay? I don’t care if it’s three in the morning and all you want is ice cream.|Wow! Can I get a copy of that?
Are you under the sheet?|Yes.
How’s the pressure?|Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good!
Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it’s not weird is it.|No. Ooohh…
That’s right, you just enjoy.|Oh. Oh yeah! Ohhhhh! Ohh! Oh yeah!
Okay.|Oh God Phoebe!!
I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I wasn’t trying to open your closet! I swear!|Whoa, Monica runs a pretty tight ship over here. What are you doing?
Monica has a secret closet and she won’t let me see what’s in it.|Why not?
I don’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can’t see?!|I don’t know. Ooh, I bet it’s Richard.
Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?|Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she’s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!
And here we go…|I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y’know it wouldn’t kill ya to respect your wife’s privacy!  Stupid closet full of bugs!
Hey! So?|She’s fine. She’s experiencing Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild discomfort caused by contractions in the uterine wall.
So but everything is normal.|Absolutely.
And-and there’s no danger to her and the baby?|No-no. Contractions can be unnerving if you don’t know what they are, but she’s fine.
Calm?! I wasn’t calm! I’ve never been more scared in all my life!|But wait you said everything was gonna be okay.
Well what do I know?! I’m not a doctor!|But I—But everything is okay. I’m fine!
You sure?!|Yes! Yes! I got half a mind to contract that doctor’s uterus though. Mild discomfort, what’s he talking about?
Oh hey-hey!|Is everything okay?
Something called Braxton-Hicks contractions.|Oh. Oh. Thank God, most women don’t even feel them.
Hey uh, what’s with the candy?|Oh when you beeped me I was on line at the concession stand at the movie theater.
Oh hey, don’t worry about it man. Don’t worry about it, no big deal.|Yeah but still, I mean it should’ve been me. I’m the dad.
There has got to be a way!|Easy there Captain Kirk. Oh, do you have a bobby pin?
Yeah.  Oh no wait, I’m not an nine-year-old girl.|Then why do you throw like one?
Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.|Sure. "Monica."
So, how’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?|Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  By the way, I have no idea what I’m doing here. For all I know I’m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?
That’s a good idea.|Yeah.
Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?|Oh, I just…I feel terrible.
Hey.|Hey.
I gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. That massage felt so good!|No-no, I got that.
So umm, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?|Okay. Okay but you should know though, I’ve raised my rates to $200 an hour.
Okay.|I mean $500.
What?|600.
What’s going on?|Oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged!
What?|Yeah, and it really freaked me out! And after a while I even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.
What?! You’re crazy! There’s nothing sexual about the noises I make!|Really? There’s nothing sexual about this?  I mean hi.
Oh my—This is so embarrassing. Oh my God, I’m never gonna get massaged again!|No, you can’t let this stop you from getting massages! No look, I have, I have lots of clients that make the same noises you do!
Really?!|Well not clients, lovers. But let’s just y’know, try it again. Come back and-and we’ll work through it.
Are you sure?|Yes.
I guess.|Great! Okay, if you’ll just excuse me.  So, did you hear something you liked?
Hey Ross! Check it out! I learned a new trick!|Hey uh, I brought you some lunch.
Ohh! That’s so sweet of you! Oh yum!  Did you put pickles on this?|Well yeah!
Oh Ross!!|What?! What?! Rach what?!
Yeah, I’ll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?|I’m on it!
Well, if anyone is keeping score, I no longer eat tuna.|Hey uh, can I, can I talk to you guys for a second?
What’s up?|Uh, sit down. I wanna talk about our situation.
Are you breaking up with us?|The thing is…’cause I live with Rachel I’m here for a lot of the stuff, okay?  And Ross…Ross is missing everything. So…
Yeah?|Maybe you two should live together.
Are you asking me to move out? Do you not want me here?|Oh no-no, no-no I love living with you. It just seems that…if you’re gonna have a roommate, y’know it might as well be the father.
But Joey, I don’t think Ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that. I mean——Or he does.|No I-I-I would love to be around for you and the baby. And we-we can just try it like on a temporary basis.
But Ross, its you and me!|So? Sure! But it-it wouldn’t be anything romantic. And I’m-I’m dating Mona—Damnit Mona! I was supposed to meet her like an hour ago! What is wrong with me?!
I don’t know. Is it crazy?|No! No it’s not. Joey, this is a smart idea.
Okay, let’s do it. I’ll move in.|Really?
Yeah.|Oh Rach that’s great. That’s great.
Not to shabby, I got this all off myself…using my wife’s tools.  Oh my God!|How did you get in there?!
You’re messy.|Oh no! You weren’t supposed to see this!
I married Fred Sanford!|No Chandler, you don’t understand!  Okay! Okay! Okay! Fine! Now you know. Okay? I’m y’know…I’m sick.
No, honey you’re not sick! Look, I don’t love you because you’re organized, I love you in spite of that.|Really? You promise you won’t tell anyone?
Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet.|Well…it’s just umm…I’m afraid you might mess it up.
Hey.|Hey.
So Rachel’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?|Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn’t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it’s a couple weeks past it’s expiration date, so it’s got a bit of a kick.
Are you okay?|Are you kidding me? I’m great! Yeah, I’m uh; I’m better than great. I am good. And now that she’s gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn’t do before. Y’know? Like umm, I can walk around naked again. Y’know? I can uh, I can watch porn in the living room. Right? This is uh, this is good for me. Y’know? I like being on my own, I’m uh, better off this way. I’m uh, a lone wolf. Y’know? A loner. Alone. All alone. Forever. What’s a wolf got to do to get a huh around here?!
Ohhh.|That’s it. Just relax.
Ohh. Oh! Ohh!|Come on more!
Oh God!|Yeah, you like that don’t you?
Oh yeah right there!|You want it there? You take it there baby!
Uh Phoebe?|Yeah, say my name. Say it!  And now I’m going to cover you back up, and umm we’re never doing this again.
Oh! Hey, Rach!|Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine’s Day!
Oh, you, too.|Hey, so, uh, how’s it going living over at Ross’?
Okay.|Bye.
Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?|Thanks. But maybe later.
Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?|You want anything?
So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?|Oh, I’m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she’s been away all week visiting her parents, but she’ll be cool. I mean, she’s been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, ‘Fossils are my friends.’
Ugh. Come on, Mona, don’t kiss ass.|Uh, I’m going to take off.
All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!|What is it?
It’s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?|All right.  ‘Candy and Cookie?’
Yeah. Candy’s the mother, Cookie’s the daughter. The father’s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?|Phoebe, c’mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
Oh, Monica, grow up!|Hey, what’s behind your back?
Hey. Look, I know you’ve been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.|No, I’m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
He-hee!|Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!|Thanks so much, Pheebs!  Oh! Not that kind of fun.
Happy Valentine’s!|Okay! I’ll be right out. I’m slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
|Yeah, just relax.
Woah, woah, that’s not pretty!|Now, push!
Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!|Ohhh! Make it stop!
Did I just throw this?|Hi.
Hi.|I accidentally packed these with my stuff.  Who is this?
Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Phoebe’s friend’s dog. I don’t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.|
I’ve still got it!|Why did you get me this?
What is it?|It’s yelling…bleeding…dilating. Oh, the dilating…
Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe’s. Why were you even watching it?|I thought…maybe…you got me porn for Valentine’s Day.
Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine’s Day…  Oh, wait a minute. Those aren’t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?|Well, I’m not really in a sexy mood right now.
Honey, what’s going on?|Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
Mm-hmm.|How long it took to go back in the water?
Chandler, we can’t let this tape wreck Valentine’s Day!|You don’t know. You didn’t see it.
Child-birth, it’s a natural thing! It’s beautiful.|Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!|See, honey, there’s—
Hi!|Hey!  So, how was Atlantic City?
Good.|Yeah?
I brought you back a present.|Wha—? Oh, come on. You didn’t have to—saltwater taffy?!  Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it’s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That’s not interesting.
I think it’s interesting.|I do too! I missed you!
I missed you, too! So, how was your week?|Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
How exciting!|Yeah! I know! It was. Oh… the only sad thing is I wasn’t around when it happened for the first time.
Oh no.|Yeah, I’m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
Yeah right!|What?
Joey cracks me up! It’s like, ‘Yeah, why don’t you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn’t be awkward at all!’|Huh…uh-huh.
So, what’d you tell him?|
How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?|I don’t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
Taffy, really? I’ve never had any.|Ever?!
Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.  Thank you! So what, you’re just never going to tell her?|Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I’m going to take her to an amazing Valentine’s dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I’m the best boyfriend in the world, then I’m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn’t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.|Hey!
Hey.|Hey, buddy. How’s my favorite dog, huh? How’s my favorite dog?  Did you give him a beer?
No.|Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.  Oh, me, right!|He’s miserable! What happened to him?
Nothing. We just talked about stuff.|What stuff?
Rachel stuff.|Oh…Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
He’s breathing!|Okay, I’m going to take him back to Wendy’s.
Well, I’m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?|Oh, I’ve got big Valentine’s plans! I’ve got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
Y’know, it’s interesting! Most people think that’s made with seawater, when in fact—|Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
Mona? What are—hi! What are you doing here? I’m, um, supposed to pick you up!|Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine’s dinner! Surprise!
Ayyyayyyy!|Oh, hey, Mona!
I have no idea!|I’ll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
Uh…lately, she just likes hanging out here.|Why?
I think she’s lonely.|Okay, but it’s Valentine’s Day!
I know.|Can’t we just ask her to go?
No, no. She’s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.|I’m not here! That’s just my Chinese food!
Mm-hmm. She’s—she’s emotional, but, but ballsy.|You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don’t you, uh, open the champagne, and I’ll be right back. I’ve got a surprise for you.|You got another ex-wife back there?
|I’m just going to grab the phone.
How long has it been this time?|90 seconds.
That’s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it…except all I did was think about it.|You know, it haunts me? Up ‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don’t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?|I can do that.
Okay.|Okay. Now all we’ve got to do is get rid of this chair.
Oh, thank God!|Oh, I know!
Come in!|Hi! I’m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine’s, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
Oh, my God.|Poor Ross.
Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It’s here.|Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don’t watch it.
No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!|C’mon, seriously, you guys, you’re not going to make me watch this alone!
She’s right…of course not. Honey, get the tape.|Okay, here we go.
It’s…still beautiful.|Uh! It’s horrible!
I know! I know, I’m so sorry for you!|Oh, my God!
Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!|And look how happy the mom is now!
Oh…Rach!|Oh, screw you guys, you don’t have to do it!
Hey, hey, man!|Hey, what’s up?
Uh…Mona just dumped me.|Oh, man, I’m sorry. Why?
Well, with everything that’s been going on lately, I haven’t exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn’t tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?|Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine’s Day.
Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine’s Day? What’s going on, huh? Girl trouble?|Sort of.
Really?!|You don’t have to seem so happy about it.
Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.|Oh, I…I d—
Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?|Forget about it. It’s no big deal.
C’mon! Joey! What is it?|It’s nothing.
Hey, hey, it’s me. Why can’t you tell me?|Okay, uh…sit down.  Um… there’s this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh…it can’t happen.
She’s not a Tribbiani?|No!
I knew it. So, is she someone from work?|Yes.
Well, uh, does she like you?|Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn’t matter, because I can’t do anything about it.
Why not?|Well, it’s complicated. She’s with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we’re really good friends.
So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he still in love with her?|No. I don’t think so.
Okay. Um… is he a good guy?|Yeah, he’s the best.
Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.|Oh, I don’t know.
Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.|I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—
Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.|Here’s your warm milk.
I’m going to…uh…I’m going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.|Oh, yeah.
Anyway… seriously, uh…just…just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.|It’s Rachel.
|I came to the big city to become a star! I’ll do…anything to make that happen!
Hmm…maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.|Previously on Friends
There’s this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it’s complicated.  She’s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I could never do that to the guy, y’know?  ’Ccause we’re really good friends.|So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh… is he a good guy?
Yeah, he’s the best.|Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
Oh, I don’t know.|Joey, it’s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
I do! So much! I can’t stop thinking about her! I can’t sleep, I—|Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
Did you um—I’m sorry, did you just say it’s Rachel?|Yes.
Um, you…you like Rachel?|Yes. I like Rachel.
Rachel?!|Yeah, okay but look, buy uh—Hey-hey, y’know, y’know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn’t get said enough. I like you Ross.
But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?!|Yeah, but it’s not a big deal.
It’s not a big deal? Oh, I’m sorry I just…um, I…what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like—you-you can’t stop thinking about her. Like how you can’t sleep?|I’m an actor, y’know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.
Rachel who’s carrying my baby? Rachel?|Look no, I-I know it’s bad, and I know it’s wrong. Okay? But-but it’s not like anything’s ever gonna happen. Y’know? These-these are just feelings, they’re gonna go away.
Y’know what? I-I gotta go.|Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don’t…
I just—y’know—I-I just have one—Rachel?!|Rachel?!!
Oh-oh! Okay, she’s kicking!|Oh!  She’s growing inside you.
Whoa!!|Oh!
Wow that was a big one.|I think that’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
Hi!|Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?
Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That’s why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He’ll find me.|Uh-huh,  and you?
Well, what’s he like?!|Well he’s tall.
Uh-huh.|He has brown hair.
Of course, of course.|A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!
Oh sure. Older?|Obviously, and he’s British.
Oh, I was just gonna ask!|Yeah? And, he’s-he’s so centered and mature and confident.
Oh, it’s so sad they never had a chance to meet.|Luckily, the guy she settled for can’t hear what you’re talking about.
Hey.|Hey.
I just talked to Joey, I just—I want to see how you were.|Oh y’know, I still—I can’t believe it. Joey and Rachel I mean it’s… It’s like you and me going out, only weirder!
All right, I know you’re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive, but don’t say that again.|Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he’d be the stepfather of my child.
Honey, I don’t think that’s something we need to worry about! First of all he’s-he’s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she’d react.|Sure, because women never like Joey. Y’know, I think he’s a virgin.
Joey…he’s not even thinking about going after Rachel!|He’s not?
No! All he’s thinking about is how you’re taking this! I mean, listen it’s totally freaking him out. He’s talking about moving to Vermont.|Why?
He says he wants to leave the country.  He thinks you hate him.|Hate him? I… No, I don’t hate him.  It’s just it’s Rachel, y’know?
Honey I can’t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don’t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you’re still his friend.|Okay. Okay, I’ll talk to him.
Oh! Hi!|Hi!
Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.|Oh, hello.
Soul mate.|What?
Nothing! I swear to God I didn’t know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn’t believe in soul mates. So…|I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!
They’re just talking, and y’know what? Just because I think they’re soul mates doesn’t mean anything’s gonna happen.|Phoebe, good work.
Yeah?|Yeah! Oh he’s great, I love him.
Hey.|Hey.
Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.|No, I don’t want to hit you.
Oh what then? Kick me?|No.
Bite me?|No, no I don’t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I’m not mad at you and…and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.
Oh now—Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?|Uh…yeah sure.
Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don’t…|Okay.
|Thank you.
Anyway, it uh…look it’ll just…take me a while to get over her, that’s all. I’m not even sure how to do that, I mean I’ve never been in love before so…|What?! You’re in love with her.
Yeah, I thought you knew that.|Umm, no.
Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don’t want to feel this way. Honest. I just keep thinking, "Ah, I’ll get over this." Y’know? I just—It just keeps gettin’ harder. I don’t, I don’t know what to do. Y’know? What do I do?|I think you need to tell her how you feel.
Okay that’s the green stuff talkin’.|No, I’m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she’s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.
But what if uh—and I’m not saying she will be—But…|If she is where you are then uh…then my feeling weird about it shouldn’t stand in the way.
Are you sure?|Yeah. Look if-if she’s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn’t find a better guy. So…
Hey thanks.|So when do you think you’re gonna talk to her?
Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven’t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?|I’m understanding, but let’s not get carried away.
I’m sorry, you’re right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!|Yeah, tell me about it.
…so I’ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the cheese side of things.|Cheese you say? That’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?
Excuse me?|Cheese, it’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.
Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I’m one of the people who thinks the smellier the better.|Me too! Yeah, Chandler can’t stand it. He won’t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.
And you’re still married to him?|You know what I’d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese—Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries…  And pate. Oh, I’m really not high, it’s just I used to be fat.
Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I’ve got a great little villa you can stay at.|Is it made of cheese?
No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn’t that be incredible?!|I’d move in tomorrow!
Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand up straight.|Joey? What’s up?
I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.|Okay what’s up?
Here? In the hall? What are we animals?|Well honey, I’m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?
Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I…want to have dinner with you tonight. That’s all.|Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to meet you. Okay?
I’d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn’t that be nice?|Sure, why don’t you set it up. I’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals.
Are you okay? You’ve been acting weird all afternoon.|Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.
Jeez! What is with you?|I’m sorry, did you say cheese?
All right, what’s going on?|Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.
Chandler, you don’t believe in soul mates?|No. But I’m sure  ‘tomatoes’ does.
I don’t believe in soul mates either.|You don’t?
No. I don’t think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.|So you…you don’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
No, I’ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?|I love you.
I know.|Y’know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers .  No? Really? They taste so good.
…and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he touches my stomach. I mean I’m really worried the baby’s not going to like him.  Are you okay?|What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason…—Is it hot in here?
No. Not-not for me, but why don’t you take off your sweater?|I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.
Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?|Yeah. Sure.
Huh. Wow, I wouldn’t think Hobbs would like that so much.|Uh… How long have we known each other?
Um, seven…e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.|Uh-huh, long time.
Yeah.|But over the past few weeks…
So you were saying?|I’m not quite sure.
Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and umm…now here we are.|Yeah, here we are. Uhh… I… I think I’m…falling in love with you.
What?|I’m falling in love with you.
Okay. Umm… I-I…uh, wow. Are you uh… How did umm… When?|Does it really matter?
Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.|Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don’t have to say anything. You-you uh, you take as much time as you need.  Okay, you gotta say something!
Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I…|But.
Joey.|Yeah-yeah right. That’s okay. That’s fine. That’s uh, pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it’s no big deal. All right? I think I’m gonna go.
No! Joey please! Please don’t! Please don’t leave like this! Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman!|Don’t start doing that. You can’t do that Rach, ‘cause then you’re gonna make me do that.
Can I?|Sure!
Oh Joey honey I don’t…I don’t want to lose…|Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can’t. Okay? Ever!
I’m so sorry.|Oh no-no Rach, please, don’t be sorry. Okay? Don’t be sorry.  Y’know I was only kidding you.
Is this your table?|Yeah.
God, you’re gonna be here all night!|I know! I haven’t even read them the specials yet!
What’s the matter with them?|I don’t know. I think maybe one of them is dying.  The guy is really cute!
Oh God! That’s Rachel!|Joey, you have to talk to her!
No-no, I can’t! I can’t! Not after the other night, it’s just it’s…too weird, okay? Don’t tell her I’m here!|Hey!
Yeah, a naked bagel game?  Dude, I don’t know. That’s a pretty small hole.|Honey, you gotta talk to her.
I can’t! Y’know? You guys don’t know what it’s like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.|I don’t know what that’s like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
All right so, so what do I do?|This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it’s weird, it’s awkward, but you gotta at least try.
Yeah. Okay.  I almost forgot this was on your…|We didn’t play it!!
Okay, so when you’re done with your tea I’ll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.|I didn’t know you read tea leaves.
Oh yeah, I’ve done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y’know, and-and y’know, one of the great joys of life is it’s-it’s wondrous unpredictability. Y’know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.|Okay, I’m done. Read mine.
Okay.  Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.|I-I’m the head chef. I-I can’t get promoted.
Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who’s next?|Okay, I’m done. Do mine.
Okay.  Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.|Ah.
Oh!  Which can either mean you’re having a baby or you’re gonna make a scientific discovery!|Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
Umm… Wow, all right.|Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It’s a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
|Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute!  Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it’s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.|I know it’s tough now, but things will get better.
How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even be in the same room with each other?!|I’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!|Okay, I-I’m sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
Oh yeah. That makes sense.|Yeah, like I don’t know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
Ooh, I can do that.|Good.  Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
Hi.|Uh I really don’t know what to tell you Rach, I really don’t. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
What?|Yeah Joey she’s…Rachel’s got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow!
Yeah it’s umm… Yeah it’s uh… It-it’s y’know—It’s nothing.|Huh. Okay.  So uh, I think I’m gonna take off.
Yeah—No wait! Joey no wait it is. It’s something. It’s-it’s umm…it’s my boss.|Yeah?
Yeah, and umm my baby.|Yeah?
My boss wants to buy my baby!|What?! Oh my-oh my God!
I know I told you, it’s a really big problem.|What he wants to buy your baby?!
Can you believe that?!|That’s crazy!
That’s what I told him!|Okay, how did this even happen?
Well I’ll tell ya!  See uh my-my boss and his wife—They-they can’t have children. So umm, and that—we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."|Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
Oh hello.|Oh, it’s you. I see you everywhere. I’m Jim, Jim Nelson.
Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I’m Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.|We have. Maybe we’ll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o’clock?
Mona?|I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.|Honey, both yours.
What problem did you tell him you had?|Oh that’s not important. The point is, I really—I think everything’s gonna be okay.
May I help you?|Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
Isn’t it funny how we kept running into each other? It’s as if someone really wants us to be together.|Someone does. Me.
Oh, witty banter. Well done.|So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
Oh okay, well I’m a masseuse, and I used to work at this place…|Do you like to party?
I-I-I like, I like parties.|You’re wild, aren’t ya?
Yeah I guess, a little.|It ain’t no thing, I’m wild too.
So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm—Well since I was fourteen.|I’m sorry. I’m staring. It’s just that you have the most beautiful eyes.
Oh stop it.|And your breasts! Hmm!!!
Okay. Umm look, you’re coming on a little strong. But I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don’t we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.|All right.
Okay.|I write erotic novels, for children.
What?!|They’re wildly unpopular.
Oh my God!|Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
Wow! You do?|Yeah,  a Pretty Huge…
…there’ll be sun.|Hey!
You can always sell your baby.|Oh Joey, I can’t believe you brought my boss into this! I’m gonna get fired!
Oh my God! Ross!!!|Hello!!
Ross, what are you doing?!|Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
Morning. You wanted to see me?|Please, come in. Have a seat.
Okay look Mr. Zelner…|Oh I think it’s best that I speak first.
Yeah.|I’ve asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
Oh God.|If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby…I am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
Oh there it is.|That’s not your regular dry cleaners.
I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store…|What?!
A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that’s what they gave me?  When I get up there I’m going to kick some ass.|Don’t worry Phoebe, you’re gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
Oh, you didn’t have to come in with me.|Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I’m-I’m gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
Okay.|Wow!
What?|I’m sorry, it’s just that you’re so incredibly beautiful.
Oh yeah well, I’m sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?|I hope you don’t think I’m crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
A little.  Now you’re talking.|Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
I-I-I’d love to. Let me just tell my friend.|Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
Hi.|So? What-what-what happened?
It’s all gonna be okay. They’re just so happy that I’m not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.|Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they’re not in the baby buying business.
Chandler, can you give us a minute?|Oh I’m sorry, you’re kicking me out of my own living room?
Yeah.|I’ll be in there.
Joey, I’m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things…|I know. I know.
It kinda worked. I mean y’know, I don’t know about you buy I haven’t thought about our thing since all this.|Hey you’re right. Yeah, it’s kinda been like us again a little bit.
Yeah I know! I miss that.|Me too. I mean I…haven’t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn’t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
|Listen Ross, you don’t have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
You do?|Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can’t. It’s too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just… It just wasn’t meant to be.
Oh God you’re right.|Ross, we…we have to be strong. Okay, I-I’m gonna go.  Can I? To remember you?
|Mark Kunerth
Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent’s anniversary party?|Yeah.
Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.|Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers?  Who said that?
Yeah, he’s really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.|Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
What are you doing?|Oh I’m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.
It’s a dog.|It’s a dead dog. That’s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
It’s your parents’ anniversary and you’re going to talk about their dead pet?|The good stuff, huh?
Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt,  and I think my testacles may be in here too.|Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y’know Monica couldn’t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
Ha!|Why don’t all of you tell me a little about your self?
Yeah.|And I’ve got the car keys.
Hi|Hi!  Hey mom.
Open it! Open it! Open it!|Yeah baby!
But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.|Where did you have it?
On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn’t She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.|Really?
Yeah, Stevie’s an old family friend.|Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
So would I. You wouldn’t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.|Would you excuse us for a second?  Umm…. what are you doing?
What? I’m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.|Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.|Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.|Blind?
Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.|I’ll bet you looked beautiful…
Well, I don’t know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.|So, how did you propose?
Oh yeah. That’s a great story.|Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That’s-that’s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower…
Shhh! I want to hear the rest!|Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
And the ring, was the size of my fist !|Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker’s a nice guy and I’d like to get to know him.
My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!|Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words…|Oh thank God.
It’s a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst…|Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don’t we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
That sounds great.|Let’s try something else, let’s play a game.
I love games!|Shocking! Let’s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
Or…Jenga.|But, let’s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
I lose, now Jenga.|Oh my God! Oh my God!
Is something wrong?|Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn’t perfect? Everything isn’t magical? Everything isn’t a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!|You don’t have to put a good spin on everything.
I’m sorry that’s who I am. I’m a positive person.|No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?|Much less happy!
Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I’d better be going."|So long! Don’t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
Isn’t this the most incredible fight you’ve ever had in your entire life?|Uh huh.
…and then, we could’ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!|Ross, it just wouldn’t have been feasible.
But having a dove place the ring on your finger would’ve been no problem?|It was really fun being married to you tonight.
Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I’ve ever made.|Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
Yeah.|That proposal, at the planetarium…
I know, I know it was stupid.|Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was…really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It’s how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.|Well, that would’ve been very hard to say no too.
It’s a good thing I didn’t do it, because it sounds like it would’ve been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night|Goodnight
Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn’t get messed up?|I will think about it.
Okay that’s it. I give up. At mom and dad’s 40th anniversary, you’re the one giving the speech.|Y’know I don’t understand why they didn’t cry. It was a beautiful speech.
Oh, come on.|Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
Hi!|Hey!
So, I’m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down.|Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That’s me!! I’m blank!!
So did they call you to tell you your name’s gonna be in this?|No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.
Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y’know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don’t know, gal pal Rachel Green?|Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
Okay, don’t listen to him. Please?|Fine! All right, I’ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y’know, start to say something stupid.
Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green.  Seriously, proud of you.|Yeah.
I really appreciate you taking the time to do this.|Oh, not at all. Happy to do it.
You think we’re being obvious?|No, we’re just four people with neck problems. You talk like this.
Y’know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y’know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.|Actually, I didn’t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn’t have mattered, I’m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.
Umm, I’ll have a cup of coffee.|And I’ll have all the muffins.
Hey!|Shhh! We’re not talking.
Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.|Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!
This is the first time he’s ever used this product, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.  This works with any milk carton.|Now, I can have milk everyday.
So this is it? Victor?|Yeah, I guess it is. And so… I’m gonna get on this spaceship,  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne… baby…I’m gonna want to meet her.
Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do…so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad for the paper tray.|Nice work my friend.
I’m gonna get some coffee, anyone want anything?|Oh yeah, I’d actually love a blueberry muffin and a chamomile tea.
Who names their boat Coast Guard anyway?|That is the Coast Guard.
Hey!|Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!
Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?|Come on, it's fun!
All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?|Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!
Y’know what, we have to turn off the porn.|I think you’re right.
All right, ready?|One.
Two.|Three.
Yeah, that’s kinda a relief.|Yeah.
You wanna see if we still have it?|Yeah.
FREE PORN!!!|Yeah!!
In my spare time I uh, read to the blind. And I’m also a mento for the kids.|A mento…
Right.|Like the candy?
Matter of fact, I do.|Well umm, another thing our readers always want to know is how our soap stars stay in such great shape. Do you have some kind of fitness regime?
Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?|Are you serious?!
Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.|Wow! We are pretty good at this!
Yeah!|Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!
What’s wrong with you?|Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, haven’t been able to stand up since. But um, I don’t think it’s anything serious.
This sounds like a hernia. You have to—you-you—Go to the doctor!|No way! ‘Kay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything it’s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach!  Damn you 15s!
It tastes like feet!|I like it.
Are you kidding?|What’s not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Goooooood.
The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes—Hey, what was in that brown jar?|That’s still in there?!
Oh! Yay! Look! There’s a piece that doesn’t have floor on it!|Stick to your side!
Hey, come on now!|
Uhh, I don’t believe in these crazy diets y’know, just everything in moderation.|Your muffins.
I’ll take those to go.  For the kids.|Oh, I know what I wanted to ask you. You were on the show years ago and then they killed you off. What happened there?
It was so stupid, I said some stuff in an interview that I shouldn’t have said. But believe me, that’s not gonna happen today.|Understood. So, what’d you say back then?
You guys, this is Shelley, she’s interviewing me for Soap Opera Digest, and Shelley, this are my friends…|gal pal Rachel Green.
Okay.|Joey! You’re doing great!
No thanks.|So, as Joey’s friends, is there anything that you guys think our readers ought to know?
How come you have two?|Well this one's for you.
Get out.|No, I can't. No-no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,  best buds.
Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.|That's what they'll call us.
Oh, Joey! Sorry!|No that’s all right. Don’t worry about it.
Oh but look! That’s gonna leave a stain!|Rach! Hey! It’s fine! You’re at Joey’s!
Really?|Yeah! Look!
I’ve never lived like this before.|I know.
All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and damnit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes .|Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl.
All right. Let's get the contestants out of their isolation booths.|Get your foot off my contestant! Judge!
Judge rules, no violation.|Ohhh.
And the duck gets the Nutter-Butter!|No!! Hey-hey that's not a Nutter-Butter, that's just an old Wonton!
Judge rules, Nutter-Butter.|Ohh, tough call.
I’d seen this thing on The Discovery Channel...|Wait a minute! I saw that! On The Discovery Channel, yeah! About jellyfish and how if you...  Ewwww!! You peed on yourself?!
Umm, no. No best friend, no. Just a lot of close friends.|So umm, now back to the show. How does it feel to have a huge gay fan base?
What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!|Your make-up!
Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we’re face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we’re-we’re butt to face.|I think face to face.
I would say that.|Face to face, yeah!
Okay, here I go.|All right.
I prefer not to answer that right now, I’m still carrying a little holiday weight.|Y’know, when we talked about face to face, I don’t think we thought it all the way through.
Hey Pheebs!|Hey!
Check it out.  How much of a man am I?!|Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.
You’re turning into a woman.|No I’m not. Why would you say that? That’s just mean.
Now I’ve upset you? What did I say?|It’s not what you said. It’s the way you said it… Oh My God, I’m a woman!!!
Great nap.|It really was.
Uh me? Gay? No! No. No, but I have a number of close friends who are.|So, let’s talk about women. I’m sure our female readers will be interested to know about your romantic life.
Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doin’?"|Oh, please!
Hey! How you doin’?|He has the most amazing Porsche under there!
Hi, is Rachel here? I’m her sister.|Oh my God, Jill!
No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.|Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
I don't think so.|Oh, I do.  How you doin?
I'm okay.|What?!?! Oh dear God!
Not much to tell there I’m really shy.|So, that’s it. I guess that’s all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month.
Oh great! Great! Thank you.|Bye.
Bye-bye.  I did it!|Yeah!
Oh, I don’t watch soap operas. Excuse me, I have a life, y’know?|Thank you. The readers at Soap Opera Digest will be happy to hear that.
Wow! I can’t believe they didn’t put it in the part where you said you didn’t watch soap operas.|Yeah, I called the lady about that. I told her I was just joking. She was pretty nice about that.
Hi!|Hey!
So what’s the final head count on my baby shower?|About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
What?! You mean they’re not coming to a social event where there’s no men and there’s no booze?! That’s shocking! I don’t care, as long as my mom’s here.|Oh my God, your mother!
What?! My mom’s not gonna be here?!|Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
My God!|Well it wasn’t my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!|No.  Neither is mine.
Please, make sure she comes. It’s really important to me, I mean it’s my mom!|I know. I know, what’s her number?
I don’t know.|Go! I have it in my book. Go!  Wait a minute! If you’re in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her—Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it’s Monica Geller.
Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?|Oh no, I can’t go. I’m practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
That’s great.|Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I’ll  Joey Trrrribbiani!
You’ll be perfect for this! That’s already your name!|But the audition’s in a couple hours and I don’t even understand the game.
Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.|All right! Let’s play Bamboozled!
Bamboozled?|Yeah, isn’t that a cool name?
No!|All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don’t you tell us a little something about you Ross?
Well Joey, I’m a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!|Excellent! Let’s play Bamboozled! Chandler, you’ll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
Bogota.|It’s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
What does a Wicked Wango card do?|I should know that. Let’s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
Higher or lower than what?|This is embarrassing.
Can you believe how lame this is?|I’m sorry, I don’t believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That’s good right?|You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
What? He’s gonna be dressed as a baby!  Oh hi Mrs. Green!|Hi!
I’m so glad you could make it.|Yes, thank you so much. And again, we’re so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
Yeah I know. Isn’t it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.|Phoebe, Sandra’s mad at you too. It-it doesn’t bother you?
No look, we’ve apologized twice! I can’t do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.|Okay. I can do that.  I gotta go powder my ass.
Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn’t know better I’d say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let’s get some tea.|Okay.
Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don’t want you to use your housekeeper ‘cause it would just split her focus.|Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don’t even have a housekeeper.
It’s like you’re a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don’t know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.|Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.
Such a sweet woman.|Well, however great she was I just can’t afford that.
Oh Rachel!|What?
I just had the greatest idea! I’m gonna come live with you!|Wh-wh-what? What?
Oh, I’m so happy I’m gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.|Yes. Yes I do.
All right Ross you’re in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?|The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I’ll take another question.
Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.|It’s okay, I’m ready.
No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you’re ready to answer the question.|This is ridiculous, he’s not gonna hold his breath…
Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris…Holy cow, that’s a big word. Trisc… Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?|Let me see that.
This one right here.|Triscadecaphobia.
No! No, fear of the number 13.|Fear of Triscuts?
All right Chandler, you’re up.|Wait a minute, I-I believe I’m entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.|Let me think. Let me think—Oh! I don’t care.
You-you must choose Mr. Bing.|Either, it makes no difference.
Choose, you jackass!|I’ll take a card.
Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross’s points!|What?!
Why did you invite my mother?!|What?
She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.|For how long?
Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.|I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?|Well, if you don’t want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
You’re right. You’re right. I mean I’m about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don’t want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She’s gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!|That’s right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don’t want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
Okay.|This is great! Now she’s gonna be mad at Rachel! Y’know what? And I’m just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
Mom that’s okay that you didn’t get you a gift!|Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.|Sweetheart I know you’re gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
But mom, I really know what I’m doing. I can handle this.|Really? Remember Twinkles?
He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!|Okay, come on Rach it’s present time! Y’know you’re the glue that’s holding this whole party together. It’s kinda falling apart here.
Wow!|Okay, this is from your friend at work.
Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is!  Wait a minute. That can’t be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?|Darling, that’s a breast pump!
Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What’s this?|It’s a diaper genie.
Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!|No! It’s where you put the dirty ones!
Well that’s gross, why don’t you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?|Oh you’re gonna do that ten times a day?
What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!|No dear, that’s what babies do.
I don’t know, I’d leave it on the changing table?  What?! What’d I do? What’d I do?!|You can’t leave a baby alone!
Oh come——Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would—she wouldn’t be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y’know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I’m just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.|It’s actually a bassinet.
In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We don’t need no stinkin’ badges!"|Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
Correct! There’s a possible backwards bonus!|Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
Yes!|I’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
Wise choice, how many rungs?|Six!
That noise can only me one thing.|Hungry monkey.
Okay, it’s an audio question, name this television theme song.|Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
Yes! Yes, you’re back in the lead!|I’d like to spin the wheel!
All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!|Is there a hopping bonus?
Who invented bifocals?|Ben Franklin.
Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?|Queen Victoria.
Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!|Noooo!!! Every time!!!
Now, over to Chandler.|I’d like a Google Card.
Are you sure?|Yes!  Google!
Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you’ve been Bamboozled!|Nooo!!
So umm, you’re gonna stay with me as long as I need you?|Of course I am!
Oh mom, I swear I’m not an idiot. I’ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn’t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby’s coming and I don’t know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?|No. Sweetie, you’re gonna be fine.
Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?|I’m going to the bathroom.
Okay.|Now don’t worry! Everything’s gonna be okay.
Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.|A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
No. She’s going to live with us for eight weeks.|Uh, what?
Yes! She’s gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.|What—You’re not serious. I mean she’s a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She’ll drive us totally crazy.
Hey Joey, hi! I’m Ray; I’m the producer of the show.|It’s a pleasure to meet you Ray.
…and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.|Well we…we don’t have a garage.
Did I say garage? I meant garbage.|Y’know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it’s not absolutely vital that you live with us.
Well Rachel needs help with the baby.|I do. I really do. I don’t know anything.
That’s true. You do have another child.|Yeah.
With another woman. Have you no control Ross?|That’s a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to…to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
Well then you really don’t need me to live with you.|Yes! Yes, you’re gonna be so missed.
You’re gonna be a great father.|Well you’re gonna be a wonderful grandma.
All right you two, I’m gonna get going.|Oh.
Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I’ll let myself out. It’s like I’m not here, which I almost wasn’t.|What do I do?
Spiteful?!|That’s right! Maybe it’s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady…old lady…lady!
Okay! I’m ready.|You sure?
Yes, I’ve done my studying and I really know my stuff.|All right then.  How do you test the temperature of the baby’s bath water?
Uh, put your elbow in it.|Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.|That’s correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
Check if it’s wet, check if it’s hungry, burp it!|Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
A card! A card! I pick a card!|Oh, I’m sorry you’ve been Bamboozled! You’re gonna be a terrible mother!
Hey you guys I got some bad news.|Well that’s no way to sell newspapers. Why don’t you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
No, Monica’s restaurant got a horrible review in the Post.|Man, this is bad! And I’ve had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though.  "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
Umm…|Oh dear God!
But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.|What about the rest of Manhattan?!
Yeah, they all know.|Oh my God, this is horrible!
Ross!|What?! What?
I am freaking out!|Are ya?
My due date is in one week!|What are you doing up?
That is seven days!|Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after…
No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!|It’s funny you should mention diapers.
I’m serious.|Okay look, there’s nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There’s a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
Okay. Thank you. That’s great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there’s this really cute shoe store that has like this little…|
Oh, wait Ross! I’m sorry, one more thing!|Yeah!
Umm, our situation. Y’know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we’re having this baby together, and we live together. Isn’t that, isn’t that weird?|Well uh…
Hey uh Monica, I can’t remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?|We said at the movies, but…
Okay, I’ll see you there.|Joey!  Now that you’re here…
Sure, I can hang out ‘til I have to meet ya.  What uh—How come you’re not going?|I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
I thought you already have a job.|And people say you don’t pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
Wow! How do you know how to do that?!|That’s what I do now.
What is it?|Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well…  I’m getting my revenge!
You cooked him?|No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?|Oh.
Why don’t you fill out this address card.|Oh, okay.
I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.|Oh yeah! Actually, that’s one of the reasons why we’re not a couple.
Really?! That is so cool!|Oh. Oh yeah, don’t get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he’s a doctor, but he’s not.
Oh no-no, I’m fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?|Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
Oh, I love your neighborhood. There’s a great gym right around the corner from your building.|That’s my gym.
I can tell you work out.|I am like Indiana Jones.
Hi Pheebs!|Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn’t on the list. A whore.|What?!
Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.|Well did she know you two weren’t married?
Yeah.|Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
You don’t understand! You didn’t see how brazen she was.|Sounds like you’re a little jealous.
No! I’m not! I-I-I just think it’s wrong! It’s-it’s that I’m—Here I am about to pop and he’s out picking up some shop girl at Sluts ‘R’ Us!|Is that a real place?  Are they hiring?
Oh yeah! You really—You look great.|Yeah, just don’t get your hopes up.
Hi! Umm, I’m Monica Geller, I’m the chef at Alessandro’s.|Still?
I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.|I don’t see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
Spoon?  So, what do you think?|I’m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
I can.|Okay, go ahead.
Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.|That’s very good, what’s your name?
Monica.|Monica, you go to the head of the class.
All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?|My son? Pretty serious.  What uh, what are you doing here?
So you guys go, have a really good time.|
So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.|Are you okay with this?
Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.|Okay. It was nice to see you.
Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.|Oh umm, actually I umm…
I can’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?|Oh! It’s okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
Oh good. Good, because I’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.|All right, don’t freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
An hour.|I can’t help you.
Phoebe!|All right, all right, we’ll just do our best. Okay? So let’s say I’m the interviewer and I’m meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I’m uh, Regina Philange."
Chandler Bing.|Bing, what an unusual name.
Hi.|Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?|And the cream?
Cheese makes me thirsty.|Okay. Let’s move on.
All right.|Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You’ve never made this before?
…I think you’ll find if I come to work here, I don’t micro-manage. I don’t shy away from delegating.|Um-hmm, that’s good to know. But let’s stop focusing on what you don’t do, and start focusing on what you do do.
What I do do…is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.|I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
Hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.|You gotta go!
Oh!|Okay, don’t worry. You’re ready.
Really?|Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you’ll be great.
Ah Monica, my star student.|Y’know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
|Wow! A star!  I know you all hate me and-and I’m sorry, but I don’t care.
Okay Joey, you’re up next.  This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!|I can an A? In-in school?  Hey, I’m a dork.
I think you should give him your star.|Excuse me? He doesn’t even know what he’s doing!
We’re all beginners here. Nobody knows what they’re doing.|I do! I’m a professional chef!  Oh relax! It’s not a courtroom drama!
If you’re a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?|Yeah!
Oh Alessandro’s! I love that place!|You do?
Oh yes! You’re an excellent chef! As a person you’re a little…|Oh, I’m totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
Very much.|Okay then, I don’t stink. I’m a good chef. Okay.
Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?|Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it’s time to go, it’s time to go.
…also I was the point person on my company’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.|You must’ve had your hands full.
That I did. That I did.|So let’s talk a little bit about your duties.
All right.|Now you’ll be heading a whole division, so you’ll have a lot of duties.
I see.|But there’ll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
Good to know.|We can go into detail…
No don’t I beg of you!|All right then, we’ll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you’ll fit in well here.
Really?!|Absolutely.  You can relax; you did great.
Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y’know I’ve been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing.|Poo?
Oh my God this doesn’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There’s a crazy guy out in the hall!|Poo?!
Hey.|Hi! You’re back from your date!
How are you?|I’m fine, but that’s not important. What’s important is how was she?
Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.|Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
What’s uh, what’s going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?|No! No, she’s—She was nice. I mean, she’s a little slutty, but who isn’t?
I liked her.|Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!|No! It’s just that, Kate bothered me.
Why? What was wrong with her?|There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
Okay, so what’s the matter?|I don’t want you to date her!
Why? What, what are you jealous?|Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don’t want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it’s a terrible thing to even think this, and it’s completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I’m very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
Okay.|What?!
I won’t date. I’ll uh, I’ll be here, with you, all the time.|Really? But I’m being so unreasonable.
True, but you’re allowed to be unreasonable. You’re having our baby.|
Do you feel better?|No, not really. You’re pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
Uh Rach?|Yeah.
Just one thing umm…|Uh-huh.
We live together. You’re having our baby. I’m not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don’t want something more?|Wow! I don’t know, maybe. I’m…
Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin’ around!  Like you did last night when I had to pee?|I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin’ with you too!
Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you…|Oh no-no-no-no, no!
…that you actually…|No that’s just——That’s just ‘cause I’m such a good messer!
Rach?|Yeah?
The bathroom?|Right!
Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that’s the first A I’ve gotten since seventh grade, and I didn’t have to sleep with the teacher this time.|Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
What the hell!|Okay.
Hey! What are you guys looking at?|Oh, it’s a poster for that World War I movie that I’m in, check it out.
Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!|Uh-huh! I know. I’m coming soon to a theater near you! I’m in THX! I’m unsuitable for children!
Now I cannot wait to see this.|Yeah, yeah, it’s already generating Oscar buzz.
That’s right, still no baby!  Come on people! Please make some room!|Uh sweetie, maybe you’d be more comfortable here?
You. Like you haven’t done enough.|Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do. I mean I wish I were a seahorse.
God.  I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!|Oh I know, I’ve been there. I remember toward the end…
Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!|Let’s.
Hey! Did you have the baby yet?|Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? ‘Cause I’ll do it.
He’s not snoozing, he’s teaching a class.|Well then somebody’s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut down to here.
I haven’t seen this dress.|Star in a movie.
You really want to take me?|Yeah! Yeah! I mean I’m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y’know Chandler always supported my career. He’s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.
So you’re never actually going to pay me back?|Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you’re gonna take him? Joey, I don’t think you’re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!
I always knew you were gonna make it. I’m so proud of you.|Thanks. That means a lot to me.
|Oh, I have to pee. If I don’t come out in five minutes it’s because I’ve choked to death on the potpourri stink.
This is so exciting! It’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?|A little tall.
What?|Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller?
Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you’re still pregnant. Oh, I’m sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y’know what? You look great. Yeah, like fifty bucks.|Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a squeeze toy.
It’s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?|Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!
Fine! You’re on!|Okay.
Until then, General Grant, why don’t you set up camp  right there.|Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor’s appointment.
Good God man don’t anger it.|Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am somewhat comfortable.
Ross.|Yeah?
Can I ask you something?|Uh-huh.
When Carol was pregnant with Ben…|Mmm?
…were you this irritating?|Wow!
Excuse me?!|Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you’ve been a little short with me lately. I’m not trying to irritate you.
Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.|Y’know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don’t we not speak until then.
Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That’s great!|Y’know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that’s half human and half pure evil!
